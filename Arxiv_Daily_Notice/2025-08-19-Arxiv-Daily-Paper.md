 - **Abstract**
 Context: Magnetic fields play a pivotal role in dynamics of black hole accretion flows and formation of relativistic jets. Observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provided unprecedented insights into accretion structures near black holes. Interpreting these observations requires a theoretical framework linking polarized emission to underlying system properties and magnetic field geometries. Aims: We investigate how system properties, particularly magnetic field geometry in the event horizon scale region, influence the structure of the observable synchrotron emission in M87*. Specifically, we aim to quantify the sensitivity of observables used by the EHT to black hole spin, plasma dynamics, accretion disk thickness, and magnetic field geometry. Methods: We adopt a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient accretion flow model in Kerr spacetime. We vary magnetic field geometry, black hole spin, accretion disk dynamics, and geometric thickness of the disk. We perform general relativistic ray tracing with a full polarized radiative transfer to obtain synthetic images of M87*. We extract EHT observables, such as disk diameter, asymmetry, and polarimetric metrics from synthetic models. We also consider a number of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations and compare them with the semi-analytical models. Results: We see limited impact of the disk thickness on observables. On the other hand, toroidal field dominated and poloidal field dominated magnetic configurations can be distinguished reliably. The flow dynamics, in particular presence of radial inflow, also significantly impacts the EHT observables. Conclusions: The M87* system is most consistent with a poloidal magnetic field dominated flow with partially radial inflow. While the spin remain elusive, moderate or large positive values are preferred.

 - **Abstract**
 The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a gamma-ray survey telescope utilizing a compact Compton imager design, enabled by an array of 16 high-resolution germanium cross-strip detectors. After its launch into an equatorial Low Earth Orbit (LEO) in 2027, COSI will experience radiation damage primarily due to energetic protons, with the proton fluence dominated by the passage of COSI through the edge of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) for a few minutes each orbit. We have developed a comprehensive program focused on the modeling, characterization, data correction, and physical repair of radiation damage effects in the COSI detectors. We have performed energetic proton beam irradiations of a spare COSI detector at a proton synchrotron, with proton fluences consistent with multiple years of exposure to the COSI space radiation environment. These exposures allow us to characterize the relationship between proton fluence and induced charge trapping. We demonstrate our techniques to correct for trapping effects, as well as characterize the effectiveness of high-temperature annealing on correcting this damage, as characterized by the resulting spectral performance of the detector. We will present our efforts to characterize the effects of radiation damage in the COSI detectors, as well as our techniques for correcting these effects in the data analysis pipeline and ultimately repairing the detectors on orbit every few years through high-temperature annealing.

 - **Abstract**
 Constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity (LPnG) obtained from galaxy power spectra are limited by the perfect degeneracy between the LPnG parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the bias parameter $b_{\phi}$ which encodes the response of galaxy clustering to a change in the amplitude of primordial curvature fluctuations. For galaxies observed by galaxy surveys, the relation between $b_{\phi}$ and the galaxy bias $b_{g}$ is poorly understood and differs significantly from the universal mass function ansatz. In this paper, we investigate this non-universality in the context of dark-matter halos using the Separate Universe framework, focussing on dark-matter halos selected by mass and/or concentration. We show that the Separate Universe framework provides a natural explanation of the observed universality in the bias of dark-matter halos selected purely by their mass, independent of the spherical collapse picture of halo formation. We further propose an explanation for the observed non-universality in halos selected by concentration and corroborate it with $N$-body simulations in scale-free (EdS) and $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ cosmologies. In particular, we show that the relation between $b_{\phi}$ and halo bias $b_{h}$ for halos selected by concentration in matter-dominated cosmologies tends towards universality at the highest halo masses due to such halos gravitationally dominating their environment throughout their evolution. We also argue that concentration-selected halos of lower masses exhibit non-universality due to their mass accretion being significantly affected by the gravitational influence of neighbouring, more massive halos. Our results suggest that any non-universality in high redshift ($z\gtrsim 3$), high-bias objects observed by realistic galaxy surveys is entirely an artifact of the associated selection function.
#### Blue supergiants in the Pinwheel Galaxy M101: comparison with H II region chemical abundances, spectroscopic distance and an independent determination of the Hubble constant

 - **Abstract**
 We present a quantitative spectroscopic study of 13 blue supergiant stars in the Pinwheel Galaxy M101, based on data obtained with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer available at the Keck I telescope. The average stellar metallicity decreases from ~1.9 Zsun near the center of the galaxy to ~0.3 Zsun at the optical outskirts. The galactocentric radial metallicity gradient is statistically consistent with previous studies of the gas-phase oxygen abundance from H II regions using the direct method. The H II region-based Cepheid metallicities used by Riess et al. in their determination of the Hubble constant H_0 are in substantial agreement with our measurements. The direct method gas-phase metallicities of the 18 star-forming galaxies we have analyzed so far, when adjusted upward for a mean ~0.15 dex oxygen dust depletion factor, are in good agreement with those we infer from the supergiants, over a factor of 50 in metallicity. From the same data, we derive an expression for the metal-dependent depletion of oxygen in photoionized nebulae. Utilizing the flux-weighted gravity - luminosity relationship (FGLR) of blue supergiants, we measure a distance to M101, D=6.5 +\- 0.2 Mpc (m-M = 29.06 +\- 0.08), which is within 1 sigma from determinations based on the tip of the red giant branch and Cepheids. With M101 as a nearby SN Ia host and using the observed standardized B-band magnitude of the supernova, our FGLR distance yields an independent value H_0 = 72.5 +\- 4.6 km/s/Mpc.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of quasar host galaxy 3C 297 which is home to a powerful bent-jet radio source suggesting vigorous interaction with a dense ISM and/or jet precession. Archival HST imaging showed interestingly perturbed morphology of the host with a bright ~30 kpc arc feature, extended filamentary structure of line-emitting gas and clumpy blue excess emission co-spatial with the radio hotspots. Our VLT/SINFONI integral-field observations reveal complex, spatially-resolved H{\alpha}+[NII] emission in this source. A prominent blue-shifted wing in H{\alpha} indicates an ionized gas flow extending out to ~18 kpc from the nuclear region. Combining our SINFONI narrow-H{\alpha} data with archival HST/UV and VLA imaging, we map the young stellar population in the host and compare the spatial distribution of star-forming regions with the ionized gas motion and jet structure. In the attempt to characterize the feedback mechanisms in this chaotic system, we suggest that the powerful radio source dominates the feedback with possible contribution from radiation pressure due to AGN accretion. We also propose that the expanding jet cocoon likely shocked the ISM, triggering a kpc-scale ionized gas outflow and new starbursts that enhanced ongoing merger-induced star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme nitrogen enhancement relative to oxygen, recently found in very high-redshift galaxies, has been seen in local star-forming galaxies displaying high log(N/O) values ($\geq\!-1.1$) at relatively low O abundances, 12+log(O/H)$\leq$8. Understanding the physical origins of these extreme N-emitters at low redshifts enables us to better constrain chemical enrichment mechanisms that drove such high log(N/O) values in the early Universe. With direct N and O abundances derived for 944 SFGs with spectroscopic observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1), we report the discovery of 19 extreme N-emitters at low-z (z$<$0.5). Our sample of N-emitters represents a five-fold increase in their known number at low-z with 12+log(O/H)$\leq$8, and statistically, $2.21\pm0.91$\% of DESI DR1 SFGs with reliable O and N abundances obtained directly, are extreme N-emitters. The sample spans a mass range of $\sim 10^7$ - $10^{10}$~M$_{\odot}$ with 12+log(O/H) range of $\sim$7.1 - 8.2, and the N-emitter fraction is found to increase with increasing stellar mass and decreasing metallicity. The most extreme N-emitter in our sample has log(N/O)=$-0.53\pm0.13$, while also having the lowest 12+log(O/H)=$7.08\pm0.09$ and the highest stellar mass, log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$)=$9.95\pm0.13$ among our sample. With galactic chemical evolution models, we show that sustained N-enhancement by asymptotic giant branch stars, in conjunction with presence of outflows, can well explain the high log(N/O) of low-z extreme N-emitters. While single starbursts with outflow are sufficient to explain lower-mass N-emitters, more massive ones require a dual starburst scenario where a secondary starburst is triggered by inflow of gas.

 - **Abstract**
 The association between FRB 20200428D and the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 makes magnetars the leading engine of cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, there is a list of puzzles for this magnetar-for-all-FRBs scenario: known Galactic magnetars are all isolated and none of them are active repeaters; some cosmological repeaters have extremely high repetition rates but without any measurable spin-related periodicity; some show long-term periodic active windows; and some show diverse rotation measure (RM) evolution patterns, such as quasi-periodic fluctuations, sign reversals, and abrupt RM flares. Here we propose a unified theoretical framework for FRBs within the framework of magnetar engine: Most active repeating FRBs originate from magnetars in binary systems with nearly aligned rotation and magnetic axes, some of which with a triple-aligned geometry, i.e. with an alignment with the orbital axis as well; whereas apparent non-repeaters and inactive repeaters originate from magnetars in isolated systems or in binaries with a misaligned geometry. By studying various magnetar formation channels using population syntheses, we show that a few percent of magnetars in the universe can be in binary systems, most with a massive star companion and some with aligned geometry. We suggest that such binary systems can account for the rich phenomenology of active repeaters. We suggest that the existence of a companion helps to maintain the aligned geometry and that the companion may play an active role in triggering FRBs in an active repeater source.

 - **Abstract**
 LDN 1616 is a cometary globule located approximately 8 degrees west of the Orion OB1 associations. The massive OB stars in the Orion belt region act as catalysts, triggering the star formation activity observed in the L1616 region, which is a photodissociation region (PDR). This paper provides an in-depth analysis of gas kinematics within the L1616 PDR, leveraging the Heterodyne Array Receiver Program (HARP) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) to observe 13CO and C18O (3-2) emissions. Employing the Clumpfind algorithm on the C18O emission data, we identify three distinct clumps within this PDR. For each of these clumps, we derive key physical parameters, including the mean kinetic temperature, optical depth, and velocity dispersion. In addition, we compute the non-thermal velocity dispersion and Mach number, providing critical insights into the turbulent dynamics of the gas. A comprehensive evaluation of mass, including virial and energy budget evaluations, is conducted to assess the gravitational stability and star-forming potential of the identified clumps. While previous studies have proposed that radiation-driven implosion (RDI) is the dominant mechanism initiating star formation in LDN 1616, our results suggest that the clumps may represent pre-existing substructures within the PDR. This interpretation is supported by our estimation of a relatively low interstellar radiation field, which, although insufficient to form clumps independently, may enhance gravitational instability through additional compression. Thus, our findings offer a more nuanced perspective on the role of RDI, highlighting its capacity to trigger star formation by amplifying the instability of pre-existing clumpy structures in PDRs like LDN 1616.

 - **Abstract**
 The stochastic self-propagating star-formation (SSPSF) model is an important theoretical framework for explaining how localised star-formation events trigger subsequent activity across galactic discs. While widely used to interpret spiral and irregular structures, its probabilistic rules have lacked a formal statistical foundation. In this work, we establish a connection between the SSPSF model and spatio-temporal point processes (STPP), which describe events in space and time through history-dependent intensities. We show that the SSPSF update law is equivalent to a separable spatio-temporal Hawkes process, and we derive a simple likelihood function that recovers SSPSF parameters from historical star-formation event data under simplifying assumptions. Beyond the statistical formulation, the framework provides a new approach to analysing the propagation of star formation in galaxies, enabling observational surveys of star-forming regions to be interpreted within the STPP framework. Furthermore, the approach naturally extends to continuous-time models, offering a more realistic representation of galactic dynamics.
#### Type IIb Supernova Progenitors in 3D: Variability and Episodic Mass Loss revealed by Radiation-Hydrodynamics Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first 3D Radiation-Hydrodynamics simulations of partially-stripped ($M_\mathrm{core}\sim10M_\odot$, $M_\mathrm{env}\sim0.1-1M_\odot$) Yellow Supergiant ($L\sim10^5$, $T_\mathrm{eff}\approx5000-8000$K) envelopes, constructed with Athena++. These envelope models represent the progenitors of Type IIb supernovae (SNe-IIb), which have lost a substantial fraction of their H-rich envelope before undergoing core-collapse. The luminosity-to-mass ratio is high in these extended envelopes, and convection is strongly driven by Hydrogen and Helium opacity peaks. This surface convection, coupled with changes in the opacity, sustains large-amplitude low-azimuthal-order radial pulsations, creating order-of-magnitude variability in the stellar luminosity on a timescale of tens of days. If persistent prior to a SN-IIb, these variations could herald the upcoming explosion. Supersonic fluid motions across the outer layers of the star lead to both successful and failed mass ejection events, which shape the circumstellar environment and drive episodic mass loss ($\sim10^{-6}-10^{-5}M_\odot/$yr, in outbursts). The resulting 3D gas distribution in the outer atmosphere, responsible for early-time supernova shock-breakout and shock-cooling emission, shows orders-of-magnitude fluctuations in both space and time at any given radial location. This intrinsically complex halo of bound and unbound material complicates predictions for early SN-IIb lightcurves relative to spherically-symmetric models. However, it does provide a natural, self-consistent explanation for the presence and diversity of dense circumstellar material observed or inferred around pulsating evolved stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the second data release of the Systematic Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), focusing on JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy of galaxies across cosmic time. This release includes spectroscopic observations of 166 galaxies spanning $0 < z < 7.5$, sampling star-forming galaxies, quiescent systems, and active galactic nuclei (AGN), with an emphasis on galaxies at cosmic noon ($z \sim 1$-3). We describe the target selection strategy, the observational setup with the G140M/F100LP and G235M/F170LP gratings, and the data calibration process. The final data products include the reduced spectra, redshift catalog, emission-line catalogs produced with \texttt{GELATO} for emission-line galaxies and \texttt{pPXF} fits for quiescent systems, and ancillary spectral energy distribution (SED) fit results derived from multi-band photometry. The SMILES NIRSpec dataset enables investigations of obscured AGN, multi-phase outflows, ionizing properties, and the role of environment in galaxy evolution.
#### A Tale of Two Sightlines: Comparison of Hydrocarbon Dust Absorption Bands toward Cygnus OB2-12 and the Galactic Center

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared spectra of hydrocarbon dust absorption bands toward the bright hypergiant Cygnus OB2-12 are compared to published spectra of the Quintuplet Cluster, a sightline to the Galactic center. The Cyg OB2-12 data include a new ground-based 2.86-3.70 microns spectrum and a previously published, but here further analyzed, spectrum of the 5.50-7.34 microns region. Higher spectral resolution data for the Cyg OB2-12 sightline in the 3 micron region allows a detailed comparison of the 3.4 micron aliphatic bands to those observed toward the Quintuplet. Despite differences in interstellar environments along each sightline, strong similarities are observed in the central wavelengths and relative strengths for bands at 3.3, 3.4, 5.85, 6.2, and 6.85 microns. Analysis of these bands, produced by aromatic, aliphatic, olefinic, hydrogenated, and oxygenated components, shows that carbonaceous dust is a significant component of the diffuse interstellar medium, second in abundance only to silicates, and is primarily aromatic in nature. The grains producing these bands likely consist of large aromatic carbon cores with thin aliphatic mantles composed of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (HAC). Laboratory analog spectra reproduce the observed aliphatic absorption bands well, supporting the presence of such mantles. We present evidence that the carriers of both the 3.4 micron aliphatic and the 3.3 micron aromatic bands reside exclusively in the diffuse ISM, and that the 3.3 micron bands observed in the diffuse ISM differ from those seen in dense clouds, implying chemically distinct carriers.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ALMA Total Power CO(1-0) mapping of Stephan's Quintet (SQ), a prototypical compact galaxy group, with a uniform noise level at a spatial scale of ~25 kpc. These observations provide the first complete view of molecular gas across the whole system. Molecular gas is found to spread over a wide area (~120 x 80 kpc), mainly over the two main member galaxies (NGC7318B and 7319), but also in the shocked ridges between these galaxies, the tidal tail, and also in intergalactic regions north of the tail. The total CO(1-0) luminosity is $(2.47\pm0.12)\times10^9~\mathrm{K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2}$, corresponding to a molecular gas mass of $(1.07\pm0.05)\times10^{10}~M_\odot$ assuming the Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor. The global star formation efficiency of SQ is estimated at 0.29-0.70 $\mathrm{Gyr^{-1}}$, comparable to or lower than that of nearby star-forming galaxies. Molecular gas spans a velocity range of ~1300 km/s, which can be divided into three components (low, mid, high). The low- and mid-velocity components, linked to NGC7318B and the ridge, show relatively active star formation, whereas the high-velocity component, associated with NGC7319, shows suppressed star formation. Our mapping reveals molecular gas extending ~100 kpc in projection along the inner tail and north of it, containing $(1.64\pm0.08)\times10^9~M_\odot$ (15% of total) with low velocity dispersion (~20 km/s) and ongoing star formation. While previous studies suggested in situ molecular gas formation in the tail, our data suggest an additional contribution from gas stripped from NGC7319.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars play a critical role in the evolution of galaxies, but their formation remains poorly understood. One challenge is accurate measurement of the physical properties of massive protostars, such as current stellar mass, envelope mass, outflow cavity properties, and system orientation. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is widely-used to test models against observations. The far-infrared SED traces cold dust in envelopes, while the near- and mid-infrared (MIR) probes emission from outflow cavities and/or the inner envelope. However, SED fitting has degeneracy limiting its ability to yield accurate measurements of protostellar properties. Here, we develop image profile (IMPRO) fitting as a method to improve the characterization of protostars. We utilize brightness distributions from multi-wavelength MIR images of massive protostars taken by SOFIA/FORCAST as part of the SOFIA Massive Star Formation (SOMA) survey to constrain protostellar properties via comparison to a grid of radiative transfer models. We develop a fitting pipeline to extract information along the outflow axis, which is then combined with the SED fitting to yield improved constraints on protostellar properties. We apply the IMPRO fitting method on the nearby massive protostar Cepheus A, finding that its properties become more tightly constrained compared to SED fitting, especially in the inclination of the source. However, for the more distant G35.20-0.74N, we find that the spatial resolution of SOFIA/FORCAST limits the utility of this combined fitting pipeline. However, higher resolution MIR observations, e.g., with JWST, are expected to greatly expand the applicability of this fitting technique to protostars across the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. A significant fraction (~30%) of massive stars in our Galaxy are moving supersonically through the interstellar medium, which strongly governs their location at the time they end their lives, e.g. die as a supernova and give birth to a supernova remnant (SNR). These dead stellar environments accelerate particles, emitting by non-thermal mechanisms up to the TeV range, and they are considered as a major contributor to the very-high-energy band of the local cosmic-ray spectrum. Aims. This study investigates the effect of the runaway motion of supernova progenitors on the spatial distribution of SNRs in the Milky Way and how this influences the deduced properties of the population. Methods. We construct Galactic populations of SNRs by Monte Carlo simulation, taking into account the bulk motion and the evolution history of their progenitor stars once ejected from their parent clusters. The gamma-ray domain emission of each population is then calculated, to be compared with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) Galactic Plane Survey. Results. We find that including the runaway motion of supernova progenitors strongly modifies the detectability of the simulated emission of their remnants in the very-high-energy band. Particularly, our best fit model using a Reid Milky Way model for core-collapse supernova progenitors requires 33% of massive runaway stars, which is close to the known fraction of runaway high-mass stars, to be in accordance with the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey data. Conclusions. Our results show that the runaway nature of supernova progenitors must be taken into account in the study of the Galactic population of SNRs within the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey and the forthcoming Galactic Plane Survey of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, as it is a governing factor of the detectability of non-thermal emission of their subsequent SNRs.

 - **Abstract**
 Two main models coexist for the environment in which stars form. The clustered model stipulates that the bulk of star formation occurs within dense embedded clusters, but only a minority of them survive the residual gas expulsion phase caused by massive stellar feedback unbinding the clusters. On the other hand, the hierarchical model predicts that star formation happens at a range of scales and densities, where open clusters (OCs) only emerge from the densest regions. We aim to exploit a recent catalog of compact OCs, corrected for completeness, to obtain an updated estimation of the surface density star formation rate within OCs ($\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$), which we compare with recent estimates of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ to determine which model is more likely. We have applied two methods. The first one consisted of integrating over the power law that was fit for the mass function of the youngest OCs using a MC sampling. The second one consisted of counting the total compact mass within these youngest OCs within 1 kpc, so that the result could be directly compared with local values of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$. We estimated new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values between $736^{+159}_{-176}$ and $875^{+34}_{-35}$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, depending on the methodology. These results are significantly higher than previous $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ estimates, which we attribute to the incompleteness of past catalogs, and are consistent with the majority ($\geq$ 50 \%) or even the vast majority ($\geq$ 80 \%) of the star formation occurring in initially compact clusters, through comparisons with $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ from the recent literature. Our new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values are consistent with clustered formation being the most dominant mode of star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are short-lived extra-galactic X-ray sources. Recent progress through multi-wavelength follow-up of Einstein Probe discovered FXTs has shown that several are related to collapsars, which can also produce gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this paper we investigate the nature of the FXT EP250207b. The VLT/MUSE spectra of a nearby (15.9 kpc in projection) lenticular galaxy reveal no signs of recent star formation. If this galaxy is indeed the host, EP250207b lies at a redshift of z=0.082, implying a peak observed absolute magnitude for the optical counterpart of M_r=-14.5. At the time when supernovae (SNe) would peak, it is substantially fainter than all SN types. These results are inconsistent with a collapsar origin for EP250207b. The properties favour a binary compact object merger driven origin. The X-ray, optical and radio observations are compared with predictions of several types of extra-galactic transients, including afterglow and kilonova models. The data can be fit with a slightly off-axis viewing angle afterglow. However, the late-time (~30 day) optical/NIR counterpart is too bright for the afterglow and also for conventional kilonova models. This could be remedied if that late emission is due to a globular cluster or the core of a (tidally disrupted) dwarf galaxy. If confirmed, this would be the first case where the multi-wavelength properties of an FXT are found to be consistent with a compact object merger origin, increasing the parallels between FXTs and GRBs. We finally discuss if the source could originate in a higher redshift host galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the cold atomic hydrogen gas (HI) within cosmic filaments has the potential to pin down the relationship between the low density gas in the cosmic web and how the galaxies that lie within it grow using this material. We report the discovery of a cosmic filament using 14 HI-selected galaxies that form a very thin elongated structure of 1.7 Mpc. These galaxies are embedded within a much larger cosmic web filament, traced by optical galaxies, that spans at least $\sim 15$~Mpc. We find that the spin axes of the HI galaxies are significantly more strongly aligned with the cosmic web filament ($\langle\lvert \cos \psi \rvert\rangle = 0.64 \pm 0.05$) than cosmological simulations predict, with the optically-selected galaxies showing alignment to a lesser degree ($\langle\lvert \cos \psi \rvert\rangle = 0.55 \pm 0.05$). This structure demonstrates that within the cosmic filament, the angular momentum of galaxies is closely connected to the large-scale filamentary structure. We also find strong evidence that the galaxies are orbiting around the spine of the filament, making this one of the largest rotating structures discovered thus far, and from which we can infer that there is transfer of angular momentum from the filament to the individual galaxies. The abundance of HI galaxies along the filament and the low dynamical temperature of the galaxies within the filament indicates that this filament is at an early evolutionary stage where the imprint of cosmic matter flow on galaxies has been preserved over cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation governs galaxy evolution, shaping stellar mass assembly and gas consumption across cosmic time. The Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, linking star formation rate (SFR) and gas surface densities, is fundamental to understand star formation regulation, yet remains poorly constrained at $z > 2$ due to observational limitations and uncertainties in locally calibrated gas tracers. The [CII] $158 {\rm \mu m}$ line has recently emerged as a key probe of the cold ISM and star formation in the early Universe. We investigate whether the resolved [CII]-SFR and KS relations established at low redshift remain valid at $4 < z < 6$ by analysing 13 main-sequence galaxies from the ALPINE and CRISTAL surveys, using multi-wavelength data (HST, JWST, ALMA) at $\sim2$ kpc resolution. We perform pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling with CIGALE on resolution-homogenised images. We develop a statistical framework to fit the [CII]-SFR relation that accounts for pixel covariance and compare our results to classical fitting methods. We test two [CII]-to-gas conversion prescriptions to assess their impact on inferred gas surface densities and depletion times. We find a resolved [CII]-SFR relation with a slope of $0.87 \pm 0.15$ and intrinsic scatter of $0.19 \pm 0.03$ dex, which is shallower and tighter than previous studies at $z\sim5$. The resolved KS relation is highly sensitive to the [CII]-to-gas conversion factor: using a fixed global $\alpha_{\rm [CII]}$ yields depletion times of $0.5$-$1$ Gyr, while a surface brightness-dependent $W_{\rm [CII]}$, places some galaxies with high gas density in the starburst regime ($<0.1$ Gyr). Future inputs from both simulations and observations are required to better understand how the [CII]-to-gas conversion factor depends on local ISM properties. We need to break this fundamental limit to properly study the KS relation at $z\gtrsim4$.
