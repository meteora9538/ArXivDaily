 - **Abstract**
 The Earth possesses many environmental extremes that mimic conditions on extraterrestrial worlds. The stratosphere at 30-40 km altitude closely resembles the surface of Mars in terms of pressure, temperature, and radiation levels (UV, proton, and Galactic cosmic rays). While microbial life in the troposphere is well documented, the true upper limit of Earth's biosphere remains unclear. The stratosphere offers a promising environment to explore microbial survival in such extreme conditions. Despite its significance to astrobiology, this region remains largely unexplored due to difficulties in access and avoiding contamination. To address this, we have developed SAMPLE (Stratospheric Altitude Microbiology Probe for Life Existence), a balloon-borne payload designed to collect dust samples from the stratosphere and return them in conditions suitable for lab analysis. The entire system is novel and designed in-house, with weight- and stress-optimized components. The main payload includes three pre-sterilized sampling trays and a controller that determines altitude and governs tray operation. One tray will remain closed during flight (airborne control) and another on the ground (cleanroom control) to monitor contamination. Additional systems include environmental sensors, GPS trackers, cameras, and a Flight Termination Unit (FTU) to end the mission once sampling is complete. A parachute ensures the safe recovery of the payload. Upon retrieving the payload, the sampling trays (including controls) will be sent to a suitable laboratory where the samples will be examined for the presence and nature of collected material.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed kinematic study of a sample of 32 massive ($9.5\leqslant\log(M_*/{\rm M_{\odot}})\leqslant10.9$) main-sequence star-forming galaxies (MS SFGs) at $4<z<6$ from the ALMA-CRISTAL program. The data consist of deep (up to 15hr observing time per target), high-resolution ($\sim1$kpc) ALMA observations of the [CII]158$\mu$m line emission. This data set enables the first systematic kpc-scale characterisation of the kinematics nature of typical massive SFGs at these epochs. We find that $\sim50\%$ of the sample are disk-like, with a number of galaxies located in systems of multiple components. Kinematic modelling reveals these main sequence disks exhibit high-velocity dispersions ($\sigma_0$), with a median disk velocity dispersion of $\sim70{\rm kms^{-1}}$ and $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma_0\sim2$, and consistent with dominant gravity driving. The elevated disk dispersions are in line with the predicted evolution based on Toomre theory and the extrapolated trends from $z\sim0$-$2.5$ MS star-forming disks. The inferred dark matter (DM) mass fraction within the effective radius $f_{\rm DM}(<R_{\rm e})$ for the disk systems decreases with the central baryonic mass surface density, and is consistent with the trend reported by kinematic studies at $z\lesssim3$; roughly half the disks have $f_{\rm DM}(<R_{\rm e})\lesssim30\%$. The CRISTAL sample of massive MS SFGs provides a reference of the kinematics of a representative population and extends the view onto typical galaxies beyond previous kpc-scale studies at $z\lesssim3$.

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) have long been recognized as key probes of early black hole growth and galaxy evolution. However, modeling this population remains difficult due to the wide range of luminosities and black hole masses involved, and the high computational costs of capturing the hydrodynamic response of gas and evolving radiation fields on-the-fly. In this study, we present a new suite of simulations based on the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation framework, enhanced with on-the-fly radiative transfer, to examine AGN at high redshift (z > 5) in a protocluster environment extracted from the MillenniumTNG simulation. We focus on the co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies, as well as the radiative impact on surrounding intergalactic gas. The model predicts that black holes form in overdense regions and lie below the local black hole-stellar mass relation, with stellar mass assembly preceding significant black hole accretion. Ionizing photons are primarily produced by stars, which shape the morphology of ionized regions and drive reionization. Given the restrictive black hole growth in the original IllustrisTNG model, we reduce the radiative efficiency from 0.2 to 0.1, resulting in higher accretion rates for massive black holes, more bursty growth, and earlier AGN-driven quenching. However, the resulting AGN remain significantly fainter than observed high-redshift quasars. As such, to incorporate this missing population, we introduce a quasar boosted model, in which we artificially boost the AGN luminosity. This results in strong effects on the surrounding gas, most notably a proximity effect, and large contributions to He ionization.
#### Stephenson 2 DFK 52: Discovery of an exotic red supergiant in the massive stellar cluster RSGC2

 - **Abstract**
 Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations at 1.3mm have recently revealed surprising complexity in the circumstellar environment of DFK 52, a red supergiant (RSG) located in the Stephenson 2 massive open cluster. We provide an initial characterisation of the star's mass-loss properties by studying its circumstellar emission in continuum, $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and SiO rotational lines. We find that DFK 52 is surrounded by an extremely large outflow (up to 50,000 au in radius) that shows complex morphologies in both its molecular and dust emission. The size of the circumstellar medium is unprecedented, even when compared with other known extreme RSGs, and its lower luminosity indicates that its mass ejection mechanism may be unique among this population. The molecular emission can be partially reproduced by a two-component model consisting of a fast (27 km/s) detached equatorial component with $M{\sim}0.05$ $M_{\odot}$ and a slow (10 km/s) spherical envelope with $\dot{M}\sim3\times10^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. This suggests that DFK 52 underwent a dramatic mass-loss event $\sim$4000 years ago, but has since transitioned into having a slower more symmetric mass loss. We conservatively estimate a total mass of $0.1-1$ $M_{\odot}$ in the complex extended regions of the outflow. The uncertain nature of the dramatic mass loss warrants extensive follow-up of this likely supernova progenitor.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical plasmas in relativistic spacetimes, such as black hole accretion flows, are often weakly collisional and require kinetic modeling to capture non-local transport and particle acceleration. However, the extreme scale separation between microscopic and macroscopic processes limits the feasibility of fully kinetic simulations. A covariant guiding center formalism has recently been derived to address this challenge in curved spacetimes. We present a new hybrid numerical algorithm based on this formalism, which evolves the trajectories of charged particles over macroscopic timescales in GRMHD backgrounds. To address numerical instabilities in the equations of motion, we develop a semi-implicit integrator that ensures stable evolution in strong-field environments. We apply our method to GRMHD simulations of black hole accretion flows, demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency across a range of physical conditions.
#### CLASSY XIV: Nitrogen Enrichment Shaped by Gas Density and Feedback

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the chemical evolution of N/O using a sample of 45 local star-forming galaxies (SFGs) from the CLASSY survey. This sample spans a wide range of galaxy properties, with robust determinations of nitrogen and oxygen abundances via the direct-$T_{\rm e}$ method. We explore how N/O relates to density structure, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), stellar age, compactness, and gas kinematics. In addition, we compare our results with those of galaxies at $z =2-10$ where N/O ratios were derived from optical or UV nitrogen lines, aiming to identify chemical enrichment pathways across cosmic time. Our analysis shows that the N/O-O/H relation in CLASSY galaxies aligns with the trends seen in local galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, and that galaxies at $z = 2-6$ exhibit similar N/O values, indicating no significant redshift evolution in N/O. We identify a significant correlation between electron density $n_{\rm e}$([S II]) and N/O, suggesting that density structure contributes to the scatter in the N/O-O/H relation. The CLASSY galaxies with high SFRs or compact star formation show elevated N/O, though no strong correlation with stellar mass is found. We also find that high-velocity outflows (v$_{out}$ > 350 km/s) and low mass-loading factors are linked to elevated N/O, indicating that feedback plays a significant role. These results highlight the importance of density, star formation, and feedback from young stellar populations in shaping N/O enrichment and provide key insights for interpreting high-$z$ galaxies observed with JWST.
#### Kinematics of Circumgalactic O VI Gas and Disk Rotation of $z\approx0.2$ Star-forming Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Quasar sightline observations reveal that low-ionization-state gas corotates with the galaxy disk and often at sub-centrifugal velocities, suggesting that the gas is spiraling towards the galaxy disk. However, while observations ubiquitously detect O VI absorption around low-redshift, $\sim L^*$ star-forming galaxies, the relationship between O VI and the galaxy disk, especially the kinematics, is not well-established. This work focuses on the O VI kinematics and its comparison with that of the low ions and galactic disk rotation. We present observations of 18 pairs of quasars and $z\approx0.2$ star-forming galaxies. All quasar sightlines intersect the circumgalactic medium (CGM) within 45$^\circ$ from the galaxy major axes. We show that while individual O VI velocity components do not correlate with disk rotation, the bulk of O VI gas in individual sightlines rarely counter-rotates. We then match O VI velocity components with those of low ions by minimizing the difference of their velocity centroids. The O VI velocity components with successful low-ion matches are typically found at small sightline impact parameters and are more likely to corotate with the disk. We suggest that the low-ion-matched O VI velocity components trace the gas co-spatial with the low ions near the extended disk plane in the inner CGM, whereas those without low-ion matches represent the gas at large 3D radii. While the gas at large radii is theoretically expected to kinematically correlate with the disk angular momentum, this correlation is expected to be weaker due to the higher turbulent to mean rotation velocity ration at large radii, consistent with our results.

 - **Abstract**
 The exoALMA program gave an unprecedented view of the complex kinematics of protoplanetary disks, revealing diverse structures that remain poorly understood. We show that moderate disk warps ($\sim 0.5-2^\circ$) can naturally explain many of the observed large-scale velocity features with azimuthal wavenumber $m = 1$. Using a simple model, we interpret line-of-sight velocity variations as changes in the projected Keplerian rotation caused by warping of the disk. While not a unique explanation, this interpretation aligns with growing observational evidence that warps are common. We demonstrate that such warps can also produce spiral structures in scattered light and CO brightness temperature, with $\sim 10$ K variations in MWC 758. Within the exoALMA sample, warp properties correlate with stellar accretion rates, suggesting a link between the inner disc and outer disc kinematics. If warps cause large-scale kinematic structure, this has far reaching implications for turbulence, angular momentum transport, and planet formation.
#### Why Wide Jupiter-Mass Binary-Objects Cannot Form

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of $N_{\rm pp} = 40$ Jupiter-mass binary objects (JuMBOs) alongside $N_{\rm p} = 500$ free-floating Jupiter-mass objects (JMOs) in the Trapezium cluster's central portion raises questions about their origin \cite{2023arXiv231001231P}. \citet{2024NatAs...8..756W} argue that the rate at which two planets orbiting the same star are stripped by a close encounter can explain about half the observed JuMBOs in the Trapezium cluster. Although, their cross-section calculations agree with our own \citep{2024ScPA....3....1P}, one cannot extrapolate their results into clustered environments because it ignores the dissociation of JuMBOs due to subsequent encounters in the clustered environment. The inability of forming JuMBOs via the proposed scenario either calls for another formation mechanism, or the observed JuMBOs require thorough confirmation.
#### Identifying a protocluster formation at z $\sim$ 4.5 in the COSMOS field: an extension of Taralay protocluster, traced by Ly-alpha emitters surrounding a submm galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a large-scale structure containing multiple overdensities at $z= 4.54 \pm 0.03$ in the COSMOS field, with the most prominent one likely infalling towards the recently identified Taralay protocluster. We use combined wide-band and narrow-band optical photometry to identify Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) within a 21 cMpc radius from the submm source J1000+0234, at $z= 4.54$, to identify typical star-forming galaxies that may trace an underlying structure. Our approach selects line emitters as narrow-band excess objects and we use the COSMOS2020 photometric redshift catalog to eliminate potential low-redshift interlopers whose line emission (e.g. [OIII] at $z\sim 0.3$) might be responsible for the observed excess in the narrow band. In comparison with the LAE density in the field, our results point to a mean LAE number overdensity of $\bar\delta = 3$ spanning a region of $27 \times 20 \times 36$ cMpc$^3$, probably evolving into a moderate-mass cluster ($3 - 10 \times 10^{14} \, M_\odot$) at $z\sim 0$. This work supports the idea that submm sources, although offset from the major overdensity peaks, serve as traces of moderately massive, potentially infalling structures.

 - **Abstract**
 The phenomenon of magnetic braking is one of the significant physical effects of the magnetic field in rotating molecular clouds. The physical characteristics of the core can affect on the core rotation rate. and one of the important parameter is the core density structure. According to observation, by regarding the power-law density distribution, $r^{-p}$, for molecular cloud cores, using smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation, the results show that the increasing of density steepness (i.e., larger $p$) leads to the intensity of the toroidal components of the magnetic field and as a result larger $B_{\phi}$-components lead to more transfer of angular momentum to the outward. Thus, results show that the magnetic braking being stronger with increasing density slope in non-uniform molecular core. For example, the rotation of the system can approximately decrease by fifty percent from $p=0.2$ to $p=1.8$ for a non-uniform system.
#### Unveiling the galactic baryon cycle process by an empirical model

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12209

 - **Abstract**
 We propose an empirical model to describe and constrain the baryon cycle process during galaxy evolution. This model utilizes the evolution of star formation rate, derived from the stellar mass-halo mass relations (SHMRs) across different redshifts, and the cold gas content, derived from the NeutralUniverseMachine model, to constrain gas accretion and recycle of gas outflow in the model galaxy. Additionally, through detailed modeling of each cycle process, particularly the recycling process, and utilizing the gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at $z=0$ as a constraint, our model establishes a relation between the recycle fraction and halo mass. It is found that the fraction of gas recycled from the outflow is a function of halo mass, with a value of $25\%$ in galaxies with halo mass $\sim10^{10.4}M_{\rm \odot}$, increasing to $75\%$ in halos with mass $\sim 10^{12}M_{\rm \odot}$. We also find that the mass loading factor from the FIRE-2 simulation matches well with the constraints from both observational data and our model. Furthermore, using the gas content and metallicity of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) obtained from hydrodynamical simulations as constraints, our model predicts that on average $70\%$ of universal baryon accretion is accreted to the halo and $80\%$ of the non-recycled gas in the outflow has escaped from the galaxy, entering the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, we note that future observational data are needed to finally constrain the mass and metal exchange between the CGM and the IGM.
#### The Interstellar Medium in I Zw 18 seen with JWST/MIRI: III. Spatially Resolved Three Ionization State Oxygen Abundance

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of the nearby extremely metal-poor galaxy I Zw 18 using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) and the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) Integral Field Spectrographs (IFS). From optical and mid-IR oxygen emission lines, we measured direct-method abundances for three ionic states of oxygen, including O$^{3+}$/H$^+$. In contrast to previous studies of I Zw 18, the high spatial resolution afforded by KCWI and MIRI/MRS revealed chemical inhomogeneities on 60 pc scales in the form of metal-poor pockets and metal-enriched gas. These are located outside I Zw 18's star-forming complexes having possibly been dispersed beyond these regions via stellar feedback effects. We found that metallicities derived using a single low-ionization density tracer, and T$_{\rm e}$([O II]) derived from a temperature relationship commonly used in high-$z$ galaxy studies, exhibited the largest scatter and underestimated the metallicity compared to those derived using multi-ion densities and estimated T$_{\rm e}$([N II]). Finally, we compared O$^{3+}$/H$^+$ abundances from a theoretical ionization correction factor (ICF) against observed values and found that the oxygen ICF underestimates the O$^{3+}$/H$^+$ abundance by a factor of 2, indicating that either additional ionizing sources are needed or standard stellar population models are unable to produce the requisite ionizing flux.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Dust is a fundamental component of the interstellar medium (ISM) and plays a critical role in galaxy evolution. Dust grains influence the ISM by cooling the gas, altering its chemistry, and absorbing stellar radiation, re-emitting it at longer wavelengths in the far-infrared (FIR) and sub-millimeter regimes. The cold dust component, which dominates the dust mass, is primarily heated by stellar radiation, including both young, massive stars and the diffuse emission from older stars. Understanding dust heating is essential to trace the connection between stellar populations and their environments. Aims. We aim to identify the dominant heating mechanisms of the cold dust in typical nearby spiral galaxies and explore the contributions of young and evolved stars to dust heating. Methods. Using 18 large, face-on spiral galaxies from the DustPedia project, we apply two complementary approaches: (1) correlation analysis between dust temperature (T_dust), SFR surface density (Sigma_SFR), and stellar mass surface density (Sigma_Mstar); and (2) study of the relationship between T_dust and dust mass surface density (Sigma_dust). Results. T_dust peaks at ~24 K in galaxy centers and drops to ~15 K at large radii. Galaxies with and without AGNs show similar T_dust profiles. For ~72% of the sample, both methods agree on the dominant heating source. Overall, we find that both young and evolved stars contribute to dust heating, with their relative roles varying between galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first application of marked angular power spectra to weak lensing data, using maps from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 1 (HSC-Y1) survey. Marked convergence fields, constructed by weighting the convergence field with non-linear functions of its smoothed version, are designed to encode higher-order information while remaining computationally tractable. Using simulations tailored to the HSC-Y1 data, we test three mark functions that up- or down-weight different density environments. Our results show that combining multiple types of marked auto- and cross-spectra improves constraints on the clustering amplitude parameter $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$ by $\approx$43\% compared to standard two-point power spectra. When applied to the HSC-Y1 data, this translates into a constraint on $S_8 = 0.807\pm 0.024$. We assess the sensitivity of the marked power spectra to systematics, including baryonic effects, intrinsic alignment, photometric redshifts, and multiplicative shear bias. These results demonstrate the promise of marked statistics as a practical and powerful tool for extracting non-Gaussian information from weak lensing surveys.
#### The impact of the transport of chemicals and electronic screening on helioseismic and neutrino observations in solar models

 - **Abstract**
 The transport of chemical elements in stellar interiors is one of the greatest sources of uncertainties of solar and stellar modelling. The Sun, with its exquisite spectroscopic, helioseismic and neutrino observations, offers a prime environment to test the prescriptions used for both microscopic and macroscopic transport processes. We study in detail the impact of various formalisms for atomic diffusion on helioseismic constraints in both CLES (Scuflaire et al., 2008a) and Cesam2k2 (Morel and Lebreton 2008; Marques et al. 2013; Deal et al. 2018) models and compare both codes in detail. Moreover, due to the inability of standard models using microscopic diffusion to reproduce light element depletion in the Sun (Li, Be), another efficient process must be included to reproduce these constraints (rotation-induced: Eggenberger et al. 2022, overshooting -- or penetrative convection -- below the convective envelope: Thévenin et al. 2017, or ad hoc turbulence: Lebreton and Maeder 1987; Richer, Michaud, and Turcotte 2000). However, introducing such an extra mixing leads to issues with the CNO neutrino fluxes (see Buldgen et al. 2023), which seem to be systematically lower than the Borexino observations (Appel et al., 2022. Another key aspect to consider when reconciling models with neutrino fluxes is the impact of electronic screening (Mussack and Däppen, 2011).
