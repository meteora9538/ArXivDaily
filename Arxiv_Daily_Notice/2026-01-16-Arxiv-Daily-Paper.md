#### Breathless BEARS: [O$_{\rm \,III}$] 88$μ$m Emission of Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies at $z = 3-4$

 - **Abstract**
 We present [O$_{\rm \,III}$] 88$\mu$m observations towards four ${\it Herschel}$-selected dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs; log$_{10}$ $\mu$L$_{\rm IR}$/L$_{\odot}$ = 13.5 - 14 at $z = 2.9 - 4$) using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) in Bands 9 and 10. We detect [O$_{\rm \,III}$] emission in all four targets at >3$\sigma$, finding line luminosity ratios ($L_{\rm [O_{\rm \,III}]}$ / L$_{\rm IR}$ = 10$^{-4.2}$ to 10$^{-3}$) similar to local spiral galaxies, and an order of magnitude lower when compared with local dwarf galaxies as well as high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies. Using the short-wavelength capabilities of the ACA, these observations bridge the populations of galaxies with [O$_{\rm \,III}$] emission at low redshift from space missions and at high redshift from ground-based studies. The difference in [O$_{\rm \,III}$] emission between these DSFGs and other high-redshift galaxies reflects their more evolved stellar populations (> 10 Myr), larger dust reservoirs (M$_{\rm dust}$ $\sim$ 10$^{9 - 11}$ M$_{\odot}$), metal-rich interstellar medium ($Z \sim 0.5 - 2$ Z$_{\odot}$), and likely weaker ionization radiation fields. Ancillary [C$_{\rm \,II}$] emission on two targets provide $L_{[{\rm O}_{\rm \,III}]} / L_{[{\rm C}_{\rm \,II}]}$ ratios at 0.3 - 0.9, suggesting that ionized gas represents a smaller fraction of the total gas reservoir in DSFGs, consistent with theoretical models of DSFGs as transitional systems between gas-rich, turbulent disks and more evolved, gas-poor galaxies. Expanding samples of DSFGs with [O$_{\rm \,III}$] emission will be key to place this heterogeneous, poorly-understood galactic phase in its astrophysical context.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) are among the most massive galaxies at any epoch, and lack ongoing star formation. As systems hosting most of the baryonic mass in the local Universe, they preserve imprints of the quenching mechanisms in the early Universe. We exploited the large BOSS and DESI spectroscopic datasets to perform the first homogeneous and continuous mapping of the evolution of stellar population properties of a complete sample of the most massive LRGs ($\log (M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot})> 11.5$) at 0.15 < z < 0.8. By consistently fitting the same spectral indices at all redshifts, we measured trends of [Fe/H], [alpha/Fe], and light-weighted age as a function of redshift. These galaxies exhibit a passive light-weighted age evolution and flat [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] trends towards lower redshift, indicating genuinely passive evolution. These trends are robust against the choice of stellar population models and analysis assumptions, and they support the predictions from IllustrisTNG, which predict negligible chemical evolution for the most massive quenched systems at z < 0.8. Our results suggest that, despite nearly 5 Gyr of cosmic time and a 3-4x increase in number density, the stellar population properties of massive quiescent galaxies remain essentially unchanged since z ~ 0.8. This shows a negligible progenitor bias below z ~ 0.8, and a genuinely passive evolution. Newly added systems after $z \sim 0.8$ were already largely quenched and chemically mature, while subsequent evolution was dominated by dry mergers without altering the bulk of the stellar populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Cloud-cloud collisions are expected to trigger star formation by compressing gas into dense, gravitationally unstable regions. However, the role of magnetic fields in this process is unclear. We use SPH to model head-on collisions between two uniform density clouds, each with mass $500 \,$M$_{\odot}$, initial radius 2 pc, and embedded in a uniform magnetic field parallel to the collision velocity. As in the nonmagnetic case, the resulting shock-compressed layer fragments into a network of filaments. If the collision is sufficiently slow, the filaments are dragged into radial orientations by non-homologous gravitational contraction, resulting in a $\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphology, which spawns a centrally concentrated monolithic cluster with a broad mass function shaped by competitive accretion and dynamical ejections. If the collision is faster, a $\textit{Spiders Web}$ of intersecting filaments forms, and star-systems condense out in small subclusters, often at the filament intersections; due to their smaller mass reservoirs, and the lower probability of dynamical ejection, the mass function of star-systems formed in these subclusters is narrower. Magnetic fields affect this dichotomy quantitatively by delaying collapse and fragmentation. As a result, the velocity threshold separating $\textit{Hub Filament}$ and $\textit{Spiders Web}$ morphologies is shifted upward in magnetised runs, thereby enlarging the parameter space in which $\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies form, and enhancing the likelihood of producing centrally concentrated clusters. Consequently, magnetic fields regulate both the morphology and timing of star formation in cloud-cloud collisions: they broaden filaments, delay the onset of star formation, and promote the formation of $\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies, monolithic clusters and high-mass star-systems.
#### HR-GO II: chemical abundances of low-$E$ retrograde dynamically-tagged-groups: Revealing Thamnos as a very metal-poor substructure

 - **Abstract**
 Milky Way halo substructures identified in dynamical space are known to suffer from contamination from the Milky Way in-situ stars, which makes their accreted origins uncertain. We present detailed chemical abundances of 35 stars belonging to two sets of dynamically tagged groups, Rg8 and Rg9, to investigate their accreted nature. Both groups are composed of stars with low orbital energy and very retrograde orbits. We find that Rg8 and Rg9 are chemically indistinguishable across all elements, from C to Eu, strongly indicating that they belong to the same structure. The iron-abundance distribution of this low-$E$ retrograde group has a prominent peak at [Fe/H] $\approx-2.1$, revealing that its main population is very metal-poor, and a secondary peak at [Fe/H] $\approx-1.5$, very likely due to contamination from Milky Way in-situ stars. These groups also heavily overlap with the Thamnos substructure in dynamical space, and we thus use them to investigate the chemical properties of Thamnos. The dominant, low-metallicity population provides strong evidence for the ex-situ origin of Thamnos, as well as its very metal-poor nature. We do not see any evidence of an $\alpha$ knee in our sample, which is consistent with previous studies. Comparison with the Cetus-Palca stream in the chemical space shows similar abundance distributions, and thus it suggests that the Thamnos progenitor dwarf galaxy had a truncated star formation history due to its early merger with the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous infrared galaxies are key sites of obscured stellar mass assembly at z > 0.5. Their star formation rates (SFRs) are often estimated using the luminosities of the 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features, or those of the [Ne II] and [Ne III] fine-structure lines, as they are minimally affected by obscuration. It is uncertain whether the calibration of these features as SFR tracers depends on the starburst bolometric luminosity or the level of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity. We here investigate the relationship between the luminosities of PAH and Neon lines with star formation rate for highly luminous objects using radiative transfer modeling and archival observations of 42 local Ultraluminous (>= 10^12 L_sun) Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs). We find that PAH and [Ne II] features arise mainly in star-forming regions, with small contributions from the AGN or host, but that the [Ne III] line has a mixed contribution from both star formation and AGN activity. We present relations between L_PAH and L_NeII, and both starburst luminosity and SFR. We find relations for lower luminosity (L_IR ~= 10^10-10^12 L_sun) systems underestimate the SFRs in local ULIRGs by up to ~1 dex. The 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron PAH features, and the [Ne II] line, are thus good tracers of SFR in ULIRGs. We do not find that a more luminous AGN affects the relationship between SFR and PAH or Neon luminosity, but that it can make PAH emission harder to discern. Our results and derived relations are relevant to studies of star-forming and composite galaxies at z < 3 with the James Webb Space Telescope.
#### Are Recently Quenched Ellipticals Truly Isolated Centrals?

 - **Abstract**
 Recently Quenched Ellipticals (RQEs) provide a valuable test case for disentangling intrinsic and environmental quenching, particularly because they are commonly classified as isolated central galaxies in low-mass halos. However, central/satellite assignments and isolation labels can vary across group catalogs, and such misclassifications can strongly bias physical interpretations. We present a uniform, physically motivated reassessment of the environments of 155 RQEs previously identified as centrals in an SDSS-based group catalog. We construct value-added neighbor catalogs via KD-tree searches and apply consistent thresholds in projected separation and line-of-sight velocity to (i) verify centrality, (ii) quantify isolation using a mass-ratio-based companion criterion, and (iii) identify potential pseudo-centrals via proximity to massive clusters. We find that 132/155 (85.2\%) RQEs remain true centrals, while 23/155 (14.8\%) are better interpreted as misidentified centrals with a more massive neighbor within $R_{\rm proj}\leq0.8$~Mpc and $\Delta V\leq250$~km~s$^{-1}$. Among the true centrals, 110/132 (83.3\%) satisfy our isolation criterion, and only one system meets our pseudo-central definition, indicating that direct cluster-scale preprocessing is rare for RQE centrals. Using projected number density and surface stellar mass density, we show that misidentified and non-isolated systems occupy systematically denser regimes than isolated true centrals. These results imply that while most RQEs ($\sim$71\%) are consistent with predominantly internal quenching in genuinely isolated centrals, a non-negligible minority ($\sim$29\%) likely experienced environmentally influenced pathways at group scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Although there have now been hundreds of transient gravitational-wave detections of merging compact stars by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detector network, no continuous-wave (CW) signals have yet been discovered. To ensure that such signals, expected to be exceedingly weak, can be detected in the ongoing O4 observing run by coherent integration over years, simulated waveforms ('hardware injections') are injected directly into the LIGO data by continuously modulating the positions of the interferometer mirrors so as to mimic nearly sinusoidal signals from fast-spinning galactic neutron stars. A set of 18 such simulated CW sources are injected with signal frequencies spanning much of the LIGO detection band and with varying sky locations. By verifying the successful recovery of the simulated signals, including preservation of absolute phase over as many as 10^{11} signal cycles, we validate our understanding of detector response and end-to-end search pipelines, including data cleaning. Daily and weekly monitoring of the signal reconstruction is meant to catch any unexpected sudden changes in interferometer response, to verify that signal-to-noise ratio increases as expected and to verify that simulated source parameters are recovered correctly. We describe three methods of monitoring: 1) a highly templated matched filter to extract signal amplitude and phase precisely; 2) a frequentist Fstatistic evaluation that marginalizes over amplitude, phase and orientation of the star; and 3) a Bayesian reconstruction of the source parameters together with noise characterization. Results from each method are shown, with emphasis on the new templated method, which yields precise measurement of the critical phase offset parameter and therefore validates understanding of absolute timing delays in the detector response and data stream.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new measurements of galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) from JWST/NIRCam imaging over the redshift range z=4.5-9.7, using photometric catalogs from JADES and public extragalactic fields. Our analysis includes rest-frame UV and B-band LFs, as well as apparent LFs in F090W, F115W, F200W, F356W, and F444W. We present the first constraints on the rest-frame B-band LF at z~7-8 and extend existing measurements at z~5 to M(B) = -18 mag. The B-band LFs evolve more strongly with redshift than UV LFs, though both decline more gradually than predicted by simulations at z>5. No single existing simulation reproduces all observed trends, with discrepancies likely driven by assumptions about binary evolution and stellar population synthesis models. The apparent LFs in F356W and F444W show hints of a bright-end excess at all redshifts, extending to fainter magnitudes at higher redshift. While extreme emission line galaxies may partially account for it, the excess may also indicate a population of moderately red, optically bright sources - potentially dusty star-forming galaxies or obscured AGNs. Finally, we find that rest-frame B-band luminosity correlates more tightly with stellar mass than UV, making it a powerful tracer of mass assembly and reinforcing the diagnostic value of rest-frame optical LFs in uncovering the physical processes that drive early galaxy formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm global signal, a treasure trove of information about the nature of the first luminous sources of the Universe, has traditionally been modelled assuming that these early sources were predominantly star-forming galaxies. However, recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed several AGNs as early as z ~ 10 - 10.4 . In light of this, it is important to investigate the contribution of such AGNs to the 21-cm signal. Assuming that these AGNs are seeded by Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and employing an analytical PBH model, consistent with existing cosmological and astrophysical constraints, we show that these exotic objects can have a significant impact on the redshift evolution of the global signal.

 - **Abstract**
 The bending of radio galaxies in galaxy clusters is expected to be caused by interactions with the local environment. The physical processes responsible for jet bending, and their influence on the polarization properties of radio galaxies, remain poorly understood, leading to the question of whether jet properties in bent radio galaxies differ from those in linear radio galaxies. Using a sample of 24 polarized bent radio galaxies, observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 1--2 GHz, we test for correlation of bending angle with polarization parameters measuring Faraday rotation, intrinsic fractional polarization, and Faraday rotation dispersion, used here as a measure of turbulence along the line of sight. We find no statistically significant correlations. At the spatial resolution of our dataset (3--46 kpc, median 18.4 kpc), our results indicate that we are primarily probing larger-scale intracluster medium effects not related to bending angle. The absence of a statistically significant correlation suggests that bent radio galaxies are reliable probes of intracluster magnetic fields, because their intrinsic properties do not appear to introduce systematic biases into measured polarization parameters. We do detect a preference for source magnetic field vectors to align with the direction of jet bending. Finally, we estimate that the POSSUM and SKA surveys will contain $\gtrsim$300 and $\gtrsim$1000 polarized radio galaxies, respectively, providing large future samples with a range of bending angles and similar redshift distribution and number of beams per source as in our sample, enabling our results to be tested with greater statistical power.
#### Active Galactic Nuclei and STaR fOrmation in Nearby Galaxies (AGNSTRONG). II: Results for Jetted Type-I AGNs with Strong Ionized Gas Outflows

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the correlation between ionized gas outflows, jets, and star formation in a sample of 42 local type-I active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibiting significant [O III] outflows. This study uses both new submillimeter (sub-mm) observations and archival data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Our analysis, which includes a correction for jet emission in the sub-mm bands, fitting spectral energy distribution, and analyzing spectra, enables us to derive star-formation rates (SFRs) through various methods. By comparing radio power and SFRs, we select a sub-sample of jetted AGNs of which radio emission is mostly from the jets. We find that jetted AGNs predominantly lie above the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, suggesting a correlation between jet activity and star formation. By comparing dust extinction, we demonstrate that jetted AGNs do not have more dust which is the fuel of both star formation and AGN activity. Therefore, this correlation is more likely to arise from AGN feedback. We also find that the Eddington ratio does not impact the specific SFRs (sSFRs) of our sample. Additionally, for jetted AGNs, stronger radio emission corresponds to higher sSFRs, suggesting that jet emission may promote star formation, i.e., positive feedback. Our results not only shed light on the feedback mechanisms of AGNs but also underscore the complex interplay between black hole activity and star formation in galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Long Period Transients (LPTs) are a recently identified class of sources characterized by periodic radio bursts lasting seconds to minutes, with flux densities that might reach several tens of Jy. These radio bursts repeat with periodicity from minutes to hours, and they exhibit strong polarization and transient activity periods. To date, about 12 such sources have been identified, which might encompass the same or different physical scenarios. Proposed explanations include binary systems with a white dwarf and a low-mass star companion, slow-spinning magnetars, highly magnetized isolated white dwarfs, and other exotic objects. In a few cases the optical counterpart indeed points toward a white dwarf with a low-mass companion, while in other cases, transient X-ray emission was detected, very common in magnetars. However, despite being able to reproduce partially some of the characteristics of LPTs, all the proposed scenarios find difficulty in explaining the exact physical origin of their bright, highly polarized and periodic radio emission. We review here the state-of-the-art in the observations and interpretation of this puzzling class of radio transients.

 - **Abstract**
 The structure and evolution of close-in exoplanets are shaped by atmospheric loss and migration processes, which give rise to key population features such as the hot Neptune desert, ridge, and savanna - regions of the period-radius space whose boundaries offer critical insights into planetary formation and survival. As part of the KESPRINT collaboration, we selected the TESS transiting planet candidate TOI-3862.01 for radial velocity follow-up to confirm its planetary nature and characterize its mass and bulk properties. This planet candidate is of particular interest due to its position in the middle of the hot Neptune desert, making it a valuable probe for testing theories of planet migration and atmospheric loss. We confirmed the planetary nature and determined the mass of TOI-3862.01 (hereinafter TOI-3862b) by performing a joint fit with both transit and radial velocity data, precisely characterizing the bulk properties of this planet. TOI-3862b is a super-Neptune on a 1.56-day orbit around a Sun-like star with an effective temperature of 5300$\pm$50K. It has a mass of 53.7$_{-2.9}^{+2.8}$ M$_{\oplus}$ and a radius of 5.53$\pm$0.18 R$_{\oplus}$, corresponding to a density of 1.7$\pm$0.2 g/cm^3. This places it among the rare population of hot and dense super-Neptune desert planets. TOI-3862b, residing deep in the hot Neptune desert, represents a rare occurrence in an otherwise sparsely populated region, offering a valuable opportunity to probe the processes that may allow planets to survive in such environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet population synthesis is an integral tool for linking exoplanets to their formation environments. Most planet population synthesis studies have focused on the carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) in gas or solids, yet more insight into planet formation may be afforded by considering a wider suite of elements. Sulfur is one such key element. It has been assumed to be entirely refractory in population synthesis models, restricting it to being a tracer of accreted rocky solids. However, sulfur also has a volatile reservoir dominant at the onset of star and planet formation. We investigate sulfur's wider potential as a formation history tracer by implementing the first multi-phase treatment of S in a planet population synthesis model. We present the planet formation module of \textsc{sponchpop} and its first predicted planet growth tracks and populations. We explore the diversity of planet compositions in terms of their sulfur budget, including both refractory and volatile components, and apply a novel gas-grain conversion of sulfur to study how formation trajectories of giant planets relate to final core and envelope compositions. We show that planets inherit a wide range of core and envelope sulfur content related to accretion history while considering late-stage planetesimal infall, providing a new diagnostic tool for planet formation. The diverse sulfur content of planet cores suggests some rocky planets may be born sulfur-poor, with implications for their geochemistry and habitability. Enhanced sulfur abundances in gas-giant atmospheres can be attributed to formation beyond the H2S iceline, such as the giants in our Solar System.

 - **Abstract**
 A substantial fraction of metal-poor stars in the local Milky Way halo exhibit large overabundances of carbon. These stars, dubbed Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars, provide crucial constraints on the nature of the early universe including the earliest nucleosynthetic events. Whether these stars exist at similar rates in nearby galaxies is a major open question with implications for the environmental dependence of early chemical evolution. Here, we present the discovery of the first five CEMP stars in the Milky Way's largest dwarf companion, the LMC, using SDSS-V spectra from the BOSS instrument. We measure metallicities ranging from [Fe/H] = -2.1 to -3.2 and evolutionary state corrected carbon enhancements of [C/Fe] = +1.2 to +2.4, placing these stars among the most metal-poor and carbon-rich ever identified in the LMC. This discovery demonstrates that CEMP stars do exist in the LMC despite previous null detections, and establishes the foundation for measuring the CEMP occurrence rate in this system. Such measurements will provide critical tests of whether environmental differences affect the formation channels and frequencies of these ancient, carbon-rich stars.

 We present a statistical study on the origins of the UV continuum and narrow/broad emission lines in little red dots (LRDs), a newly discovered class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Leveraging all archived JWST/NIRSpec data, we build a sample of 28 spectroscopically-confirmed LRDs at $5<z_{\rm spec}<7.2$, by requiring broad H$\alpha$ emission, blue UV colors, V-shaped continua, and compact morphologies. We define a control sample of 9 blue, compact, broad-line AGNs without red optical continua (hereafter little blue dots; LBDs), and examine correlations between rest UV and the narrow/broad H$\alpha$ luminosities in these populations. In LRDs, both narrow and broad H$\alpha$ components are tightly correlated with the UV continuum, and the luminosity ratios are consistent with those in young starburst galaxies. In contrast, the UV to broad H$\alpha$ ratios in LBDs closely match local unobscured AGNs and are statistically different from LRDs. The Ly$\alpha$ occurrence rates and strengths do not differ between LRDs and LBDs and are comparable to normal star-forming galaxies. These results are consistent with a scenario where the central BH in LRDs is enshrouded by a dense opaque gas envelope -- in this model, the UV continuum as well as narrow and even broad H$\alpha$ emissions are not powered by AGNs but predominantly by young massive stars surrounding the envelope, while the envelope radiates as a $\sim 5000$ K blackbody. As the envelope dissipates, direct AGN emission can emerge, potentially transforming LRDs into LBDs and marking the end of a short-lived phase of rapid black hole growth.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of active galactic nuclei have revealed a correlation between millimeter luminosity, X-ray luminosity, and mass, suggesting the emission in each of these bands is powered by a common source. Starting with a set of five general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with dynamically important magnetic fields, we perform ray-tracing calculations to produce spectra including synchrotron emission, bremsstrahlung emission, and Compton scattering. Our models with similar Eddington ratios to the objects for which the relationship was inferred naturally reproduce observations without tuning. Our lower Eddington ratio models depart from this relationship, likely attributable to an observational bias against extremely low accretion rates. We find that inverse Compton scattering dominates the production of X-rays over bremsstrahlung radiation in almost all models, and in all models consistent with the observed correlation. We find only a modest spin dependence in this relationship. This study demonstrates that a compact, hot accretion flow with dynamically important magnetic fields can naturally explain observed millimeter and X-ray properties in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. Future work should explore the impacts of non-thermal electron populations, weaker magnetic fields, and radiative cooling.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a four-component high-resolution model of thermal dust emission for microwave and sub-mm frequencies derived from Planck HFI, WHAM and Gaia. The resulting high-resolution model derived here forms the basis for the thermal dust model employed in the Cosmoglobe DR2 reanalysis of COBE-DIRBE. The four dust components are called ``cold dust'', ``hot dust'', ``nearby dust'', and ``Ha correlated dust'', respectively, and trace different physical environments. The spatial distributions of the nearby dust and Ha dust components are defined by the Edenhofer et al. Gaia 3D extinction model and the WHAM survey, respectively, while the hot and cold dust components are fit freely pixel-by-pixel to the Planck HFI data. We use a global parameter grid search coupled to an amplitude map Gibbs sampler to fit this model to Planck HFI data. In agreement with the companion low-resolution analysis, we find that the hot dust component is strongly correlated with the FIRAS Cii map, while the cold dust component is strongly correlated with the HI4PI Hi map. Despite its fewer degrees of freedom per pixel compared to the Planck 2015 legacy dust model, we find that this new model performs competitively in terms of overall residuals, capturing over 98% of the full-sky dust variance for all channels. When fitting a spatially varying 3-parameter MBB model to the new dust model with isotropic SEDs, we find very similar spatial distributions to those of the official Planck analysis, and this new model thus represents an economical decomposition of previously published spatially varying spectral parameter maps. We conclude that this new model represents both a statistically more efficient summary of thermal dust in the microwave and far-infrared regimes and a physically more realistic decomposition of the sky compared to the traditional 3-parameter MBB model.

 - **Abstract**
 The study is devoted to comparing the parameters of the interstellar medium of HII regions in the Kongiu and Groves catalogs for the galaxy NGC 628. The article analyzes the characteristics of star-forming regions, including a comparison of radiation fluxes in the ranges of 7.7 $\mu$m and 21 $\mu$m and in the H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, OIII and CO lines, calculating the kinematic parameters (FWHM) for the lines, and analyzing the spatial distribution of regions for both catalogs. The results of the study showed that the regions from the Groves catalog demonstrate higher line widths compared to the Kongiu catalog. Signs of possible misidentified classification of some regions from the Groves catalog were revealed: there is a possibility that some of them are not HII regions, but shock ionization regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The ongoing Euclid mission aims to measure spectroscopic redshifts for approximately two million galaxies using the H $\alpha$ line emission detected in near-infrared slitless spectroscopic data from the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs). These measurements will reach a flux limit of $5\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ in the redshift range $0.4<z<1.8$, opening the door to numerous investigations involving galaxy evolution, extending well beyond the mission's core objectives. The achieved H $\alpha$ luminosity depth will lead to a sufficiently high sampling, enabling the reconstruction of the large-scale galaxy environment. We assess the quality of the reconstruction of the galaxy cosmic web environment with the expected spectroscopic dataset in EDFs. The analysis is carried out on the Flagship and GAEA galaxy mock catalogues. The quality of the reconstruction is first evaluated using geometrical and topological statistics measured on the cosmic web, namely the length of filaments, the area of walls, the volume of voids, and its connectivity and multiplicity. We then quantify how accurately gradients in galaxy properties with distance from filaments can be recovered. As expected, the small-scale redshift-space distortions, have a strong impact on filament lengths and connectivity, but can be mitigated by compressing galaxy groups before skeleton extraction. The cosmic web reconstruction is biased when relying solely on H $\alpha$ emitters. This limitation can be mitigated by applying stellar mass weighting during the reconstruction. However, this approach introduces non-trivial biases that need to be accounted for when comparing to theoretical predictions. Redshift uncertainties pose the greatest challenge in recovering the expected dependence of galaxy properties, though the well-established stellar mass transverse gradients towards filaments can still be observed.
