 - **Abstract**
 Stars form as molecular clouds fragment into networks of dense cores, filaments, and subclusters. The characteristic spacing of these cores is a key observable imprint of fragmentation physics and is commonly measured using nearest-neighbour (NN) statistics. However, NN separations are derived from projected two-dimensional (2D) positions, while fragmentation occurs in three dimensions (3D). Using spherical and fractal toy models, we show that the standard geometric deprojection factor of $4/\pi\simeq1.27$ is inadequate because projection not only foreshortens separations but also rewires the NN network, while finite angular resolution merges close neighbours and inflates apparent spacings. We quantify these competing biases with Monte Carlo experiments spanning a wide range of morphologies, sample sizes, and effective resolutions. From these we derive an empirical correction factor that depends on both sample size and resolution: for small ($N\lesssim10$) or poorly resolved samples ($\lesssim$10 resolution elements across the field), intrinsic NN spacings exceed projected values by only 20 to 40%, whereas for well-sampled ($N\gtrsim100$), well-resolved data ($\gtrsim$30-50 resolution elements), true 3D separations are typically larger by a factor of $\sim$2. This calibration enables observers to convert measured 2D NN spacings into corresponding 3D estimates, with typical morphology-driven uncertainties of order 30 to 40%, and we demonstrate how it alters inferred fragmentation scales in observed and simulated core populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the early Universe (z > 4) with the James Webb Space Telescope reveal galaxy populations with a wide range of intrinsic luminosities and colors. Bursty star formation histories (SFHs), characterized by short-term fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR), may explain this diversity, but constraining burst timescales and amplitudes in individual galaxies is challenging due to degeneracies and sensitivity limits. We introduce a population-level simulation-based inference framework that recovers the power and timescales of SFR fluctuations by forward-modeling galaxy populations and distributions of rest-UV to rest-optical spectral features sensitive to star formation timescales. We adopt a stochastic SFH model based on a power spectral density formalism spanning 1 Myr-10 Gyr. Using simulated samples of N=500 galaxies at z~4 with typical JWST/NIRSpec uncertainties, we demonstrate that: (i) the power of SFR fluctuations can be measured with sufficient precision to distinguish between simulations (e.g., FIRE-2-like vs. Illustris-like populations at >99% confidence for timescales < 100 Myr); (ii) simultaneously modeling stochastic fluctuations and the recent (t_L < 500 Myr) average SFH slope is essential, as secular trends otherwise mimic burstiness in common diagnostics; (iii) frequent, intense bursts impose an outshining limit, and bias inference toward underestimating burstiness due to the obscuration of long-timescale power; and (iv) the power of SFR fluctuations can be inferred to 95% confidence across all timescales in both smooth and bursty populations. This framework establishes a novel and robust method for placing quantitative constraints on the feedback physics regulating star formation using large, uniformly selected spectroscopic samples.

 - **Abstract**
 The Haro 11 galaxy merger is the closest known Lyman Continuum (LyC) leaker and a strong Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emitter, making it an important analogue of the high-$z$ galaxies that reionised the early Universe. To investigate how Haro 11's properties arise, we perform a radiation hydrodynamics simulation of the merger, and create mock observations of LyC, Ly$\alpha$, and H$\alpha$, from which we compute their luminosities ($L$) and escape fractions ($f_{\rm esc}$). We track these quantities along multiple sightlines as the two progenitor galaxies merge, from the first interaction until the system resembles present-day Haro 11. We find that $L$ and $f_{\rm esc}$ vary by 1-2 orders of magnitude for LyC due to sightline variations. At the two pericentre passages, the total $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ increases by roughly an order of magnitude. Conversely, $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm Ly\alpha}$ shows a moderate increase at the pericentre passages, which affects the inference of LyC properties from Ly$\alpha$. We attribute this to a displacement of the LyC-emitting stars relative to the \Lya-emitting gas, combined with an increased density from gas compression. Furthermore, $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ is boosted during star formation bursts, likely due to stellar feedback. As direct comparison with Haro 11, the simulation qualitatively matches its morphology and luminosities. We find that among the dense stellar knots, knot C is the main contributor to both intrinsic and escaping LyC emission. Additionally, the Ly$\alpha$ spectra displays distinct features found in observations, implying similar gas conditions are present.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the linear polarization properties of radio sources within the 10 deg$^2$ Wide Chandra Deep Field South (W-CDFS) in S-band (2-4 GHz). Our W-CDFS image has an angular resolution of 15 arcsec and a 1$\sigma$ RMS in Stokes $I$ of $\approx$50 $\mu$Jy/beam. We detect 1920 distinct source components in Stokes $I$ and 175 in linear polarization. We examine the polarized source counts, Faraday Rotation measures, and fractional polarization of the sources in the survey. We show that sources with a total intensity above $\approx$10mJy have a mean fractional polarization value of $\approx$3% from modeling the polarized counts. We also calculate an estimate for the limit on the fractional polarization level of sources with a total intensity below 1mJy (mostly star-forming galaxies) of $\stackrel{<}{_{\sim}}$3% using stacking. The mean Faraday Rotation we measure is consistent with that due to the Milky Way. We also show that fractional polarization is correlated with in-band spectral index, consistent with a lower mean fractional polarization for the flat-spectrum population. In addition to characterizing the S-band polarization properties of sources in the W-CDFS, this study will be used to validate the shallower, but higher angular resolution S-band polarimetric information that the VLA Sky Survey will provide for the whole sky above Declination -40 degrees over the next few years.
#### The Initial Mass Function as the Equilibrium State of a Variational Process: why the IMF cannot be sampled stochastically

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar initial mass function (sIMF) is often treated as a stochastic probability distribution, yet such an interpretation implies Poisson noise that is inconsistent with growing observational evidence. In particular, the observed relation between the mass of the most massive star formed in an embedded cluster and the cluster's total stellar mass supports a deterministic sampling process, known as optimal sampling. However, the physical origin of optimal sampling has not been formally established in the literature. In this work, we show that the stellar mass distribution implied by optimal sampling emerges from applying the Maximum Entropy principle to the fragmentation of star-forming clumps, whose structure is set by density-dependent cooling in the optically thin regime. Here, the maximum entropy leads to unbiased distributions. By applying calculus of variations to minimize the entropy functional obtained assuming fragmentation, we recover the power-law form of the sIMF, and we show that any distribution deviating from the sIMF violates the Maximum Entropy principle. This work provides a first-principles foundation for the deterministic nature of star formation. Thus, the sIMF is the distribution resulting from a maximally unbiased system.
#### The LEGARE Project. I. Chemical evolution model of the Nuclear Stellar Disc in a Bayesian framework

 - **Abstract**
 The Nuclear Stellar Disc (NSD) of the Milky Way is a dense, rotating stellar system in the central 200 pc. The NSD is thought to be primarily fuelled by bar-driven gas inflows from the inner Galactic disc. As part of the LEGARE project, we construct the first chemical evolution models for the NSD using a Bayesian approach tailored to reproduce the observed metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) and compared with the available abundance ratios for Mg, Si, Ca relative to Fe. We adopt a state-of-the-art chemical evolution model in which the gas responsible for the formation of the NSD is assumed to be driven by the Galactic bar-induced inflows. The chemical composition of the accreted material is assumed to reflect that of the Galactic disc at a radius of 4 kpc. A Bayesian MCMC framework is used to fit the MDFs of different samples of NSD stars. If we take the NSD data at face value, without considering a possible contamination from bulge stars, we find that a formation scenario based on the inner disc flowing gas is inconsistent with the low metallicity tail of the observed MDF. This is because the inner disc metallicity, at the epoch of bar formation, was already near solar. On the other hand, models invoking dilution from additional metal-poor inflows successfully reproduce the observations. The best-fit model requires inflow metallicity 5 times lower than the inner disc and a moderate star formation efficiency. The same model successfully reproduces the observed [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] ratios and predicts a star formation history consistent with the most recent estimates. However, if we assume that the MDF is contaminated by metal poor bulge stars and restricted to [Fe/H] > -0.3 dex, gas dilution is no longer required. In this case, the best-fit model has a very low star formation efficiency and a mild galactic wind.
#### NOCTURNE. I. The radio spectrum of narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the radio emission in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is still debated. Multiple physical mechanisms can contribute to the spectrum at these frequencies, including relativistic jets, the jet base, outflows, star formation, and synchrotron emission from the hot corona. Recently, new extreme radio variability has been observed in the class of low-mass/high-Eddington AGN known as narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies, suggesting that another, more exotic mechanism may also play a role, especially at frequencies above 10 GHz. To investigate this relatively unexplored area of the radio spectrum, we observed a sample of 50 NLS1s with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and 20 of them were observed twice. In this sample, 24 sources were not detected, while the others are typically characterized by a steep spectrum that can be modeled with a power law. We also identified two new candidate jetted NLS1s, including a high-frequency peaker, which is an extremely young relativistic jet. We found no significant variability in the sources observed twice. We conclude that the radio spectrum of NLS1s is typically dominated by optically thin emission, likely from low-power outflows, or by circumnuclear star formation, with a limited contribution from relativistic jets. Further studies at different spatial scales and at other wavelengths are necessary to fully constrain the origin of the radio emission in this class of active galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing protostellar outflows is fundamental to understanding star formation feedback, yet traditional methods are often hindered by projection effects and complex morphologies. We present a multi-modal deep learning framework that jointly leverages spatial and spectral information from CO observations to infer outflow mass, inclination, and position angle ($PA$). Our model, trained on synthetic ALMA observations generated from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, utilizes a cross-attention fusion mechanism to integrate morphological and kinematic features with probabilistic uncertainty estimation. Our results demonstrate that Vision Transformer architectures significantly outperform convolutional networks, showing remarkable robustness to reduced spatial resolution. Interpretability analysis reveals a physically consistent hierarchy: spatial features dominate across all parameters, whereas spectral profiles provide secondary constraints for mass and inclination. Applied to observational ALMA data, the framework delivers stable mass and $PA$ estimates with exceptionally tightly constrained inclination angles. This study establishes multi-modal deep learning as a powerful, interpretable tool for overcoming projection biases in high-mass star formation studies.
#### Strontium-84 Enrichments in Presolar Grains Provide First Evidence of p-process Nucleosynthesis in Core-collapse Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 This study reports detection of rare p-process isotopes within presolar grains. Presolar grains are relic dust grains from dying stars. These microscopic dust particles are found in primitive solar system materials. Their distinct isotopic compositions record the nucleosynthetic processes in their parent stars and the Galactic chemical environment in which these stars formed. We studied presolar graphite grains of high-density type from the Murchison meteorite and found five grains with subgrains that show enrichments in 84Sr compared to the solar abundance.84Sr is the neutron-deficient isotope of strontium that can be produced in the deep oxygen-rich interior of high-mass stars that end their lives as core-collapse supernovae. The observed 84Sr excesses cannot be produced in low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars, the source of most high-density presolar graphites found in meteorites. High-density graphites with embedded 84Sr excesses are, instead, compatible with a core-collapse supernovae origin. The graphite subgrains condensed from carbon-rich materials in the outer layers of core-collapse supernovae, where 84Sr was destroyed by neutron captures during hydrostatic evolution of the stars and their final explosion. Based on current theoretical stellar models, a few percent of contribution from the inner regions of core-collapse supernovae, which are enriched in p-process nuclides, to the outer carbon-rich regions is the most likely explanation for the observed enrichment of 84Sr in the subgrains of the high-density graphites. In this study, we present the first observational evidence that core-collapse supernovae produce and eject isotopes made by the p-process.

 - **Abstract**
 We determine the galaxy luminosity function of cluster galaxies in the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 2199 (A2199), focusing on the faint-end slope down to $M_r \sim -14.5$. To achieve this, we augment the existing dataset by adding redshift data from our deep MMT/Hectospec survey and from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), significantly improving the spectroscopic completeness down to $r_{\mathrm{petro},0} = 20.8$ within the central $30^\prime$ region. The resulting luminosity function is well described by a Schechter function with a characteristic magnitude $M^* = -21.30 \pm 0.27$ and a faint-end slope $\alpha = -1.23 \pm 0.05$. This faint-end slope is consistent with those measured in the nearby Coma and Virgo clusters and in a cluster from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, and is slightly shallower than that of field galaxies. These findings indicate that the previously claimed steep faint-end upturn (with $\alpha \sim -2$) in nearby galaxy clusters is not supported. Instead, they indicate that environmental processes in dense cluster cores does not seem to trigger the formation or survival of low-mass galaxies, thereby preventing a steep faint-end upturn in the luminosity function.
#### Wave generation via oscillatory reconnection at a three-dimensional magnetic null point

 - **Abstract**
 This work conducts a three-dimensional (3D), nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation to investigate wave generating, time-dependent reconnection around a magnetic null point. A non-periodic perturbation (in the $xz$-plane) triggers oscillatory reconnection (OR) at the 3D null, resulting in a self-sustained oscillation with a constant period $P$. We investigate the response of the system using three distinct wave proxies (compressible parallel, compressible transverse and incompressible parallel) as well as Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for decoupling and analyzing the resultant MHD wave behavior. We find that OR generates a slow magnetoacoustic wave of period $P$ that propagates outwards in all directions along the spine and fan plane of the 3D null point. We also find the generation of a propagating Alfvén wave of period $P$, exclusively along the $y$-axis in the fan plane, i.e. in the direction perpendicular to the spine motion. These findings provide new insights into waves generated from a 3D null point and their implications for coronal seismology.
#### A Low-mass Model of The Milky Way: The Disk Warp Resulting from A Galaxy Merger

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies have shown that disk warps can result from galaxy mergers. Recent research indicates a noticeable decline in the rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way (MW), suggesting the need for a new low-mass model to describe its dynamical features. This study constructs a new Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger model to characterize the RC features of our galaxy. We use the GIZMO code to simulate mergers with various orbital parameters to investigate how the disk warp evolves under different conditions. This simulation demonstrates the evolutionary mechanism of disk warp, which arises due to the asymmetric gravitational potential of the dark matter (DM) halo generated universally by galaxy mergers. The results indicate that the tilt angle of the DM halo partly reflects the gravitational strength at the $Z=0$ plane, while the gravitational strength on the disk plane reflects the amplitude of disk warp. We identify a dual-regime interaction mechanism driven by the asymmetric halo potential. On short timescales, we find a distinct anti-correlation between the halo's tilt angle and the disk's warp amplitude, indicating a `seesaw' mechanism of angular momentum exchange. On secular timescales, however, dynamical friction drives a global alignment, causing both the halo tilt and the warp amplitude to decay simultaneously. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high-inclination mergers can sustain long-lived prograde precession, where the persistent yet decaying gravitational torque maintains the prograde bending mode against differential wind-up.
#### Detection of hot subdwarf binaries and sdB stars using machine learning methods and a large sample of Gaia XP spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Hot subdwarfs (hot sds) are compact, evolved stars near the Extreme Horizontal Branch (EHB) and are key to understanding stellar evolution and the ultraviolet excess in galaxies. We extend our previous analysis of Gaia XP spectra of hot subdwarf stars to a much larger sample, enabling a comprehensive study of their physical and binary properties. Our goal is to identify patterns in Gaia XP spectra, investigate binarity, and assess the influence of parameters such as temperature, helium abundance, and variability. We analyse approximately 20000 hot subdwarf candidates selected from the literature, combining Gaia XP data with published parameters. We apply Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to the XP coefficients, which represent the Gaia XP spectra in a compact, feature-based form, to construct a similarity map. We then use self-organizing maps (SOMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify spectra as binaries or singles, and as cool and helium-poor or hot and helium-rich. The spectra are normalised using asymmetric least squares baseline fitting to emphasise individual spectral features. The BP-RP colour dominates the similarity map, with additional influence from temperature, helium abundance, and variability. Most binaries, identified via the Virtual Observatory SED Analyser (VOSA), cluster in two filaments linked to main sequence companions. CNN classification suggests a strong correlation between variability and binarity, with binary fractions exceeding 60 percent for active hot subdwarfs. Gaia XP spectra combined with dimensionality reduction and machine learning effectively reveal patterns in hot subdwarf properties. Our findings indicate that binarity and environmental density strongly shape the evolutionary paths of hot subdwarfs, and we identify possible contamination by main sequence and cataclysmic variable stars in the base sample.
#### A UV-Luminous Galaxy at z=11 with Surprisingly Weak Star Formation Activity

 - **Abstract**
 One of the major discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the identification of a large population of luminous galaxies at $z>10$, challenging theoretical models for early galaxy formation. The unexpectedly high number density of these systems has triggered intense debate about potential differences in the physical properties of galaxies at such extreme redshifts and those at lower redshift. However, progress has been limited by the lack of rest-frame optical diagnostics, which are critical for constraining the key properties. Here we present deep JWST/MIRI observations of a UV-luminous galaxy at $z=11.04$, CEERS2-588, only 400 Myr after the Big Bang. CEERS2-588 is detected in the MIRI F560W and F770W bands, while deep MIRI/MRS spectroscopy yields no detection of H$\alpha$ or [OIII]$\lambda5007$ line, revealing a prominent Balmer break detected for the first time at $z>10$. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting indicates an extended star formation history possibly reaching $z>15$, followed by rapid quenching within the recent $\sim10$ Myr, in stark contrast to other $z>10$ galaxies. The MIRI detections also significantly improve our stellar mass estimate to $\mathrm{log}(M_*/M_\odot)=9.1^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$, making CEERS2-588 the most massive galaxy securely confirmed at $z>10$. Remarkably, the inferred gas-phase metallicity is near solar, exceeding predictions from current theoretical models. These results suggest that efficient starbursts play a key role in producing the abundant luminous galaxy population in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are among the densest stellar systems in the Universe and often coexist with supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at galaxy centres. While SMBH formation histories are essentially lost, NSCs preserve evolutionary imprints through their stellar populations and stellar kinematics, reflecting the cumulative effects of mergers, accretion, and internal dynamical evolution. We aim to investigate the orbital structure of the unusually large NSC in FCC 47 (NGC 1336) by decomposing its stellar orbits into dynamically distinct components. We extract stellar kinematics, and in particular the line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs), from VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy using the non-parametric Bayes-LOSVD approach, and apply triaxial Schwarzschild orbit-superposition modelling with the DYNAMITE software. We decompose the orbit library into hot, warm, cold, and counter-rotating components. We detect triple-peaked LOSVDs in the nucleus, indicating a complex orbital structure. The NSC forms a counter-rotating, kinematically decoupled component. A hot pressure-supported component, a warm counter-rotating structure and a counter-rotating cold disk in the centre suggest hierarchical assembly via early star cluster accretion and later in situ star formation. Our orbital decomposition of FCC 47 supports a hybrid formation scenario for this NSC. Dynamically distinct substructures reflect the interplay of accretion and in situ star formation during galaxy evolution.
#### Mapping the Extended Lyman-Alpha Emission within the Circumgalactic Medium of Quasars Hosted by Dusty Starbursts with CubeCarve

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of extended Ly$\alpha$ emission around four quasars hosted by dusty starbursts, which are composite systems thought to represent a transitional stage in quasar evolution. To extract faint CGM emission in the presence of bright point sources, we introduce {\it CubeCarve}, a dual-channel deconvolution algorithm that separates unresolved quasar emission from spatially extended structure. This approach enables reliable recovery of \Lya\ emission projected onto the quasar position without introducing subtraction artifacts. Using {\it CubeCarve}, we find that the \Lya\ surface brightness profiles of these systems are, on average, fainter and shallower than those of quasars of similar bolometric luminosities. We also find that the total integrated \Lya\ luminosities of the nebulae are lower in systems whose host galaxies exhibit brighter far-infrared emission. These results suggest that the CGM conditions in composite systems differ from those in the broader quasar population. Our study highlights both the physical diversity of quasar CGM environments and the effectiveness of {\it CubeCarve} for recovering diffuse emission in modern IFU datasets.
