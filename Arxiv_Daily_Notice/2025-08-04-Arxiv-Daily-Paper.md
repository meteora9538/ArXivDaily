 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of GRB 240825A, a bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected by Fermi and Swift, with a prompt duration ($T_{\rm 90}$ ~ 4 sec in 50-300 keV) near the boundary separating short and long GRBs, prompting a detailed investigation into its classification and progenitor. Using classical prompt metrics (duration, minimum variability timescale (MVT), lag, and spectral hardness) and modern classification techniques (machine-learning (ML) based t-SNE, support vector machine, energy-hardness-duration, and $\epsilon \equiv E_{\gamma,\mathrm{iso},52} / E_{p,z,2}^{5/3}$), we find GRB 240825A exhibits hybrid characteristics. The short MVT (13.830 $\pm$ 1.574 ms), rest-frame duration, and ML-based classification indicate a merger-like or ambiguous nature, while its energetics and position on the Amati relation favor a collapsar origin. We conducted deep optical and NIR photometric and spectroscopic late-time search for an associated supernova (SN)/kilonova (KN) and the host galaxy using 10.4 m GTC and 8.4 m binocular LBT telescopes. No bright SN (like SN 1998bw) is detected down to stringent limits (e.g., $m_r > 26.1$ mag at 17.59 days), despite a redshift of $z$ = 0.659 measured from GTC spectroscopy. Host galaxy SED modeling with Prospector indicates a massive, dusty, and star-forming galaxy-typical of collapsar GRB hosts, though with low sSFR and large offset. We compare these findings with hybrid events like GRB 211211A, GRB 230307A, GRB 200826A, including SNe-GRBs, and conclude that GRB 240825A likely originated from a massive star collapse, with the associated supernova obscured by a dusty host environment or low luminosity SN with absolute magnitude M$_{V}$ fainter than -18.0. This study emphasizes the need for multiwavelength follow-up and a multi-layered classification to determine GRB progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 It is generally believed that long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate from the core collapse of rapidly spinning massive stars and at least some of them are powered by hyper-accreting black holes. However, definite proofs about the progenitor and central engine of these GRBs have not been directly observed in the past. Here we report the existence of a Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) signature with periodic frequency $\sim$0.02 Hz in the early X-ray afterglow phase of GRB 220711B. Such a low-frequency QPO likely signals the precession of a relativistic jet launched from a GRB hyper-accreting black hole central engine. The energy injection signature from the \textbf{late} X-ray observations (from $5\times 10^2s\sim 1\times10^4s$) is consistent with the precession hypothesis. The prompt $\gamma$-ray light curve does not show any QPO signature, suggesting that the X-ray flaring emission in the early afterglow phase and prompt emission likely originate from different accretion processess, indicating that the progenitor stars of GRBs have a core-envelope structure with a stratified angular momentum distribution and the late-time accretion disk likely has a misalignment with respect to the rotation axis of the black hole. Such a misalignment is not expected in a canonical collapsar model. As a result, the QPO signature in GRB 220711B may reveal a new formation channel of long GRBs, possibly a stellar-merger-induced core collapse, with the orbital angular momentum of the binary misaligned with the spin axis of the collapsing star.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\gamma$-ray light curve of long-duration GRB 220711B, is characterized by a multi-peaked structure with a duration lasting $\sim$105 seconds. More interestingly, the X-ray afterglow light curve is composed of a plateau emission smoothly connected with a $\sim t^{-2}$ segment overlapping some flares followed by an extremely steep decay. By analysing the light curves of both prompt emission and X-ray afterglow, no high-confidence-level quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signals are found in the light curves of the prompt emission (e.g., BAT and GBM), but it is found that a QPO signal at $\sim$ 50 s above 6$\sigma$ confidence level indeed exist in the X-ray afterglow. Here, we propose that a supra-massive magnetar as the central engine of GRB 220711B with precession motion is a good interpretation of the features of the X-ray emission. The initial plateau emission and followed decay segment, as well as the extremely steep-decay segment, are consistent with the physical process of supra-massive magnetar spin-down and then collapse into black hole. Moreover, the QPO signal in the X-ray emission can be explained as an effect of the precession motion of the magnetar. If this is the case, one can derive various magnetar parameters such as the initial period ($P_{\rm{0}}$) and surface magnetic field strength ($B_{\rm{p}}$) within a pseudo-redshift range of [1.08, 4.27]. By considering beaming corrections with jet opening angle $5^{\circ}$, we find that $P_{\rm{0}}$ and $B_{\rm{p}}$ lie within the range of [1.87, 6.25] ms and [$1.47\times 10^{16}$, $3.09\times 10^{16}$] G, respectively. The parameter of $B_{\rm{p}}$ is slightly larger than that of other typical long-duration GRBs, but $P_{\rm{0}}$ fall in a reasonable range.

 - **Abstract**
 The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a flagship ultraviolet/optical/infrared space telescope recommended by the National Academies' Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics, will require detector technologies capable of supporting significantly larger pixel-count arrays than previous missions. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), naturally suited to microwave multiplexing readout, are already in use across several balloon-borne missions with FPGA-based systems. To transition this capability to space, we are developing a radiation-hardened detector readout system that builds directly on the technical and environmental requirements defined by the PRIMA mission. PRIMA serves as a critical pathfinder, informing the radiation tolerance, resource constraints, and on-board processing capabilities needed for HWO. In this work, we present our current results on algorithm implementation, hardware architecture, and firmware development using the radiation-hardened AMD Kintex Ultrascale FPGA, aligning with PRIMA's stringent specifications to ensure compatibility with future space-based observatories like HWO.

 - **Abstract**
 A subset of low-mass giants ($<2.2\,M_{\odot}$) exhibit anomalous lithium enhancement behavior, which is still an open topic. Given that more massive giants retain more surface lithium, increasing mass by accreting circumstellar matter could be a channel to enrich lithium. We evaluate this process in the current work. Using MESA, we construct a model of matter accretion, including mass loss, that evolves a star from the main sequence turnoff to the red giant branch tip. The mean accretion rate is estimated from the upper limit of the accreted mass and the evolutionary time of the star during this period, and a grid of accretion rates is constructed. We separately consider their effects on the lithium enhancement of giants, both in terms of the mass and the composition of accretion. Accreting matter with higher lithium abundances has a promoting effect on the lithium enhancement of giants. The accreted matter with excess lithium alleviates the dilution of lithium in the convective envelope during the first dredge-up. The added mass results in lower temperatures at the bottom of the convective envelope, which likewise weakens the depletion of surface lithium. Weak accretion of circumstellar matter is a possible route to lithium enhancement for giants, and it predicts an upper limit on the lithium abundance of $\rm \sim 2.5\,dex$. However, the mass increment it requires poses a potential challenge to real astrophysical environments. Such accretion suppresses lithium dilution and depletion of the star during the first dredge-up, thus exhibiting lithium enhancement behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an observational evidence supporting the scenario that the protogalactic angular momenta play the most decisive role in molding the optical sizes of present galaxies. Analyzing the NASA-Sloan Atlas catalog in the redshift range of $0.02\le z<0.09$, we observationally determine the probability density distributions, $p(r_{50})$ and $p(r_{90})$, where $r_{50}$ and $r_{90}$ denote the galaxy sizes enclosing $50\%$ and $90\%$ of their $r$-band luminosities, respectively. Both of the distributions are found to be well described by a bimodal Gamma mixture model, which is consistent with the recent numerical results. Classifying the local galaxies by their ratios, $r_{50}/r_{90}$, we also show that for the case of late-type galaxies with $r_{50}/r_{90}\ge 0.45$ both of $p(r_{50})$ and $p(r_{90})$ exhibit no bimodal feature, following a unimodal Gamma model. Assuming the existence of a linear causal correlation between $\{r_{50},r_{90}\}$ of the late-type galaxies and the primordial spin factor, $\tau$, defined as the degree of misalignments between the initial tidal and protogalaxy inertia tensors, we reconstruct the probability density distributions, $p(\tau)$, directly from the observationally determined $p(r_{50})$ and $p(r_{90})$ of the late-type galaxies, and show excellent agreements with the real distributions of $\tau$ which were determined at the protogalactic stages by numerical experiments. A critical implication of our result on reconstructing the initial conditions from observable galaxy sizes is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Many Galactic globular clusters (GCs) originated in diverse host galaxies before being subsequently incorporated into the Milky Way through hierarchical galaxy assembly. Identifying their origins is crucial for revealing galaxy properties at early times. Traditional classification methods relying on dynamical properties face inherent uncertainties stemming from the evolving Galactic potential and complex merger histories. Chemically driven classification confronts a distinct obstacle: multiple populations - abundance variations in light elements of GC members. In this Letter, we identify primordial populations exhibiting lower [Al/Fe] as reliable tracers of their birth environments' chemical evolution. A clear chemical dichotomy emerges between in-situ and accreted GC populations at [Fe/H] > -1.5, particularly in the [Mg/Fe]-[Al/Fe] plane, indicating that their progenitor galaxies have experienced fundamentally different enrichment histories. While our chemically driven classification demonstrates general consistency with dynamically driven classifications, notable discrepancies emerge: NGC 288 and M4 are reclassified as in-situ, and Terzan 9 as accreted. This chemically driven GC classification provides promising application for Galactic archaeology.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a search for megaparsec-scale sources in the NVGRC catalog of candidates of giant radio source (GRS) based on the NVSS sky survey. We visually inspected 370 NVGRC sources, as well as radio sources falling within a neighborhood of about one square degree around the target object. In the studied sample, 48% of objects were classified as giant radio sources, 14% as sources with a projected linear size of less than 0.72 Mpc, and 38\% as physically unrelated objects combined by the recognition algorithm into one radio source. We identified 197 gaints, of which 72 radio sources are known GRGs or GRQs, and 125 sources were identified by us as GRS for the first time. Comparing the proportion of FRI giants in four redshift bins, we found that for z<0.05, the proportions of FRI and FRII sources were approximately equal, but already at z>0.15 the proportion of FRI giants decreases sharply. The predominance of FRII giants in the GRS lists is most likely due to observational selection due to the sensitivity limit of existing radio surveys. Comparing the NVSS and VLASS cutouts, we found that 33% of sources can be classified as fadded. 25% of the sources show a restart of the radio source phase. 38% of the sources have deformed radio lobes. Our GRS sample includes 74% of galaxies, 15% of IR-excess galaxies, which, according to the WISE photometric data, can be attributed to quasars, and 11% of quasars. When visually examining the optical survey cutouts, we noted the presence of close neighbors for the hosts and/or their belonging to known groups or clusters of galaxies. Close neighbors at a distance of less than 50 kpc were found for 39% of radio sources, and 28% of sources are part of groups or clusters of galaxies. Thus, about 70% of gaints are in a fairly dense environment, and this proportion may be higher.

 - **Abstract**
 The substellar initial mass function (IMF) and the formation mechanisms of brown dwarfs (BDs) remain key open questions in star formation theory. IMF characterization in a large number of star-forming regions (SFRs) is essential for constraining these processes. We aim to identify and spectroscopically confirm very low-mass members of the Corona Australis (CrA) SFR to refine its substellar census, determine its low-mass IMF, and compare it to other clusters. Using deep I-band photometry from SuprimeCam/Subaru and data from the VISTA Hemisphere Survey, we identified low-mass BD candidates in CrA. We subsequently obtained NIR spectra of 173 of these candidates with KMOS/VLT, as well as optical spectra for 8 kinematic candidate members using FLOYDS/LCO. The kinematic candidates are confirmed as low-mass stellar members with spectral types M1 to M5. In contrast, all 173 BD candidates observed with KMOS are identified as contaminants. Although the follow-up yielded no new substellar members, it places strong constraints on the number of undetected substellar objects in the region. Combined with literature data, this enables us to derive the substellar IMF, which is consistent with a single power-law slope of alpha = 0.95+-0.06 in the range 0.01-1 MSun or alpha = 0.33+-0.19 in the range 0.01-0.1 MSun. The star-to-BD ratio in CrA is about 2. We also provide updated IMFs and star-to-BD ratios for Lupus3 and ChaI from the SONYC survey, reflecting revised distances from Gaia. Finally, we estimate surface densities and median FUV fluxes for 6 SFRs and clusters and compare their substellar populations as a function of environmental properties. The IMF and star-to-BD ratio show no clear dependence on stellar density or ionizing flux from the massive stars. A combined effect - where one factor enhances and the other suppresses BD formation - also appears unlikely. (Abridged)
#### Analogues of the Milky Way-Sagittarius interaction in the TNG50: effect on the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 The Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy is undoubtedly being disrupted in the tidal field of the Milky Way. The Milky Way disc is also found to be in a state of disequilibrium. The role of the Sagittarius in driving or contributing to this disequilibrium has been extensively investigated. Most of these studies, however, assume an initially near-equilibrium disc. It was also hypothesized that the passage of Sagittarius could have increased the star-forming activity in the Solar Neighbourhood. We check whether galaxies that have undergone cosmological evolution are affected by interactions analogous to those between the Sagittarius and the Milky Way. We use the high-resolution simulation TNG50 to look for pairs similar to the Milky Way and Sagittarius. We search within redshift z=1-0 for discs from the MW/M31 sample that interacted with a satellite more massive than 10 billion Msun, had a pericenter smaller than 50 kpc, and was on an approximately polar orbit. We exclude cases where, within 1 Gyr of the pericenter, a similar interaction occurred. In 90 percent of cases, a passage of the Sagittarius analogue had no significant effect on either the vertical velocity field of the disc or the star formation history. A response in vertical stellar kinematics can be found mostly in cold discs and mildly correlates with the strength of interactions. For star formation, the studied interactions had an effect only when little to no star formation was ongoing prior to the interaction, often due to previously disturbed star-forming discs, e.g., from AGN activity. Our results indicate that stellar discs in TNG50 are frequently vertically perturbed preceding pericenter passages of Sagittarius analogues. Future studies using other simulations and extragalactic surveys will help establish whether vertical disequilibrium is a common feature of disc galaxies or an artifact of the specific setup studied.

 - **Abstract**
 We searched for young asteroid families -- those with ages t_age < 10 Myr and at least three members -- using the proper element catalog from Nesvorny et al. (2024). Our approach employed the Hierarchical Clustering Method (HCM) in a five-dimensional space of proper orbital elements: semimajor axis, eccentricity, inclination, proper nodal longitude, and proper perihelion longitude. The proper longitudes were calculated for various times in the past. Any convergence of these angles at times t < 10 Myr ago was automatically identified by our algorithm as a clustering event in 5D space at time t. Using this method, we successfully recovered all previously known young families (over 40) and discovered 63 additional ones. The formation ages of these families were determined through backward orbital integrations. To validate orbital convergence, we applied three different methods and obtained generally consistent results. Notably, the vast majority of identified young families have the formation ages t_age < 1 Myr. The number and properties of these families provide valuable constraints on the frequency of recent large cratering or catastrophic collisions, offering new insights into the ongoing collisional evolution of the main asteroid belt. Alternatively, at least some of the families identified here could have been produced by the spin-up and rotational fission of their parent bodies. Future studies should address the relative importance of collisions and rotational fission for young asteroid families identified here.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to characterize the physical and activity properties of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS through spectroscopic and photometric observations during the first month after its discovery. We performed time-series photometry and long-slit spectroscopy between 2 and 29 July 2025 using multiple ground-based telescopes. Photometric data were calibrated against field stars from the ATLAS and APASS catalogs, and Fourier analysis was applied to derive the comet's rotational period. Spectral data were obtained using the SALT telescope and Nordic Optical Telescope. We report a spin period of $16.16 \pm 0.01$ h with a lightcurve amplitude of approximately 0.3 mag. The comet exhibits increasing dust activity and reddening colors during the observation period, with no visible tail detected, likely due to viewing geometry and low dust production. Dust mass loss rates are estimated between 0.3 and 4.2 kg s^-1, consistent with weakly active distant comets. Spectral colors are similar to those of outer Solar System comets and differ from previously reported values for 3I/ATLAS. The morphological and photometric properties of 3I/ATLAS are consistent with a weakly active comet of outer Solar System origin, despite its interstellar provenance. Continued monitoring around perihelion is necessary to track changes in activity, color, which will provide insights into the evolution of interstellar materials under solar radiation.
