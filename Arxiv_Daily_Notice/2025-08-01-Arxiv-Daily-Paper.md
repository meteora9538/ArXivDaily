 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the Milky Way disc formation requires characterising its structural and kinematic properties as functions of stellar age. Using red giant stars from APOGEE DR17 and Gaia DR3, we model the age-dependent stellar kinematics with a quasi-isothermal distribution function and fit disc parameters as a function of age using non-parametric splines. We identify a transition from thick to thin disc populations around 10 Gyr ago. Stars older than this have short scale lengths ($\sim$1.7 kpc), typical of the thick disc, while younger stars exhibit increasing scale length with decreasing age, consistent with inside-out formation of the thin disc. This transition coincides with the end of the starburst triggered by the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger. Stars formed around 10 Gyr ago exhibit a dip in scale length, even shorter than that of the thick disc. Comparison with an Auriga simulation suggests that this scale-length dip reflects gas disc shrinking caused by the transition from a cold to hot gas accretion mode. We propose the following disc formation scenario: (1) the thick disc formed under cold-mode accretion; (2) the GSE merger triggered a starburst and increased the total mass of the Galaxy, causing the transition to hot-mode accretion; (3) rapid gas consumption led to temporary shrinking of the star-forming gas disc; and then (4) thin disc grows in an inside-out fashion, as the size of the star-forming gas disc grows via hot-mode smooth gas accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations by JWST reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of rapidly growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe, underscoring the need for improved models for their origin and growth. Employing new full radiative transfer hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, we investigate the local and intergalactic feedback of SMBH progenitors for the Population III.1 scenario, i.e., efficient formation of supermassive stars from pristine, undisturbed dark matter minihalos. Our cosmological simulations capture the R-type expansion phase of these Pop III.1 stars, with their H-ionizing photon luminosities of $\sim10^{53}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ generating HII regions that extend deep into the intergalactic medium, reaching comoving radii of $r_{\rm HII}\sim 1\,{\rm cMpc}$. We vary both the Pop III.1 ionization flux and cosmological formation environments, finding the former regulates their final $r_{\rm HII}$, whereas the latter is more important in setting their formation redshift. We use the results from our radiation-hydrodynamics simulations to estimate the cosmic number density of SMBHs, $n_{\rm SMBH}$, expected from Pop III.1 progenitors. We find $n_{\rm SMBH}\sim10^{-1}\,{\rm cMpc}^{-3}$, consistent with the results inferred from recent observations of the local and high redshift universe. Overall, this establishes Pop III.1 progenitors as viable candidates for the formation of the first SMBHs, and emphasises the importance of exploring heavy mass seed scenarios.
#### Capturing star formation activity from compressed photometric images of galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel approach for classifying star-forming galaxies using photometric images. By utilizing approximately $124,000$ optical color composite images and spectroscopic data of nearby galaxies at $0.01<z<0.06$ from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, along with follow-up spectroscopic line measurements from the OSSY catalog, and leveraging the Vision Transformer machine-learning technique, we demonstrate that galaxy images in JPEG format alone can be directly used to determine whether star-forming activity dominates the galaxy, bypassing traditional spectroscopic analyses such as emission-line diagnostic diagrams. We anticipate that this method holds significant potential for application in current and future large-scale surveys, such as Euclid, the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).
#### Chandra X-ray Observatory study of the X-ray emission of PKS 0023-26 and comparison with recent ALMA results

 - **Abstract**
 We present a deep high-resolution Chandra X-ray Observatory image data of a powerful compact radio source PKS 0023-26 associated with a quasar at redshift 0.322. The earlier studies of the optical environment suggested that the source could be located in a galaxy cluster or a group. However, we report a non-detection of hot gas on large scales (out to $\sim 60$ kpc radius) and place an upper limit on the X-ray luminosity of $<3\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, consistent only with the presence of a poor, low-temperature ($\rm kT < 0.5$ keV) galaxy group. X-ray spectral analysis of the central circular region, $r<7$ kpc shows, in addition to the mildly absorbed AGN, a thermal emission component with a temperature of $\rm kT=0.9^{+0.19}_{-0.37}$ keV. We discuss the origin of this hot component as a result of interaction between the evolving radio source and the interstellar medium. Our high angular resolution X-ray image traces the distribution of hot gas which is closely aligned with and extends beyond the radio source, and also in the direction perpendicular to the radio source axis. The X-rays are enhanced at the northern radio lobe and the location of the peak of the CO(3-2)/CO(2-1) line emission, suggesting that the interactions between the jet and cold medium result in the X-ray radiation which excites CO. The shock driven by the jet into the ISM is supersonic with the Mach number of $\mathcal{M} \sim 1.75-2$, creating the cocoon of hot X-rays surrounding the radio source. This result agrees with observations of shocks in other radio galaxies pointing to a prevalent impact of jets on ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 We present near-infrared JHKs and narrow-band H2(1-0) photometric observations of the W51A region, obtained with GTC EMIR, aiming to characterize its young stellar population and provide mass estimates for individual cluster members and the proto-clusters. Our observations reveal over 3000 new sources, out of which 88 are located in the proto-clusters, W51 IRS2 and W51 Main. The average extinction (AV), measured from the J-H color, of sources is 19 AV in W51 IRS2 and 14 AV in W51 Main. We document 17 new instances of H2 emission in the region by utilizing observations from the H2(1-0) narrow-band filter. Despite limited completeness, we estimated masses for each cluster member and estimated the total cluster mass to be in the range of 900-4700 solar masses for W51 IRS2 and 500-2700 solar masses for W51 Main, using an assumed age range of 1-3 Myr. We measured the initial mass function (IMF) in the proto-clusters assuming a range of ages from 1-3 Myr and found that the IMF slopes for both proto-clusters are consistent with the Salpeter IMF in the mass range greater than or equal to 8 solar masses within 1 to 2 sigma.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief, high-energy bursts of radio waves from extragalactic sources, and their origin remains an open question. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the FRB population using the first CHIME/FRB catalog, focusing on their energy and redshift distribution, with careful consideration of selection effects. We investigate a range of models, including the Schechter function and the broken power-law function for the energy distribution, and several redshift evolution models, such as the star formation history (SFH) model, as well as models incorporating time delays relative to the SFH or additional redshift evolution factors. Our results indicate that the energy distribution of FRBs is best described by the Schechter function, with a power-law index of $\gamma = -1.49^{+0.37}_{-0.27}$ and a characteristic cutoff energy of $E_\mathrm{c} = 2.82^{+2.43}_{-1.47} \times 10^{41}$ erg. Furthermore, we find no evidence for redshift evolution in the energy distribution of FRBs. In terms of their redshift distribution, our analysis shows that it follows the cosmic SFH, without requiring additional delayed components or redshift evolution factors, suggesting that most FRBs likely originate from young stellar populations. Simultaneously, we infer a local volumetric rate of $\Phi_0 = 4.68^{+4.66}_{-2.39} \times 10^{4} \rm \ Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ for $E>10^{39}$ erg. These results, robust against CHIME observational biases, may provide new insights into the underlying properties of the FRB population.

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical models have long predicted the existence of shocks in multi-transonic accretion flows onto a black hole, yet their fate under realistic general relativistic simulations has not been fully tested. In this study, we present results from high-resolution two-dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of low-angular-momentum accretion flows onto Kerr black holes, focusing on the formation of shocks in transonic accretion flow. We demonstrate that for specific combinations of energy and angular momentum, global shock solutions naturally emerge between multiple sonic points. These shocks are sustained in both corotating and counter-rotating cases, and their locations depend on specific energy, angular momentum, and the spin of the black hole which is in good agreement with analytical solutions. In magnetized flows, weak magnetic fields preserve the shock structure, whereas strong fields suppress it, enhancing turbulence and driving powerful, magnetically dominated jets/outflows. The strength and structure of the outflow also depend on a black hole spin and magnetization, with higher black hole spin parameters leading to faster jets. Shock solutions are found only in super-Alfvénic regions, where kinetic forces dominate. Our findings provide important insights into the physics of hot corona formation and jet launching in low-angular-momentum accretion systems such as Sgr~A$^*$ (weak jet/outflow) and X-ray binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Among high-redshift galaxies, aside from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), X-ray binaries (XRBs) can be significant sources of X-ray emission. XRBs play a crucial role in galaxy evolution, reflecting the stellar populations of galaxies and regulating star formation through feedback, thereby shaping galaxy structure. In this study, we report a spectroscopically confirmed X-ray emitting galaxy pair (UDF3 and UDF3-2) at $z = 2.544$. By combining multi-wavelength observations from JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectra, JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging, Chandra, HST, VLT, ALMA, and VLA, we analyze the ionized emission lines, which are primarily driven by H II region-like processes. Additionally, we find that the mid-infrared radiation can be fully attributed to dust emission from galaxy themselves. Our results indicate that the X-ray emission from these two galaxies is dominated by high-mass XRBs, with luminosities of $L_X= (1.43\pm0.40) \times 10^{42} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ for UDF3, and $(0.40\pm0.12) \times 10^{42} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ for UDF3-2. Furthermore, we measure the star formation rate (SFR) of $529_{-88}^{+64}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for UDF3, placing it $\approx$ 0.5 dex below the $L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation. This offset reflects the redshift-dependent enhancement of $L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation, which is influenced by metallicity and serves as a key observable for XRB evolution. In contrast, UDF3-2, with the SFR of $34_{-6}^{+6}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, aligns well with the $L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation. This galaxy pair represents the highest-redshift non-AGN-dominated galaxies with individual X-ray detections reported to date. This finding suggests that the contribution of XRBs to galaxy X-ray emission at high redshift may be underestimated.

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray polarimetric observing window re-opening is shedding new light on our current understanding of compact accreting sources. This is true, in particular, for stellar-mass black hole sources observed in the thermally-dominated state, for which the polarization signal is expected to depend on the accretion disk inclination and the black hole spin. Two main effects determine the polarization properties of the accretion disk emission: the absorption and scattering processes occurring before the radiation leaves the disk atmosphere, and the relativistic effects influencing its propagation towards the observer at infinity. In this work, we investigate these effects together considering only the contribution of direct radiation. We analyze how the ionization state of the disk atmosphere, approximated with a constant-density surface layer assumed to be either in collisional ionization equilibrium or photoionization equilibrium, can influence the spectro-polarimetric properties of the radiation at the emitting disk surface. Subsequently we study how these are modified by the propagation in a strong gravitational field.

 - **Abstract**
 We present full polarization MeerKAT images of the wide-angle tail, giant radio galaxy J1712$-$2435 at 1.3 GHz with 7.\asec5 resolution and an RMS sensitivity of 8 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Due to the angular proximity to the Galactic Center (l=359.6$^\circ$, b=+8.5$^\circ$) the immediate environment is not well understood but there are massive clusters nearby. Emission can be traced over an extent of 34.\amin6 which at the redshift of 0.024330 corresponds to a projected length of 1.02 Mpc. The inner jets are quite straight but then bend and completely decollimate into extended plumes nearly orthogonal to the initial jet directions at a projected distance of approximately 100 kpc. The nearly unity brightness ratio of the inner jets suggest that they are orientated within a few degrees of the plane of the sky. The 1400 MHz power is 3.9$\times 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, somewhat below the FRI/FRII divide. The total power emitted is estimated to be 5.6$\times 10^{41}$ erg sec$^{-1}$ over the range 10 MHz to 100 GHz. The source dynamics are modeled with magneto-hydrodynamics simulations; the result is a rough reproduction of the source's radio morphology / appearance. This study further highlights the merit of alternative scenarios, calling for future observational and numerical efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 The estimation of the number of point-sources in the sky is one the oldest problems in astronomy, yet an easy and efficient method for estimating the uncertainty on these counts is still an open problem. Probabilistic cataloging solves the general point-source inference problem, but the trans-dimensional nature of the inference method requires a bespoke approach that is difficult to scale. Here it is shown that probabilistic cataloging can be performed in a fixed-dimensional framework called Parametric Cataloging under mild assumptions on some of the priors. The method requires only a simple reparameterization of the flux coordinates, yielding an accessible method that can be implemented in most probabilistic programming environments. As the parameter space is fixed-dimensional, off the shelf gradient based samplers can be employed which allows the method to scale to tens of thousands of sources.
#### The JWST Unveils the Bimodal Nature of Lyman Alpha Emitters at 3 <z<7: Pristine versus Merger-Driven Populations

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic study of merging galaxies among Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) using JWST/NIRCam high-resolution imaging data. From a large sample of 817 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at $3<z<7$ in the GOODS-S field, we identify late-stage mergers and interacting systems with fractions of $39.4\%\pm2.5\%$ and $60.6\%\pm6.3\%$, respectively. These fractions exhibit significant redshift evolution and depend on both stellar mass ($M_*$) and UV magnitude ($M_{\rm UV}$), being most prevalent in massive ($\log(M_*/M_\odot)>8.5$) and bright ($M_{\rm UV}<-19.5$) systems. At fixed $M_*$ and $M_{\rm UV}$, we find negligible differences in the UV slope ($\beta$) between late-stage mergers and isolated LAEs; however, a clear bimodal distribution emerges in the $M_*$-sSFR plane, where isolated LAEs peak at $\log(M_*/M_\odot)\approx7.8$ and $\log({\rm sSFR/yr^{-1}})\approx-7.4$, and late-stage mergers peak at $\log(M_*/M_\odot)\approx8.6$ and $\log({\rm sSFR/yr^{-1}})\approx-7.6$. Our results reveal two evolutionary classes -- Pristine LAEs, low-mass ($M_*<10^{8.5}M_\odot$), isolated systems that represent early-stage galaxies with minimal merger interactions, and Merger-driven LAEs, massive ($M_*>10^{8.5}M_\odot$) systems in which mergers enhance star formation and facilitate the escape of Lyman-alpha photons or accrete pristine LAEs -- both of which are consistent with both observational and theoretical expectations and collectively demonstrate that mergers are a central driver of LAE evolution across the first two billion years.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino-cooled accretion disks can form in the aftermath of neutron-star mergers as well as during the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars (collapsars) and the accretion-induced collapse of rapidly rotating white dwarfs. Due to Pauli blocking as electrons become degenerate at sufficiently high accretion rates $\dot{M}$, the resulting 'self-neutronization' of the dissociated accreting plasma makes these astrophysical systems promising sources of rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis (the r-process). We present a one-dimensional general-relativistic, viscous-hydrodynamic model of neutrino-cooled accretion disks around black holes. With collapsars, super-collapsars and very massive star collapse in mind, we chart the composition of the accretion flow and systematically explore different radiatively efficient and inefficient accretion regimes with increasing $\dot M$, across a vast parameter space of $\dot{M}\sim 10^{-6}-10^6 M_\odot \,\text{s}^{-1}$, black hole masses of $M_\bullet\sim 1 - 10^4 M_\odot$ and dimensionless spins of $\chi_\bullet \in [0,1)$, as well as $\alpha$-viscosity values of $\alpha\sim 10^{-3}-1$. We show that these accretion regimes are separated by characteristic thresholds $\dot{M}_{\rm char}$ that follow power laws $\dot M_{\rm char}\propto M_{\bullet}^\alpha \alpha^\beta$ and that can be understood based on analytic approximations we derive. We find that outflows from such disks are promising sites of r-process nucleosynthesis up to $M_\bullet \lesssim 3000 M_\odot$. These give rise to lanthanide-bearing 'red' super-kilonovae transients mostly for $M_\bullet \lesssim 200-500 M_\odot$ and lanthanide suppressed 'blue' super-kilonovae for larger $M_\bullet$. Proton-rich outflows can develop specifically for large black hole masses ($M_\bullet \gtrsim 100 M_\odot$) in certain accretion regimes, which may give rise to proton-rich isotopes via the $\nu$p-process.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled unexpectedly massive galaxy candidates at high redshifts, challenging standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological predictions. In this work, we study the predictions of more realistic dark matter halo models combined with modified matter power spectra for interpreting JWST observations of high-redshift galaxies. We employ three halo mass functions: the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) model and two physically motivated alternatives introduced by Del Popolo (DP1 and DP2). Our analysis of cumulative stellar mass densities at $z \simeq 8$--$10$ reveals that the standard ST mass function systematically underpredicts JWST observations, achieving marginal consistency only with high star formation efficiencies. In contrast, the DP1 and DP2 models demonstrate significantly improved agreement with observations even within standard $\Lambda$CDM, with statistical consistency within $1$--$2\sigma$ for moderate star formation efficiencies. When combined with modified power spectra, these refined halo models achieve suitable agreement with JWST data across broad parameter ranges, particularly for steeper spectral indices that amplify high-mass halo formation. Crucially, we find that moderate star formation efficiencies coupled with small-scale power enhancements provide robust reconciliation between theory and observations, eliminating the need for extreme astrophysical assumptions. Our results demonstrate that incorporating realistic halo collapse physics, often neglected in standard analyses, can substantially alleviate apparent tensions between JWST observations and $\Lambda$CDM predictions, highlighting the critical importance of small-scale structure formation physics in early cosmic epochs.
#### Lord of LRDs: Insights into a "Little Red Dot'' with a low-ionization spectrum at z = 0.1

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations have revealed a puzzling population of optically red and compact galaxies with peculiar "V"-shaped spectra at high redshift, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). Until now, most spectroscopically confirmed LRDs are found at z > 4 and it has been speculated that LRDs are tracing the early stages of black hole evolution. We report an independent rediscovery of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at z = 0.1, which shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early Universe, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of 1000-2000 km/s), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation of this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K giant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH molecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines potentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is observed in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [FeII] emission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in an JWST-selected LRD at z = 2.26. We find small but statistically significant variability in H$\alpha$ consistent with previous findings. Finally, with the new X-ray observation from NuSTAR, we confirm the extreme X-ray weakness of this LRD, which might imply Compton-thick gas obscuration with $N_{\rm H}>10^{24}~{\rm cm^{-2}}$. All evidence suggests SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 has a complex gaseous environment and the strong ionic, atomic, and molecular absorptions are hard to explain with typical stellar and AGN models.
