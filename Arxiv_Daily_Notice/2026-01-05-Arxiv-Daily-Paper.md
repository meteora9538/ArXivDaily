 - **Abstract**
 Red supergiants (RSGs) are important for our understanding of supernova progenitors, stellar populations, stellar evolution, mass loss and dust production. Extragalactic surveys of RSGs have a long history in the Local Group, but few studies exist beyond that due to the limited resolution and sensitivity of ground-based and previous space-based infrared observatories. Here we demonstrate the combined power of HST and JWST to push systematic searches of RSGs out to $\sim$20 Mpc. We introduce a catalog of 97057 RSGs -- the largest single-survey release of RSGs -- with masses $\gtrsim$10 M$_{\odot}$ in 19 galaxies from the PHANGS HST+JWST Treasury program. We use HST F814W and JWST F200W photometry to select stars as RSGs based on predicted colors and magnitudes from PARSEC isochrones. The spatial distribution of our recovered RSGs follow the familiar pattern of mostly being concentrated in active star-forming regions such as spiral arms and central starburst rings. The RSG number density on kpc-scales is strongly correlated ($r_s$$\sim$0.82) with local star-formation rate density ($\Sigma_{SFR}$) traced by extinction-corrected far-ultraviolet (FUV) from GALEX+WISE, and weakly correlated ($r_s$$\sim$0.57) with the total stellar mass density ($\Sigma_*$), traced by near-infrared emission from WISE+Spitzer. The number of RSGs per mass of stellar populations with ages 6-30 Myr (the likely age range of RSGs $>$10 M$_{\odot}$) is $\sim$1 per 10$^{3.77\pm0.27}$ M$_{\odot}$, assuming constant star-formation rates from FUV+W4. Our sample will be a useful resource for tracking progenitors and feedback sites of future supernovae in PHANGS, age-dating stellar populations, and more.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of four young open clusters, NGC 663, NGC 2301, NGC 2384, and NGC 7510, utilizing high-precision astrometric and photometric data from Gaia DR3. Cluster membership was determined using the UPMASK algorithm, resulting in probable member counts ranging from 337 to 1498 across the clusters. Bayesian MCMC isochrone fitting yielded cluster ages in the range $\log t \sim 7.0$ -$8.15$, with uncertainties of $\sim 0.11$-$0.18$. Reddening values ranged from $E(B-V)=0.093$ mag in NGC 2301 to $1.24$ mag in NGC 7510, consistent with their positions near the Galactic plane. The stellar mass function slopes ($\alpha \approx 2.00$-$2.26$) closely match the Salpeter IMF, with total stellar masses spanning nearly an order of magnitude, from $\sim 486\,M_\odot$ in NGC 2301 to $\sim 3584\,M_\odot$ in NGC 663. Dynamical relaxation times indicate that only NGC 2301 ($\tau \approx 10.00$) and NGC 2384b ($\tau \approx 2.03$) are dynamically relaxed; the others remain dynamically evolving. Orbital integrations in the MWPotential2014 model reveal nearly circular Galactic orbits with very low eccentricities ($e \approx 0.003$-$0.014$) and small vertical distances ($Z_{\rm max} < 0.142$ kpc), confirming their confinement to the thin disk. SED and kinematic analysis show that NGC 2384a and NGC 2384b are separated by $\sim 0.55$ kpc, indicating an optical pair.

 - **Abstract**
 Long gamma-ray bursts (lGRB) are produced by relativistic jets arising from the collapse of massive stars. Such progenitor environments present complex physical conditions that are challenging to model by numerical simulations. The difficulty increases when solving the accretion process and propagation of the outflows, as it requires covering distances from the black hole horizon to beyond the progenitor star. General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations provide a convenient framework to study high-luminosity jets, where magnetic flux plays an important role in the process of jet launching from the central engine. To follow the propagation of the jet through and beyond its progenitor environment, we use multi-scale simulations (i.e., AMR-based). In this work, we report results of 2.5-dimensional GRMHD simulations of a lGRB progenitor. We present highly magnetized, weakly magnetized, and non-magnetized pre-collapse stars, and discuss the observational implications for lGRB jets.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the launch of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in late 2021, our understanding of high-redshift objects has faced several upheavals. JWST has discovered much more massive galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBH) than cosmological models had expected. Furthermore, JWST observations have revealed an entirely novel population of high-redshift objects. Characterized by a dominant red rest-frame component and point-like morphology, these ``little red dots'' (LRD) have set off a flurry of observational and theoretical follow-up. The current identity of LRD is highly debated, yet falling into two main scenarios: active galactic nuclei (i.e., SMBH) or compact star-forming regions. If star-forming, LRD would represent the highest stellar densities ever observed. If SMBH, their high Eddington fractions, and already high masses, help elucidate the growth of the most massive SMBH found by JWST in the early Universe ($z \gtrsim4)$. In this mini-review, we present the observational evidence accumulated to date, including sub-millimeter probes of LRD dust masses, constraints on radio and X-ray emission from stacking, and rest-frame ultraviolet \& optical measurements provided by JWST. Furthermore, we highlight how identifying additional LRD that are truly primarily SMBH-driven may help to shed light on the formation of `overly massive' SMBH discovered by JWST within the first billion years since the Big Bang.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars are the engines of the Cosmos, shaping their environments and driving galaxy evolution across cosmic time. Yet, this general textbook picture faces many challenges when trying to turn abstract insights into quantitative predictions. Recent discoveries, such the surprisingly high metallicity and early nitrogen enrichment in high-redshift galaxies discovered by JWST, are challenging current descriptions of massive star evolution and add new pieces to a puzzle that is yet everything but complete. The oncoming era of large surveys and advances in computational modeling create the potential to reach breakthroughs in our understanding. Yet, to resolve current problems and conflicting conclusions, we will also need to reconsider what we think we know. Are the objects we observe what we think they are? Are the models we use describing what is actually going on? And what can we learn from previous misconceptions? This short review highlights major open questions from individual stars and stellar systems back to the first galaxies while also discussing two examples - the weak-wind problem as well as the different flavours and impact of Wolf-Rayet stars - where recent discoveries might point in a new direction.

 - **Abstract**
 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images of the supermassive black hole M87* depict an asymmetric ring of emission. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models of M87* and its accretion disk predict that the amplitude and location of the ring's peak brightness asymmetry should fluctuate due to turbulence in the source plasma. We compare the observed distribution of brightness asymmetry amplitudes to the simulated distribution in GRMHD models, across varying black hole spin $a_{*}$. We show that, for strongly magnetized (MAD) models, three epochs of EHT data marginally disfavor $|a_{*}| \lesssim 0.2$. This is consistent with the Blandford-Znajek model for M87's jet, which predicts that M87* should have nonzero spin. We show quantitatively how future observations could improve spin constraints, and discuss how improved spin constraints could distinguish between differing jet-launching mechanisms and black hole growth scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova (SN) 2025coe at a distance of $\sim$25 Mpc is the third-closest calcium-strong (CaST) transient. It was discovered at a large projected offset of $\sim$34 kpc from its potential host galaxy NGC 3277. Multiband photometry of SN 2025coe indicates the presence of two peaks at day $\sim$2 and day $\sim$11 after explosion. Modeling the bolometric light curve, we find that the first peak can be reproduced either by shock cooling of a compact envelope ($R_\mathrm{env}$ $\approx $6-40 $R_{\odot}$; $M_\mathrm{env}$ $\approx $0.1-0.2 $M_{\odot}$) or by interaction with close-in circumstellar material (CSM; $R_{\mathrm{CSM}} \lesssim 8 \times10^{14}$ cm), or a combination of both. The second peak is dominated by radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni ($M_{\mathrm{ej}} \approx $0.4-0.5 $M_{\odot}$; $M_{^{56}\mathrm{Ni}} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-2}$ $M_{\odot}$). SN 2025coe rapidly evolves from the photospheric phase dominated by He I P-Cygni profiles to nebular phase spectra dominated by strong [Ca II] $\lambda \lambda$7291, 7323 and weak [O I] $\lambda \lambda$6300, 6364 emission lines. Simultaneous line profile modeling of [Ca II] and [O I] at nebular phases shows that an asymmetric core-collapse explosion of a low-mass ($\lesssim$3.3 $M_{\odot}$) He-core progenitor can explain the observed line profiles. Alternatively, lack of local star formation at the site of the SN explosion combined with a low ejecta mass is also consistent with a thermonuclear explosion due to a low-mass hybrid He-C/O white dwarf + C/O white dwarf merger.

 - **Abstract**
 From the Eagle project, we study the properties of galaxies hosting AGN in cosmic voids and their surrounding structures, filaments and walls, at $z=0$, comparing them to non-AGN galaxies in similar environments. We found that the AGN fraction decreases as a function of void-centric distance, with void galaxies displaying the highest AGN fraction (12\%), and galaxies in denser environments, showing the lowest AGN fraction (6.7\%), consistent with observations. The AGN fraction is particularly high in most massive void galaxies when controlling for stellar mass. When comparing AGN host galaxies to inactive ones, we find that AGN galaxies tend to have slightly more massive SMBHs, higher specific star formation rates, and reside in higher-mass haloes at a given stellar mass than non-AGN galaxies. At $\rm M_{*} > \rm 10^{10.2} \rm M_{\odot}$, AGN hosts in voids tend to have slightly more massive SMBHs than those in denser environments. Otherwise, the AGN population does not show a clear trend in relation to the global environment. In contrast, non-AGN void galaxies host more massive SMBHs, slightly higher sSFRs, and are located in more massive haloes than those in denser environments. Analysing the recent merger histories of both AGN and non-AGN populations, we find that a larger fraction of massive AGN galaxies have undergone major mergers compared to non-AGN galaxies, regardless of environment. Notably, AGN galaxies in voids show a higher frequency of recent mergers, especially major mergers, than their counterparts in other environments, especially at high stellar mass. Our results suggest that the evolution of SMBHs in voids is closely related to that of their host galaxies and their surrounding environment, while the most recent AGN activity is more strongly linked to recent interactions.
#### The SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey: The morphologies of clusters of galaxies: II. The intrinsic distributions of morphological parameters

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray selected surveys of clusters of galaxies have been reported to contain more regular cool core clusters compared to samples selected using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. Morphology population studies on X-ray selected clusters will be biased without taking into account selection, as cool cores are more easily detected at low redshifts, but can be mistaken for point sources at high redshift. eROSITA, aboard SRG, found over 12000 optically-identified clusters in its first survey, eRASS1. Taking account of the selection function obtained from simulations, we obtain using a Bayesian framework the intrinsic distribution of morphological parameters, including the concentration, central density, cuspiness, ellipticity and slosh. We construct scaling relations for the parameters as a function of redshift (z) and luminosity (LX), and study their distribution within z or LX bins. We find that the concentration in a scaled aperture evolves positively with LX, similarly to the central scaled density, and negatively with z. When using a fixed aperture, its evolution with LX is lower, but also dependent on the choice of cluster centre. The mean ellipticity does not significantly evolve with z or LX. eRASS1 clusters show indications of higher concentrations compared to SZ-selected objects, even after taking account the selection; this suggests that if our X-ray selection model is correct SZ-selected clusters may also suffer from morphological selection effects. We compare different parameter distribution models in bins of z and LX. The distribution of concentration and ellipticity is generally consistent with a normal one, but other parameters such as the central density and cuspiness strongly favour more complex distributions. However, modelling of all clusters as a single population generally prefers non-normal distributions. [abridged]
#### Hadronic Origin of Sub-PeV Gamma-Ray Emission from LHAASO J0621+3755

 - **Abstract**
 Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays are primarily estimated to arise from high-energy electromagnetic interactions in pulsars and their halo through electron inverse Compton (IC) scattering. Hadronic channels like neutral pion decay have also been proposed to produce TeV-PeV gamma rays from the Pulsar halo. The neutral pions are expected to be generated from cosmic ray (CR) protons interacting with the ambient/cloud. The recent observations of sub-PeV gamma rays from the halo of pulsar PSR J0622+3749 by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory Kilometre-Square Array (LHAASO-KM2A) detector provide a platform to explore different channels of their production. Previous studies support consistency with the leptonic modeling of the halo, which attributes its origin to slow diffusion in the interstellar medium. In this work, we investigated the possibility of proton-proton channel as the origin of these photons. To explain the observed gamma rays with energy $\sim 4$ TeV by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) telescope till 200 TeV by the LHAASO observatory, one requires the CR proton luminosity to be $\eta_p\sim 0.1$ of the pulsar PSR J0622+3749 spin-down luminosity. In this case, we have considered the protons propagating in a one-zone superdiffusion environment, specifically $\alpha = 1$ in a cloud of gas density 1 per cm$^{3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Complex organic molecules (COMs), the building blocks of life, have been extensively detected under various physical conditions, from quiescent clouds to star-forming regions. They therefore serve as excellent tracers for the local physical and chemical properties of these environments. Proper models that are capable of grasping the formation and destruction of COMs are crucial to understanding observations. However, given that distinct COMs may be detected from different locations and at varying times, we improve UCLCHEM - a gas-grain chemical code - to a one-dimensional, time-dependent model, tailored to protostars. In this update, we examine two stages of a protostar: the prestellar and heating stages, incorporating a simple radiative mechanism for both the internal and external radiation fields of the cloud. This approach relies on the key assumption that the dust and gas temperatures are completely coupled. Ultimately, we implement an updated version of our model to interpret observations obtained through both single-dish and interferometry under varying conditions, including a SgrB2(N1) hot core, massive Galactic clumps and a hot core in Orion. We show that our model could reproduce these observations well, highlighting that some COMs are positioned at a higher temperature in the envelope, whereas others are from the lower temperature, potentially leading to misinterpretation when using a single-point model. In a particular case of SgrB2(N1), the best model indicates that the cosmic-ray ionisation rate significantly exceeds the value typically used for the standard interstellar medium. Our model shows as an efficient computational tool particularly useful for better insights into observations of COMs.
