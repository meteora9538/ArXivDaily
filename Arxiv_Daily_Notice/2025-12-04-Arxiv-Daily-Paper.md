 - **Abstract**
 Observations of massive star-forming regions show that classical stellar wind models over-predict the luminosity of the X-ray emitting gas, indicating a significant fraction of wind energy is lost. In this paper, we present a multi-wavelength analysis of the giant HII region 30 Doradus and its central star cluster R136 using 2 Ms of Chandra X-ray Observatory data, combined with James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope imaging and Spitzer spectral-energy distributions, to investigate how the hot gas energy is lost through turbulent mixing, radiative cooling, and physical leakage. We compare the spatial and spectral properties of the hot gas with those of the warm ionized gas and dust. We find no significant correlation between the dust and hot gas temperatures, suggesting they are not directly coupled and that the dust resides in the swept-up shells where it is heated radiatively. H$\alpha$ and X-ray surface brightness profiles show that the X-rays peak interior to the H$\alpha$ shells, demonstrating partial confinement of the hot gas. The fragmented shell structure and bright X-ray interior that declines near the H$\alpha$ shell reflect efficient cooling from turbulent mixing at the hot-cold interface. We compare against recent simulations of stellar-feedback driven bubbles which have broad agreement with the morphology of the X-ray and H$\alpha$ emission, but the simulations produce a dip in the interior X-ray surface brightness and a lack of hard X-rays compared to the observations. These differences may suggest thermal conduction is important as mass-loading of the hot bubble could reproduce the X-ray observables.

 - **Abstract**
 Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a newly identified class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) uncovered by JWST deep surveys. Their enigmatic properties challenge the canonical AGN paradigm and have stimulated ideas on early massive black hole (BH) formation. In this review, we summarize how early BHs shape the characteristic features of LRDs, how their nuclear environments differ from those of normal AGNs, and how future observations can distinguish between competing scenarios. Our main conclusions are as follows: (1) LRDs show broad-line emission consistent with mass accretion onto BHs with $M_{\rm BH}\simeq 10^{6-7}~M_\odot$, suggesting that AGN activity is a plausible origin of their dominant red optical emission. (2) Stellar components can reproduce the continuum energetics through dusty star formation. However, the required stellar mass would be too large to remain consistent with other LRD properties. Therefore, a purely stellar origin is unlikely to be the dominant power source, although star formation may still contribute to the UV emission. (3) The coexistence of broad-line emission with Balmer absorption and break features on LRD spectra, neither of which can be explained by stellar populations, suggests that nuclear BHs are enshrouded by dense gas with a high covering fraction. (4) Gas-enshrouded AGNs can produce red optical spectra without requiring dust reddening through a combination of gas attenuation and thermal self-emission with an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}\simeq 5000~{\rm K}$, which also accounts for the flat infrared continuum. (5) From the spectral features and redshift evolution, LRDs are likely a transient phase in early BH growth, possibly the first accretion episodes of newborn BHs. (6) Testing models for LRD spectra and origins through time variability, ionizing sources, post-LRD objects, and low-redshift analogs is particularly promising.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasars at the dawn of Cosmic Time ($z>6$) are fundamental probes to investigate the early co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxy. Nevertheless, their infrared spectral energy distribution remains at the present time poorly constrained, due to the limited photometric coverage probing the far-infrared wavelength range where the dust modified black-body is expected to peak ($\sim80$ $\mathrm{\mu m}$). Here we present a study of the high-frequency dust emission via a dedicated ALMA Band 8 ($\sim$400 GHz) campaign targeting 11 quasar host galaxies at $6<z<7$. Combined with archival observations in other ALMA bands, this program enables a detailed characterization of their infrared emission, allowing for the derivation of dust masses ($M_{d}$), dust emissivity indexes ($\beta$), dust temperatures ($T_{d}$), infrared luminosities ($L_{IR}$), and associated star formation rates (SFRs). Our analysis confirms that dust temperature is on average higher in this sample (34-65 K) if compared to local main-sequence galaxies' values, and that this finding can be linked to the increased star formation efficiency we derive in our work, as also suggested by the [CII]$_{158\mu m}$ deficit. Most remarkably, we note that the average value of $T_d$ of this sample doesn't differ from the one that is observed in luminous, ultra-luminous and hyper-luminous infrared galaxies at different redshifts that show no signs of hosting a quasar. Finally, our findings suggest that the presence of a bright AGN does not significantly bias the derived infrared properties, although further high-frequency, high-spatial resolution observations might reveal more subtle impacts on sub-kiloparsec scales.
#### On the Origin of Gas-stripping of Galaxies in Group Environments

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how low-mass group environments ($M_{\rm vir} \sim 10^{12-13}\,M_{\odot}$) influence the gas content of their satellite galaxies with $M_* > 10^{7}\,M_{\odot}$ using the \NHtwo\ simulation. Many satellite galaxies preserve substantial gas reservoirs, yet show signs of outer gas stripping, reminiscent of jellyfish galaxies in clusters. In contrast, low-mass satellites ($<10^8 \, M_{\odot}$) are largely gas-deficient, and some of them undergo gas removal within their host group by external pressure triggered by either galaxy interactions or ram pressure exerted by the hot intragroup medium. Complete gas removal in these satellite galaxies occurs when the external hydrodynamic pressure exceeds the gravitational restoring force, typically due to stochastic events such as galaxy-galaxy interaction or nearby galactic outflows. The emergence of a characteristic stellar mass of $10^8 \, M_{\odot}$ which determines the efficiency of gas removal in groups, likely reflects the differing scaling relations of external pressure with halo mass and gravitational restoring force with stellar mass. While tidal interactions can be a significant cause of gas loss in satellite galaxies, those severe enough to affect the gas content in the central regions typically lead to the complete disruption of the galaxy. Consequently, gas loss driven by tidal interactions may be underestimated in the studies focusing solely on surviving galaxies. Group environments, where environmental effects are weaker and satellite galaxies tend to have lower restoring forces due to their low masses, exhibit complex manifestations of gas loss that are not seen in more massive environments such as clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has revealed unexpectedly bright galaxies in the first 500 Myr after the Big Bang. Their overabundance suggests that they are preferentially observed during burst phases, where their star formation rates increase dramatically. In cosmological simulations, such bursts transition into short ($\approx 40$ Myr) periods without star formation or naps. Using JWST/NIRCam medium-band observations, we report the discovery of the galaxy CANUCS-A370-2228423 ($z = 5.95 \pm 0.06$, $\log(M_\ast/M_{\odot}) = 9.14 \pm 0.09$), dubbed The Sleeper. Its star formation history indicates rapid assembly in the first 300 Myr ($z \gtrsim 14$), where it formed a $\log(M_\ast/M_{\odot}) = 8.7^{+0.3}_{-0.4}\ M_{\odot}$ progenitor, comparable in stellar mass to the few spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at those redshifts. Unexpectedly, this is followed by several hundred million years of suppressed star formation, in stark contrast to nappers. This results in a remarkably strong hydrogen Balmer break, exceeding that of any galaxy observed within the first billion years by a factor of $\approx 3$. Furthermore, Sleeper-like systems are overabundant in the observed survey volume compared to theory, as the probability of finding such galaxies in simulations is $< 0.2\%$. The discovery of The Sleeper therefore disrupts the current narrative that all luminous galaxies in the first few hundred million years grow into massive descendants. Instead it presents an alternative evolutionary pathway in which these unusually luminous galaxies fade into inefficient dwarfs after an early starburst, revealing greater diversity in the first stages of galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernovae (SNe) enrich and energize the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) and are a key mechanism in the galaxy feedback cycle. The heating of the ISM by supernova shocks, and its subsequent cooling is critical to future star formation. The cooling of the diffuse shock-heated ISM is dominated by ultraviolet (UV) emission lines. These cooling regions and interfaces have complex spatial structure on sub-parsec scales. Mapping this cooling process is essential to understanding the feedback cycle of galaxies, a major goal of the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey. The Supernova remnants and Proxies for ReIonization Testbed Experiment (SPRITE) CubeSat Mission will house the first long-slit orbital spectrograph with sub-arcminute angular resolution covering far ultraviolet wavelengths (FUV; 1000 - 1750 angstroms) and access to the Lyman UV (lambda < 1216 angstroms). SPRITE aims to provide new insights into the stellar feedback that drives galaxy evolution by mapping key FUV emission lines at the interaction lines between supernova remnants (SNRs) and the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). SPRITE will also measure the ionizing escape from approximately 50 low-redshift (0.16 < z < 0.4) star-forming galaxies. Current models predict SPRITE capable of detecting strong O VI, O IV], and C IV emission lines with angular resolution from 10 - 20 arcseconds. The SPRITE SNR survey will use push-broom mapping of its long-slit on extended sources to produce the first large sample of sub-arcminute 3D data cubes of extended sources in the FUV. In this paper, we present simulated SPRITE observations of Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) SNRs to demonstrate the efficacy of the SPRITE instrument ahead of launch and instrument commissioning. These models serve as critical planning tools and incorporate the final pre-flight predicted performance of the instrument and the early extended source data reduction pipeline.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-light bosonic dark matter (ULDM) is an interesting and promising dark matter candidate. While the wave-like nature of ULDM has been widely studied in the literature, we explore another distinctive feature of ULDM as Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) in this paper: the emergence of vortices in a rotating BEC-ULDM halos. Using numerical solution of the GPP equation, we demonstrate that a lattice of vortices ,underdensity columns that carry angular momentum, naturally forms in a ULDM halo under conditions similar to those of the Milky Way. Furthermore, we study the gravitational lensing by these vortices as a possible observational signature of BEC-ULDM. If the vortices are large enough and the halo's rotational axis align with the line of sight, regularly separated brightness anomalies can be produced, providing strong evidence for BEC-ULDM.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effects of the nearby interstellar medium (ISM) on the locally measured cosmic-ray (CR) spectra. Using the GALPROP code we explore how variations in the local gas and source distributions affect spectral features at low energies. Comparing with recent Voyager 1 data taken in the local ISM, we show that for a realistic interstellar gas distribution, the nearest source of the low energy CR particles observed nearby the Solar system is constrained to be within the range ~150-200 pc distant. We find that the modelling supports the conclusion of Cummings et al. (2025) that there is a significant fraction of primary Boron in its observed spectrum at low energies. Our study shows that detailed modelling of the immediate Galactic environment is required to robustly infer Galactic CR propagation parameters from local measurements, and that accounting for nearby ISM structure can alleviate tensions between direct CR data and global propagation models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new Chandra observations of seven luminous quasars at $z>6.5$. Combined with archival Chandra observations of all other known quasars, they form nearly complete X-ray observations of all currently known $z\sim7$ quasars with $M_{1450}<-26.5$, except for J0313$-$1806 at $z=7.642$ and J0910$-$0414 at $z=6.636$. Together with existing ground-based NIR spectroscopy and ALMA observations, we investigate the correlations between X-ray emission (the X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and the optical/UV-to-X-ray spectral slope $\alpha_{\rm OX}$) and various quasar properties (rest-UV luminosity $L_{\mathrm{2500\ \mathring{A}}}$, bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm bol}$, C IV blueshift, and infrared luminosity $L_{\rm IR}$). We find most $z>6.5$ quasars follow a similar $\alpha_{\rm OX}-L_{\mathrm{2500\ \mathring{A}}}$ relation as $z\sim1-6$ quasars, but also display a large scatter. We find a potential correlation between $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ and the C IV blueshift, suggesting a soft optical/UV-to-X-ray SED shape is frequently associated with fast disk winds. Furthermore, we analyze the X-ray spectrum of 11 quasars at $z>6.5$ with Chandra detection, and find the best-fit photon index $\Gamma$ is $2.41\pm0.27$, which is likely driven by high accretion rates of $z>6.5$ quasars. In addition, we find there are no significant correlations between either $L_{\rm X}$ and $L_{\rm IR}$, nor $L_{\rm bol}$ and $L_{\rm IR}$, suggesting no strong correlations between quasar luminosity and star formation luminosity for the most luminous quasars at $z>6.5$.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents an analysis of noise transients observed in LIGO data during the first part of the fourth observing run, using the unsupervised machine learning technique t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to examine the behavior of glitch groups. Based on the t-SNE output, we apply Agglomerative Clustering in combination with the Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of groups. We then track these groups over time and investigate correlations between their occurrence and environmental or instrumental conditions. At the Livingston observatory, the most common glitches during O4a were seasonal and associated with ground motion, whereas at Hanford, the most prevalent glitches were related to instrumental conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale magnetic fields are relevant for a number of dynamical processes in accretion disks, including driving turbulence, reconnection events, and launching outflows. Numerical simulations have indicated that the initial strengths and configurations of the large-scale magnetic fields have a direct imprint on the outcome of an accretion disk evolution. To facilitate future self-consistent simulations that include intrinsic dynamo processes, we derive and implement a subgrid model of a helical large-scale dynamo with dynamical quenching in general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamical simulations of geometrically thin accretion disks. By incorporating previous numerical and analytical results of helical dynamos, our model features only one input parameter, the viscosity parameter $\alpha_\text{SS}$. We demonstrate that our model can reproduce butterfly diagrams seen in previous local and global simulations. With rather aggressive parameter choice of $\alpha_\text{SS}=0.02$ and black hole spin $a_\text{BH}=0.9375$, our thin-disk model launches weak collimated polar outflows with Lorentz factor $\simeq 1.2$, but no polar outflow is present with less vigorous turbulence or less positive $a_\text{BH}$. With negative $a_\text{BH}$, we find the field configurations to appear more similar to Newtonian cases, whereas for positive $a_\text{BH}$, the poloidal field loops become distorted and the cycle period becomes sporadic or even disappears. Moreover, we demonstrate how $\alpha_\text{SS}$ can avoid to be prescribed and instead be determined by the local plasma beta. Such a fully dynamical subgrid dynamo allows for self-consistent amplification of the large-scale magnetic fields.
#### Neutrino-dominated relativistic shocked accretion flow around rotating black hole: implications for short gamma-ray bursts

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the physical properties of the central engine powering gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), modelled as a stellar-mass black hole accreting via a neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF). By solving the governing hydrodynamic equations, we obtain global transonic NDAF solutions featuring shock transitions and examine their role in powering GRB energetics. The NDAF solutions are explored over a broad range of black hole parameters, including its mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and spin ($a_{\rm k}$), and accretion rate ($\dot{M}$). We find that shocked NDAFs can naturally account for the observed diversity in GRB energy output. Incorporating results from numerical simulations of binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers, we estimate the remnant black hole mass and spin parameters for the predicted range of post-merger disk mass ($M_{\rm disk}$). Our analysis reveals that small-mass black holes with relatively low spin values can adequately reproduce the luminosities of short GRBs (SGRBs), whereas identical GRB luminosities can also be achieved for more massive black holes possessing higher spin values. Finally, we uncover a robust correlation between the black hole spin and disk mass such that $M_{\rm disk}$ decreases with increasing $a_{\rm k}$, remaining largely independent of the black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) powering GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond-duration extragalactic radio transients that probe extreme astrophysical environments. Many FRBs exhibit multi-component structures, which encode information about their emission mechanisms or progenitor systems and thus provide important clues to their origins. In this work, we systematically analyze the burst morphology of FRB 20190520B and compare component distributions across four active FRBs observed with FAST: FRB 20121102A, FRB 20190520B, FRB 20201124A, and FRB 20240114A. We find that multi-component burst-clusters show spectral properties similar to single-peak bursts, and no periodicity is detected in their temporal behavior. The component-count distributions follow a power law, revealing scale-free behavior consistent with self-organized criticality (SOC) processes. Multi-component clusters account for 12-30% of all detected bursts, regardless of source activity, providing new insights into burst-to-burst variability and the physical processes driving FRB emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the properties of the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM) of massive galaxies and their cosmic evolution. By using the year 1 dataset of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and QSOs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey, we construct a sample of approximately 600,000 galaxy-quasar pairs and measure the radial distribution and kinematics of the cool gas traced by Mg II absorption lines as a function of galaxy properties from redshift 0.4 to redshift 1.2. Our results show that the covering fraction of the cool gas around LRGs increases with redshift, following a trend similar to the global evolution of galaxy star formation rate. At small radii (< 0.3rvir), the covering fraction anti-correlates with stellar mass, suggesting that mass-dependent processes suppress the cool gas content in the inner region. In addition, we measure the gas dispersion by modeling the velocity distribution of absorbers with a narrow and a broad components -- sigma_n ~ 60 and sigma_b ~ 380 km/s -- and quantify their relative contributions. The results show that the broad component becomes more prominent in the outer region, and its relative importance in the central region grows with increasing stellar mass. Finally, we discuss possible origins of the cool gas around massive galaxies, including the contribution of satellite galaxies and the precipitation scenario.
#### X TrA through the eyes of MATISSE: More evidence of clumpy molecular layers around C-type asymptotic giant branch stars

 Aims. The goal of this study is to further the understanding of the wind formation mechanism in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars through the analysis of the close environment (within a few stellar radii) of the carbon star X TrA. Methods. X TrA was observed for the first time with the Mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment instrument (MATISSE) in the L and N bands in low spectral resolution mode (R=30), and its close surroundings were mapped in specific wavelength ranges corresponding to specific molecules ($C_2H_2$ and HCN, at 3.1 and 3.8 $\mu$m) and dust (amorphous carbon and, for example, Sic at 11.3 $\mu$m), via image reconstruction techniques. Results. The angular diameter of the star ranges from 10 mas in the L band pseudo-continuum (3.5 $\mu$m) to 20 mas at 3.1 and 11.3 $\mu$m. The reconstructed images show some mild elongated features (along the east-west direction) and asymmetric protrusions, which are most evident around 3.1 $\mu$m. Imaging results highlight the clumpy nature of the circumstellar environment, starting from the photospheric region up to more distant layers. Conclusions. The angular diameters found for X TrA in the image data are in agreement with previous photospheric diameter estimates (following VLTI/MIDI 8-13 $\mu$m observations), and their wavelength dependence is similar to values found for other carbon stars observed with MATISSE (R Scl and V Hya). The 3.1 $\mu$m images presented here show highly asymmetric features, another case of a C-rich star with irregular morphologies close to the stellar disk; this supports the notion that the $C_2H_2+HCN$ abundance distribution usually originates from a clumpy layer around carbon stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Transiting circumbinary planets (CBPs) are conspicuously rare, and entirely absent around stellar binaries with periods $\leq 7$ days. Here, we exploit a secular resonance to stimulate the orbit of a CBP into strong, disruptive interactions with the host binary. The process requires no tertiary companion and is triggered when the general-relativistic precession of a tightening binary matches the Newtonian precession it induces in its companion planet. Adiabatic capture in this resonance sees the binary draining angular momentum from the CBP's orbit which grows steadily in eccentricity until destabilization, and eventual ejection or engulfment. We map this resonance in phase space, then investigate the dynamical outcomes of encounter in the course of tidally shrinking binaries. With the help of orbit averaged simulations of a suite of systems, we find that, around tightening binaries: eight out of ten CBPs encounter and are captured in the resonance; three out of four are `destroyed'; and survivors lurk on remote, low-transit-probability orbits. This suggests that the very process which forms tight binaries effectively clears the region where transiting CBPs could reside.

 - **Abstract**
 The primordial structure of Jupiter remains uncertain, yet it holds vital clues on the planet's formation and early evolution. Recent work used dynamical constraints from Jupiter's inner moons to determine its primordial state, thereby providing a novel, formation-era anchor point for interior modeling. Building on this approach, we combine these dynamical constraints with thermal evolution simulations to investigate which primordial structures are consistent with present-day Jupiter. We present 4,250 evolutionary models of the planetary structure, including compositional mixing and helium phase separation, spanning a broad range of initial entropies and composition profiles. We find that Jupiter's present-day structure is best explained by a warm ($4.98_{-2.57}^{+3.00}\, \mathrm{k_B\, m_u^{-1}}$), metal-rich dilute core inherited from formation. To simultaneously satisfy constraints on Jupiter's primordial spin, however, its envelope must have been significantly warmer ($9.32_{-0.58}^{+0.48}\, \mathrm{k_B\, m_u^{-1}}$) at the time of disk dispersal. We determine Jupiter's primordial radius to be $1.89_{-0.49}^{+0.40}\, \mathrm{R_J}$. These results provide new constraints on Jupiter's formation, suggesting that most heavy elements were accreted early during runaway gas accretion, and placing bounds on the energy dissipated during the accretion shock.

 - **Abstract**
 Nuclear star clusters (NSC) are dense and compact stellar systems, of sizes of few parsecs, located at galactic centers. Their properties and formation mechanisms seem to be tightly linked to the evolution of the host galaxy, with potentially different formation channels for late- and early-type galaxies (respectively, LTGs and ETGs). While most observations target ETGs, here we focus on the NSC in M 74 (NGC 628), a relatively massive, gas-rich and star-forming spiral galaxy, part of the PHANGS survey. We analyzed the central arcmin of the PHANGS-MUSE mosaic, in which the NSC is not spatially resolved. We performed a two-dimensional spectro-photometric decomposition of the MUSE cube, employing a modified version of the C2D code, to disentangle the NSC from the host galaxy. Here we used three components: a bulge, a disk and a NSC approximated to the point spread function (PSF), obtaining three data cubes, one for each component. This allowed us to extract separately the age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] abundance for the NSC and the host galaxy. Our results show a very old and metal-poor NSC, in contrast to the surrounding regions. While similar properties were found in NSCs hosted by galaxies of different masses and/or morphological types from M 74, they are somewhat unexpected for a relatively massive star-forming spiral galaxy. The spatially resolved stellar populations of the host galaxy display much younger (light-weighted) ages and higher metallicities, especially in the central region (${\sim}500$ pc) surrounding the NSC. This suggests that this NSC formed a long time ago, and evolved passively until today, without any further growth. Our results show that the NSC was not involved in the active recent star-formation history of its host galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Although historically classified into discrete subclasses, there is growing evidence that indicates that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) categories often overlap, reflecting continuous variations in progenitor structure, mass-loss history, and circumstellar environments rather than strictly distinct channels. In this review, we explore the proposed continua that link hydrogen-rich Type II SNe to stripped-envelope explosions (IIb-Ib-Ic), and that extend further into interaction-dominated and superluminous events. We discuss the physical processes-stellar winds, binary interaction, eruptive outbursts, and circumstellar interaction-that may produce graded outcomes across classes, while highlighting where observational evidence supports or challenges smooth transitions. We propose that CCSNe are better viewed as a multidimensional continuum of explosion outcomes, where traditional subclasses act as reference points rather than strict boundaries. Future progress will rely on large, homogeneous datasets and advanced modeling to disentangle true evolutionary sequences from apparent overlaps, ultimately connecting progenitor pathways to the observed diversity of explosions
#### The Nature of Nitrogen Enhanced High Redshift Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations have revealed a population of high-redshift galaxies ($z\gtrsim5$) exhibiting unexpectedly bright ultraviolet (UV) nitrogen emission lines. The strong N III] and N IV] features imply nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios (N/O) as high as $-0.8 \lesssim \log(\mathrm{N/O}) \lesssim 0.4$ in these low-metallicity galaxies ($12+\log(\mathrm{O/H}) \lesssim 8.2$), compared to the local value of $\log(\mathrm{N/O})\approx-1.5$. If confirmed, this level of nitrogen enrichment challenges existing models of nucleosynthesis and galaxy evolution. However, the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can affect spectral diagnostics, and previous studies often excluded AGN contamination using photoionization models based on local N/O ratios. In this work, we compare nitrogen-enhanced AGN and H II region models to observed spectra of eight high-redshift galaxies to constrain their nitrogen abundance, excitation source, gas-phase metallicity, ionization parameter, and gas pressure, simultaneously. We find seven galaxies (GHZ9, GS 3073, GN-z9p4, CEERS-1019, GHZ2, GN-z11, and GS-z9-0) are best described by nitrogen-enhanced AGN models, while RXCJ2248-ID is best reproduced by the nitrogen-enhanced H II model. The presence of AGN does not significantly impact ($\lesssim0.1\,$dex) the derived N/O ratio. We also find that equivalent width (EW)-based diagrams are the most robust UV diagnostic diagrams to distinguish AGNs and star-forming galaxies for situations where the nitrogen abundance is varying. All nitrogen-enhanced galaxies have moderate to high gas pressure ($7.0\leq\log (P/k)\leq9.8$) and high ionization parameter ($\log(U)\gtrsim-2.0$), indicating a dense and compact environment. We suggest that super star clusters containing Wolf-Rayet stars and massive stars are the most likely contributors to the elevated nitrogen abundance in these galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The mid-infrared spectrum of star-forming, high metallicity galaxies is dominated by emission features from aromatic and aliphatic bonds in small carbonaceous dust grains, often referred to as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In metal-poor galaxies, the abundance of PAHs relative to the total dust sharply declines, but the origin of this deficit is unknown. We present JWST observations that detect and resolve emission from PAHs in the 7% Solar metallicity galaxy Sextans A, representing the lowest metallicity detection of PAH emission to date. In contrast to higher metallicity galaxies, the clumps of PAH emission are compact (0.5-1.5'' or 3-10 pc), which explains why PAH emission evaded detection by lower resolution instruments like Spitzer. Ratios between the 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 $\mu$m PAH features indicate that the PAH grains in Sextans A are small and neutral, with no evidence of significant processing from the hard radiation fields within the galaxy. These results favor inhibited grain growth over enhanced destruction as the origin of the low PAH abundance in Sextans A. The compact clumps of PAH emission are likely active sites of in-situ PAH growth within a dense, well-shielded phase of the interstellar medium. Our results show that PAHs can form and survive in extremely metal-poor environments common early in the evolution of the Universe.
