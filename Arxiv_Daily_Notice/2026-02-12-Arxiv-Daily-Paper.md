 - **Abstract**
 Solar vortices are fundamental components of solar atmospheric dynamics, serving as natural laboratories for magnetic field twisting, energy concentration and transport, wave guidance, and plasma coupling across atmospheric layers. Numerical and observational studies show that solar vortices are intimately connected to key physical processes including magnetic reconnection, atmospheric heating, turbulence, and wave generation. This white paper, prepared for the UK Space Frontiers 2035 call, outline five high-priority scientific questions addressing vortex generation mechanisms, cross-layer coupling, magnetic restructuring, collective wave-guidance structures, and their role in triggering explosive events and modulating the solar wind. Key observations and capabilities required to make significant advancements over the coming decade are identified. The UK solar physics community has established world-leading expertise in vortex dynamics, combining strengths in high-resolution observations, MHD turbulence theory, numerical modelling, and space instrumentation. UK researchers have made foundational contributions to Solar Orbiter, delivered critical systems for DKIST, and maintain active involvement in MUSE and SOLAR-C EUVST missions. Our technical approach centres on developing next-generation instrumentation: a multi-band, space-qualified system employing four tunable Fabry-Pérot Interferometers providing diffraction-limited, high-cadence spectropolarimetric coverage from the deep photosphere to the low corona. This capability will be validated through a staged mission architecture beginning with balloon-borne demonstrators. Continuing this effort over the coming decade is vital to maintain UK leadership in this field and achieve the goals of roadmap for solar system research.

 - **Abstract**
 The initial mass function (IMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses in a population of newly born stars and is amongst the most fundamental concepts in astrophysics. It is not only the direct result of the star formation process but it also explains the evolution of galaxies' luminosities, metal yields, star-formation efficiencies, and supernova production rates. Because most stars exist in binary systems, however, a full statistical account of stellar mass requires not the IMF but rather the joint distribution of a binary population's primary- and secondary-star masses. This joint distribution must respect the IMF of the stars from which the population has been assembled as well as the distribution of mass ratios that results from the assembly mechanism. Despite its importance, this joint distribution is known only in the case of random pairing. Here we present a method for constructing it in the general case. We also illustrate the use of our method by recovering the known result for random pairing and by finding the previously unknown result for uniform pairing.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present an updated prescription of contemporary tidal dissipation theory adapted for rapid binary population synthesis. Our simplified expressions encode the dependence of tidal dissipation on stellar structure, stratification, and tidal forcing frequency, while remaining computationally efficient. We implement these prescriptions in the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS, and demonstrate the self-consistent coupling of tides with stellar evolution and binary properties such as orbital periods, spins, and eccentricities for several representative binary systems. When compared with commonly used tidal prescriptions, our equilibrium tidal dissipation efficiencies can be stronger by 1-2 orders of magnitude for low mass main sequence and giant type stars, and dynamical tides can be stronger by 1-7 orders of magnitude due to the explicit dependence on internal stellar structure and the presence of inertial wave dissipation. Despite our simplistic approach, our models agree with detailed stellar simulations to within an order of magnitude across tidal dissipation mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar collisions can occur frequently in dense cluster environments, and play a crucial role in producing exotic phenomena from blue stragglers in globular clusters to high-energy transients in galactic nuclei. Successive collisions and mergers of massive stars could also lead to the formation of massive black holes, serving as seeds for supermassive black hole in the early universe. While analytic fitting formulae exist for predicting collision outcomes, they do not generalize across different energy scales or stellar evolutionary phases. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations are often used to compute the outcomes of stellar collisions, but, even at low resolution, their computational cost makes running on-the-fly calculations during an $N$-body simulation quite challenging. Here we present a new grid of $27,720$ SPH calculations of main-sequence star collisions, spanning a wide range of masses, ages, relative velocities, and impact parameters. Using this grid, we train machine learning models to predict both collision outcomes (merger vs disruption, or flyby) and final remnant masses. We compare the performance of nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks, achieving classification balanced accuracy of $98.4\%$, and regression relative errors as low as $0.11\%$ and $0.15\%$ for the final stars $1$ and $2$, respectively. We make our trained models publicly available as part of the package collAIder, enabling rapid predictions of stellar collision outcomes in $N$-body models of dense star cluster dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how different galaxy formation models impact the stellar properties of brightest group galaxies (BGGs) in four cosmological simulations: ROMULUS, SIMBA, SIMBA-C, and OBSIDIAN. The stellar masses, specific star formation rates, and mass-weighted stellar ages of the simulated BGGs are analysed alongside those of observed BGGs from X-ray-selected galaxy groups in the COSMOS field. We find that the global properties and underlying evolutionary pathways of simulated BGG populations are strongly impacted by the strength and mechanism of their respective active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback models, which play a critical role in regulating the growth of massive galaxies. OBSIDIAN's sophisticated three-regime AGN feedback model achieves the highest overall agreement with COSMOS observations, matching stellar property distributions, quenched fractions, and the evolution of star formation in increasingly massive systems. We find evidence suggesting that BGG populations of OBSIDIAN and COSMOS undergo a gradual decline in star formation with stellar mass, in contrast to SIMBA and SIMBA-C, which display rapid quenching linked to the onset of powerful AGN jet feedback. By comparison, ROMULUS produces highly star-forming, under-quenched BGGs due to the inefficiency of its thermal AGN feedback in preventing cooling flows from fuelling BGG growth. The success of the OBSIDIAN simulation demonstrates the importance of physically motivated subgrid prescriptions for realistically capturing the processes that shape BGGs and their dynamic group environments.
#### Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and $ρ$ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU) II: Two Young Bound Companions to Ophiuchus Stars

 - **Abstract**
 We present the second set of discoveries from Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and $\rho$ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU), an adaptive optics survey of young stars in the Taurus and $\rho$ Oph star-forming regions using Keck/NIRC2 in conjunction with the Keck infrared pyramid wavefront sensor. We have discovered two faint comoving companions to young stars ISO-Oph 96 and 2MASS J16262785-2625152. The companion to ISO-Oph 96, KOINTREAU-3b, is at a projected separation of 340 au (2.49"). Using our NIRC2 photometry and evolutionary models, and assuming that the companion has the same extinction as its host star, we infer that KOINTREAU-3b has a mass of $3.4\pm0.7$ M$_{\rm Jup}$. The companion to 2MASS J16262785-2625152, KOINTREAU-4b, has a projected separation of 180 au (1.25") and could have a mass of either $11.5^{+1.2}_{-1.6}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$ or $15.3^{+0.7}_{-0.8}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$, depending on whether the host star is a member of $\rho$ Oph or Upper Sco.

 - **Abstract**
 'Spider' binary systems - black widow and redback compact binaries differentiated by their companion's mass and nature - are an important type of pulsar system exhibiting a rich empirical phenomenology, including radio eclipses, optical light curves from a heated companion, as well as non-thermal X-ray and GeV orbital light curves and spectra. Multi-wavelength observations have now resulted in the detection of >~50 of these systems in which a millisecond pulsar heats and ablates its low-mass companion via its intense pulsar wind. Broadband observations have established the presence of relativistic leptons that have been accelerated in the pulsar magnetosphere and near the intrabinary shock, as well as a hot companion, presenting an ideal environment for the creation of orbitally-modulated inverse Compton fluxes that should be within reach of current and future Cherenkov telescopes. We have included an updated synchrotron kernel, different parametric injection spectral shapes, and several intrabinary shock geometries in our emission code to improve our predictions of the expected TeV signatures from spider binaries. Our updated phase-dependent spectral and energy-dependent light curve outputs may aid in constraining particle energetics, wind properties, shock geometry, and system inclination of several spider binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational extragalactic catalogs over wide sky areas are essential for uncovering the large-scale structure of the Universe. They allow, among others, cosmological studies and density analyses that impose strong constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution. By taking advantage of the wide field images and the 12 optical bands of the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS), we aim at providing a catalog of galaxies located, in projection, towards the Fornax galaxy cluster, within $\sim$ 5 virial radii in right ascension (R.A.) and $\sim$ 3 virial radius in declination (Dec) around NGC,1399, the dominant galaxy of the cluster. Such a catalog will allow unprecedented large-scale structure studies in that sky region. Supervised deep learning algorithms have been developed, utilizing neural networks complemented with dimensionality reduction techniques, to classify and separate spurious objects, stars and galaxies in a photometric catalog previously built for the S-PLUS Fornax Project (S+FP). That catalog was built using a combination of SExtractor configurations optimized for galaxy detection and characterization. A catalog of 119,580 galaxies was obtained in the direction of the Fornax cluster containing photometric information in the 12 optical bands of S-PLUS complemented with GALEX (UV), VHS-VISTA (NIR) and AllWISE (MIR) data. We estimate photometric redshifts ({\sigma}_ NMAD $\sim$ 0.0219) with a lower limit of z_ lim $\sim$ 0.03. Stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs) and D4000_N index estimates were obtained through a machine learning approach, by matching S-PLUS photometric data to SDSS spectroscopic data. The completeness of the catalog (72%) was calculated by comparing with mock catalogs ...

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing the plasma state in the near-Sun environment is essential to constrain the mechanisms that heat and accelerate the solar wind. In this study, we use Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations from Encounters 1 through 24 to investigate the radial evolution of solar wind plasma and magnetic field properties in this region. Using intervals with high field-of-view ($>85\%$) coverage, we derive the radial profiles of magnetic field strength ($|B|$), proton density ($N$), bulk speed ($V$), total proton temperature ($T$), parallel ($T_\parallel$) and perpendicular ($T_\perp$) temperatures, temperature anisotropy ($T_\perp/T_\parallel$), plasma beta ($\beta$), Alfvén Mach number ($M_A$), and magnetic field fluctuations ($\delta B/B$) for sub and super-Alfvénic regions. In super-Alfvénic regions, power-law of $|B|$, $N$, $V$, and $T$ as a function of heliocentric distance are broadly consistent with previous \textit{Helios} results at $>0.3$ AU. The radial evolution of the components of the temperature tensor reveals distinct behavior: $T_\perp$ decreases monotonically with distance, whereas $T_\parallel$ exhibits a non-monotonic trend -- decreasing in the sub-Alfvénic region, increasing just beyond the Alfvén surface. We interpret the increase in $T_\parallel$ as a proxy for proton beam occurrence. We further examine the evolution of magnetic field fluctuations, finding decreasing radial/parallel fluctuations but enhanced tangential/normal/perpendicular fluctuations in sunward direction. These fluctuations may provide free energy for beam generation and particle heating via wave-particle interactions.
#### Re-visiting the Canis Major star-forming region with Gaia data release 3 data

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The Canis Major (CMa) star-forming region, a remote molecular cloud complex within the recently discovered Radcliffe Wave, remains under-explored in the literature. Aims: We revisit the stellar census in the CMa region, characterizing its stellar population, kinematics, and age using recent astrometric and photometric data from the third data release of the Gaia space mission (Gaia DR3). Methods: We conducted a membership analysis of Gaia DR3 sources across a 16 deg$^2$ field encompassing the youngest subgroups in CMa. This new stellar census, combined with spectroscopic observations, allowed us to investigate the structure, kinematics, and age of this region. Results: We identified 1531 objects as members of the CMa region, confirming 401 previously known members and introducing 1130 new candidate members. These objects have magnitudes ranging from 10 to 18 mag in the G band from Gaia DR3. We identified two subgroups of CMa stars in our sample labelled as Cluster A and Cluster B. They are located at roughly the same distance ($d_{A} = 1150^{+79}_{-88}$ pc and $d_{B} = 1183^{+103}_{-108}$ pc) and exhibit similar space motions that can be derived thanks to the precise radial velocities obtained in this study. The subgroups have a mean isochronal age of about 2-3 Myr. However, based on infrared photometry we show that Cluster A has a higher fraction of disc-bearing stars suggesting that it could be somewhat younger than Cluster B. Conclusions: Our analysis provides new insights into the stellar population of the Canis Major region, by identifying new members, characterizing their kinematics, and assessing their evolutionary stages. Future studies incorporating additional data from upcoming Gaia data releases, multi-wavelength and high-resolution spectroscopic observations will be essential to further advance our understanding of the history of star formation in this region.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) emit broad band radio wave radiation that may, in rare cases, encode atomic hydrogen (HI) absorption signals produced as they traverse the interstellar medium of their host galaxies. Combining such signals with high resolution HI emission maps offers a unique opportunity to probe the dynamics of neutral gas at cosmological distances through constraints of the HI excitation temperature $T_{spin}$, which characterises the balance of neutral gas phases and the underlying thermal processes within these galactic environments. While no absorption signal has been recorded in an FRB to date, we demonstrate a proof of concept with the bright (F = 35 Jy ms) and narrow (0.2 ms) FRB 20211127I detected by ASKAP. We find a 3${\sigma}$ upper limit on the integrated optical depth in the pulse-averaged spectrum of 33 km s$^{-1}$, and, based on the HI emission observed in a 3 hr MeerKAT L-band observation, subsequently find a lower limit on $T_{spin}$ of 26 K. While this test case provides little constraining power, we find that narrow, non-repeating FRBs with fluences greater than 20/70/150 Jy ms observed with all dishes with the current MeerKAT/ASKAP/DSA telescopes can probe integrated optical depths below 5 km s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, we highlight that utilising FAST's incredible sensitivity to stack thousands of bursts from hyperactive repeaters also provides a plausible avenue through which HI absorption, and hence $T_{spin}$, can be measured. Finally, we discuss how HI absorption can address several modern challenges in FRB science, providing a physical anchor for locating bursts within their host galaxies and helping to disentangle the host contribution to dispersion and scattering.

 - **Abstract**
 Symbiotic stars are interacting binaries consisting of a red giant and typically a white dwarf, important as potential Type Ia supernova progenitors. Despite theoretical predictions that white dwarfs in symbiotic systems should often be magnetic, direct evidence has been elusive. We report the discovery of a $682.5 \pm 7$ s periodicity in the XMM-Newton X-ray light curve that we interpret as the spin period of the WD in CH Cygni. This detection provides strong evidence for a magnetic white dwarf in CH Cygni, making it only the second WD symbiotic star with confirmed X-ray pulsations after R Aquarii. Our discovery supports the magnetic propeller model previously proposed for CH Cygni's jet activity and state transitions.
#### First Detection of $γ$-Ray Emission from the Compact Symmetric Object JVAS J1311+1658

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of $\gamma$-ray emission from the young radio galaxy JVAS~J1311+1658, classified as a compact symmetric object (CSO). This detection is characterized by a recent GeV $\gamma$-ray flare identified in Fermi-LAT data during MJD~60032.6--60132.6, with a $\gamma$-ray source detected at a significance level of $\sim6.2\sigma$. The average 0.1--300~GeV flux is measured to be $(1.6 \pm 0.6)\times10^{-8}\,\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$, with a photon spectral index of $\Gamma = 2.15 \pm 0.185$. We find that a radiative model of the radio lobes significantly underestimates the observed $\gamma$-ray emission. The strong flux and short-term variability over $\sim$100 days suggest that the emission likely originates from newly launched sub-kiloparsec-scale jets at the core. This detection provides a unique window into the extreme environments and early-stage jet activity of young radio galaxies, offering insights into their initial evolution and the formation of relativistic jets in the earliest phases of galaxy growth.

 - **Abstract**
 Star-forming edge-on galaxies often exhibit extended halo radiation in multiple bands, providing ideal laboratories for studying the transfer of matter from the disk to the halo. We investigate the transport of cosmic-ray electrons (CREs) and the associated galactic wind, and assess their impact on the surrounding medium in NGC 3044. We obtained the NGC 3044 total intensity image at 943 MHz from the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) observations with a resolution of 16 arcsec and an rms noise of 20 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. The sensitivity is higher than the previous observations at similar frequencies. We find that the ASKAP intensity profiles perpendicular to the disk can be fit with two exponential components. The scale heights of the thin and thick disks are $0.43 \pm 0.13$ kpc and $1.91 \pm 0.26$ kpc, respectively. By jointly fitting total intensity and spectral index profiles with one-dimensional advection and diffusion models, we find that CREs are advected outward from the disk with the velocity increasing with height in a power law. Beyond $\sim3$ kpc, the velocity exceeds the escape speed of $\sim400$ km s$^{-1}$, indicating a strong wind. We further identify a possible superbubble of radius $\sim3$ kpc filled with soft X-ray emitting hot gas and surrounded by an HI shell and a bright H$\alpha$ rim. These results demonstrate that radio continuum observations provide a powerful probe of cosmic-ray-driven winds in normal star-forming spiral galaxies.
#### JWST spectra are consistent with the edge-on star-forming galaxy scenario for the "runaway supermassive black hole"

 - **Abstract**
 The linear structure reported by van Dokkum et al. (2023) has been proposed as either a massive stellar wake produced by a runaway supermassive black hole (SMBH) or a bulgeless edge-on galaxy. New JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations target the tip of the structure, where a SMBH would produce a bow shock, whereas a normal galaxy would host an HII region. Using standard BPT diagrams ([OIII]5007/Hb vs [NII]6583/Ha and [OIII]5007/Hb vs [OII]6716,6731/Ha), we find that the line ratios at the tip fall on the locus of low-metallicity low-extinction HII regions. This region does not overlap with loci typical of shocks in merging galaxies. Thus, these results are consistent with the interpretation that the linear structure is a star-forming galaxy, with the bright knot representing one of its HII regions.
#### Chemistry in the High expansion-velocity C-rich evolved star AFGL2233. Isotopic ratios, peculiarities and evolutionary status

 - **Abstract**
 High expansion velocity carbon stars (HVCs) are a rare class of evolved stars whose circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) combine C-rich chemistry with unusually high expansion velocities typical of O-rich massive evolved stars. AFGL2233 has been proposed as a high-mass evolved object that exhausted hot-bottom burning. Studying its chemistry is essential to understand the nature and evolution of these objects. We characterize the chemical composition and isotopic ratios of the CSE of AFGL2233 and investigate chemical peculiarities, including the presence of N- and O-bearing species in a C-rich environment. We carried out a complete line survey at 3 mm and 1 mm using the IRAM 30m telescope, complemented by Herschel/HIFI FIR observations and interferometric maps of SiO, C2H, and HCN. Molecular emission was analyzed using rotational diagrams and radiative transfer modeling under the LVG approximation. Column densities and fractional abundances were derived for more than 30 molecular species, including isotopologues, and compared with other evolved stars. The Gaia DR3 distance of 1.236 kpc implies a luminosity of ~2 Lsun, consistent with an initial mass of 4.5-9 Msun. The molecular inventory confirms C-rich chemistry but reveals unusually high abundances of NH3, H2O, and SiN. The isotopic ratios vary among species, with 12C/13C ranging from 7 to 55. The C2H/C4H ratio is abnormally high compared with C-rich AGB stars. The presence of SiN and high NH3 may indicate N-enrichment or the influence of a companion. AFGL2233 is likely a high-mass AGB or super-AGB star with a complex evolutionary history involving nucleosynthesis, shocks, and possible binary interaction.

 - **Abstract**
 A robust stellar initial mass function (IMF) is crucial in any studies related to star formation. However, the direct measurement of the stellar IMF is confined to the local universe, limited by the resolving power of telescopes. Recently, a new method for accessing the stellar IMF beyond the local universe has been developed. The observed detection rate of transient lensed stars -- individual, massive, thus luminous stars in strongly lensed galaxies that are temporarily detectable upon stellar microlensing -- can serve as a probe to break the IMF-star formation history degeneracy in studies utilizing spectral energy distribution fitting, hence providing a window to look at the IMF at a subsample of gravitationally lensed galaxies. In this proceeding, I summarize the contributed talk given at IAUS402 entitled the same as this contribution and highlight some key results, which currently show no evidence for a top-heavy IMF in $z \approx 1$ galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray output of low-metallicity starburst galaxies is a key component of stellar feedback, tracing the processes responsible for gas ionization and chemical enrichment. The integrated X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) from high-mass X-ray binaries in star-forming galaxies scales with both the star formation rate (SFR) and host-galaxy metallicity $Z$. Due to the inverse correlation between $L_X/\mathrm{SFR}$ and $Z$, the contribution of X-ray binaries to the ionizing photon budget is enhanced in metal-poor systems and may ionize He II in the surrounding interstellar medium, powering nebular He II $\lambda4686$ emission. The blue compact dwarf galaxy ESO 338-IG04 (ESO 338-4) provides a nearby laboratory for studying stellar feedback in a low-metallicity starburst, combining vigorous recent star formation, low metallicity ($12+\log(\mathrm{O/H})\approx7.9$), and a rich population of massive stellar clusters. We characterize the X-ray emission of ESO 338-4 and its halo using new deep Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. We analyze X-ray spectra, light curves, and images to constrain the nature of its X-ray sources. We identify five ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) and diffuse hot gas surrounding the galaxy. Two ULXs are spatially associated with stellar clusters. The total X-ray luminosity exceeds $10^{41}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. The brightest source, ULX1, shows variability on day timescales and lacks a stellar-cluster counterpart. Photoionization modeling shows that X-ray sources significantly impact the ionizing photon budget; models with ULX1 as the ionizing source predict nebular He II $\lambda4686$ luminosities of $\sim10^{39}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The improved sensitivity of Gravitational-Wave detectors and the development of eccentric waveform models enable us to explore the growing catalog of gravitational-wave events with measurable eccentricity. This opens new opportunities to gain insight into the formation channels and evolutionary pathways of compact binary systems using eccentricity. However, most recent population analyses have been limited to quasi-circular binaries, primarily due to constraints in waveform modeling and sensitivity estimates. We are now entering an era where both of these limitations are being addressed, allowing for a more comprehensive investigation of eccentric binary populations. In this work, we perform the first population inference analysis that simultaneously fits the mass, spin, redshift, and eccentricity distribution. Specifically, we use source-parameter estimation provided by the Rapid Iterative FiTting (RIFT) framework using the SEOBNRv5EHM waveform model, and a default O4a population model extended to include eccentricity. We find population properties broadly consistent with conclusions obtained in previous analyses assuming quasi-circular binaries. Consistent with our conclusions about each event, we bound the branching ratio for eccentric events to be below $0.0239$ at $90\%$ confidence with our fiducial eccentricity mixture models. Using four different parametric population models for eccentricity, we point out that the rate of eccentric events is weakly constrained by observations and highly model-dependent.

 - **Abstract**
 The environments of deflectors in strong lensing systems affect our ability to test cosmological models and constrain evolutionary properties of galaxies. Here we measure the deflector scale (Einstein mass) and deflector environment (halo mass) of 89 spectroscopically confirmed strong lenses in the ASTRO3D Galaxy Evolution With Lenses (AGEL) survey. We classify deflector scale by measuring $\theta_{\rm{E}}$ to determine the mass enclosed by the Einstein radius, $M(<\theta_{\rm{E}})$. We quantify deflector environment by using photometric redshifts to determine the galaxy surface density to the fifth-nearest neighbor $\Sigma_5(z)$. We find that 47.2% of our deflectors are embedded in cluster environments, whereas only 9.0% have cluster-scale Einstein radii (masses). We measure a weak correlation ($r = 0.38$) between Einstein mass and $\Sigma_5(z)$, suggesting that the assumption of single galaxy-scale deflectors in lens modeling is overly-simplified. We hypothesize that the weak correlation results from galaxy-scale bias in the original AGEL selection and the observational challenge of detecting faint arcs with large Einstein radii. Comparing number densities, $N_{\rm{gal}}$, between AGEL and control fields, we find that AGEL deflectors are in systematically denser environments. Our study provides a method to identify strong lenses as a function of deflector environment and approximate the impact of large-scale environment in lens modeling. We provide the measured lensing parameters for our 89 AGEL systems as well as $z_{\rm{phot}}$ and $r$-mag (AB) maps of the line-of-sight.
