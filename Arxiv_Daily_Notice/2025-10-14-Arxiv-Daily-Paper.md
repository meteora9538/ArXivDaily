 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way (MW) is thought to have experienced a $\sim$3:1 mass-ratio merger event near redshift $z\sim2$ with a significantly retrograde trajectory. This now-disrupted dwarf galaxy is commonly known as the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). In this paper, we investigate the impact of the GSE merger trajectory on metal abundances in the MW disk. We construct numerical models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) incorporating radial gas flows to account for angular momentum transport during the merger event. Unlike prograde trajectories, radial and retrograde mergers are generally accompanied by a major sinking event in which much of the interstellar medium falls toward the Galactic center. This effect leads to a net decrease in surface density across much of the disk. Ongoing Type Ia supernova explosions then drive a rapid decline in [$\alpha$/Fe] due to the lowered gas supply. Consequently, radial and retrograde trajectories increase (decrease) the number of low (high) [$\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations relative to prograde trajectories. If high [$\alpha$/Fe] stars form in sufficient numbers through other mechanisms, the effect of the retrograde trajectory can produce a bimodal [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution at fixed [Fe/H], as observed in the MW. In models dominated by low [$\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations, a bimodality does not arise because the retrograde trajectory cannot increase the number of high [$\alpha$/Fe] stars. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of gas dynamics in GCE models featuring major merger events.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation drives changes in the compositions of galaxies, fusing H and He into heavier nuclei. This paper investigates the differences in abundance evolution between metal and non-metal isotopes using recent models of Galactic chemical evolution appropriate for the thin disk epoch. A strong degeneracy arises between metal yields from stellar populations and the mean Galactocentric radial velocity of the interstellar medium (ISM). Similar metallicities arise when increases (decreases) in metal yields are combined with increases (decreases) to the gas flow velocity. A similar degeneracy exists between metal yields and the rate of gas ejection from the ISM. We demonstrate that this degeneracy can be confidently broken with precise measurements of the hydrogen (D/H) and helium ($^3$He/$^4$He) isotope ratios in the Galactic ISM. At fixed O/H, higher metal yields lead to higher D/H and lower $^3$He/$^4$He. Measurements available to date are not sufficiently precise or numerous to draw confident conclusions. A detailed inventory of non-metal isotopes in the Milky Way would provide critical empirical constraints for stellar and galactic astrophysics, as well as a new test of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We forecast that only $\sim$4 additional measurements of $^3$He/$^4$He within $\sim$$3$ kpc of the Sun are required to measure the primordial $^3$He/$^4$He ratio at $\sim$30\% precision. In parallel, empirical benchmarks on metal yields also have the power to inform stellar models, since absolute yield calculations carry factor of $\sim$$2-3$ uncertainties related to various complex processes (e.g., rotational mixing, convection, mass loss, failed supernovae).

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) catalog, including space-based photometry, photometric redshifts, and physical parameters for more than 80,000 galaxies. The imaging used for this catalog comes from the CEERS survey, which has NIRCam coverage over ~100 sq. arcmin of the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) in seven filters from 1.15$\mu$m to 4.44$\mu$m. Alongside these data, we also include ancillary HST imaging in seven filters from 0.435$\mu$m to 1.6$\mu$m. We used Source Extractor with hot and cold detection settings to extract photometry. We derive photometric redshifts using the spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling code, LePHARE, and estimate their accuracy using spectroscopically confirmed galaxies out to $z\sim10$, with $\sigma_{NMAD}$ ranging from 0.035-0.073, depending strongly on galaxy magnitude and redshift. We compute stellar masses, star formation rates, and E(B-V) using three different SED fitting codes with different templates and assumptions about the galaxy star formation histories. All of these measurements, as well as the full mosaics in all filters, and redshift probability distribution functions, are made available via the CEERS DR1.0 data release.

 - **Abstract**
 El Gordo (ACT-CL J0102$-$4915) is a massive galaxy cluster with two major mass components at redshift $z=0.87$. Using SED fitting results from JWST/NIRCam photometry, the fraction of quenched galaxies in this cluster was measured in two bins of stellar mass: $9<\log{({M_*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})}<10$ and $10\leq\log{({M_*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})}<12$. While there is no correlation between the quenched fraction and angular separation from the cluster's overall center of mass, there is a correlation between the quenched fraction and angular separation from the center of the nearest of the two mass components for the less-massive galaxies. This suggests that environmental quenching processes are in place at $z\sim1$, and that dwarf galaxies are more affected by those processes than massive galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the data release of the Ly$\alpha$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS), one of the largest optical spectroscopic surveys of faint high-redshift galaxies. The survey provides 7408 optical spectra of candidate $z \sim 2-3$ galaxies and QSOs in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey D1, D2 (COSMOS), and D4 fields. The $R \sim 1000$ spectra were obtained using the IMACS spectrograph at the Magellan Baade telescope, with typical integrations of 12 hr. From these spectra, we measured 5575 high-confidence spectroscopic redshifts, of which 4176 are at $z > 1.7$, thereby substantially increasing the number of public spectroscopic redshifts at $z \approx 2-3$ in COSMOS and the other survey fields. The data release includes Ly$\alpha$ transmission fluctuations measured in $4.7 \times 10^5$ pixels, which were used to create 3D maps of the intergalactic medium (IGM) transmission spanning 1.65 deg${}^2$ and $z = 2.2-2.8$ at a resolution of 4 $h^{-1}$ cMpc. These are the largest such maps to date and provide a novel tracer of large-scale structure in legacy fields. We also provide ancillary data including mock surveys. The LATIS data will enable a variety of community studies of galaxy evolution, environments, and the IGM around cosmic noon.

 - **Abstract**
 The Event Horizon Telescope is preparing to produce time sequences of black hole images, or movies. In anticipation, we developed an autocorrelation technique to measure apparent rotational motion using the image-domain pattern speed $\Omega_p$. Here, we extend this technique to the visibility domain and introduce the visibility amplitude pattern speed $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$. We show that in the Illinois v3 library of EHT source models, $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ depends on the source inclination, black hole mass, black hole spin, accretion state (MAD or SANE), and baseline length, and then provide approximate fits for this dependence. We show that $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ is particularly sensitive to baseline length for MAD (strongly magnetized) models, and that the slope of this dependence can be used to constrain black hole spin. As with $\Omega_p$, models predict that $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ is well below the Keplerian frequency in the emission region for all model parameters. This is consistent with the idea that $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ measures an angular phase speed for waves propagating through the emission region. Finally, we identify the information that would be provided by space-based millimeter VLBI such as the proposed BHEX mission.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a time-averaged spectral analysis of the 2024 XRISM observation of the narrow-line Seyfert-1 galaxy MCG--6-30-15, taken contemporaneously with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. Our analysis leverages a unique combination of broadband and high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy to definitively isolate and characterize both broad and narrow emission and absorption features in this source. The best-fitting model for the joint spectral analysis is very well described by reflection from the inner accretion disk illuminated by a compact corona, modified by multi-zone ionized absorption from an outflowing wind along the line of sight. The XRISM/Resolve data confirm that a strong, relativistically-broadened Fe K$\alpha$ emission line is required in order to obtain an adequate model fit. The Resolve data additionally verify the presence of a $v_{\rm out} \sim 2300$ km/s component of this outflowing wind, find tentative evidence for a $v_{\rm out} \sim 20,000$ km/s wind component, and indicate that the reflection from distant, neutral material may originate in a non-uniform structure rather than the traditional torus of AGN unification schemes. Though a rapid prograde black hole spin is statistically preferred by the best-fitting model, consistent with previous results, the AGN flux variability over the course of the observation complicates the interpretation of the time-averaged spectra. This insight, clarified by the combination of high signal-to-noise and high spectral resolution in the joint dataset, emphasizes the importance of time-resolved, high-resolution spectral analysis in unambiguously measuring the physical properties of variable AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 We employ the high-redshift suite of FIRE-2 cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations to investigate the evolution of gas-phase metallicity radial gradients in galaxies in the epoch of reionization (EoR). Our sample consists of 22 galaxies spanning the redshift range $z \sim 10-5$. We find that galaxies at $z\sim10$ exhibit a median metallicity gradient of $-0.15\,\mathrm{dex\cdot kpc^{-1}}$ with substantial scatter, which gradually flatten to $-0.1\,\mathrm{dex\cdot kpc^{-1}}$ at $z\sim6$, accompanied by a reduction in scatter. In the EoR, metallicity gradients correlate positively with stellar mass: more massive galaxies display flatter gradients with smaller scatter, broadly consistent with recent JWST observations. At fixed stellar mass, galaxies with higher star formation rates (SFRs) exhibit steeper negative gradients, while sSFR shows a strong anti-correlation with gradient slope. Because EoR galaxies in FIRE-2 generally lack significant rotational support, we adopt the ratio of peak-to-peak velocity shear to twice the velocity dispersion ($\Delta v/2\sigma$) as a proxy for the strength of gas flows. We find a strong positive correlation between metallicity gradients and $\Delta v/2\sigma$: galaxies with lower $\Delta v/2\sigma$ (i.e., weaker gas flows) tend to exhibit steeper negative gradients. Furthermore, galaxies with steeper gradients display higher central SFR surface densities, suggesting localized star formation with inefficient interstellar medium mixing that drives inside-out chemical enrichment in galaxy evolution in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 During cosmic noon ($z\sim1-3$), when both star formation and black hole growth peaked, galaxy mergers are predicted to trigger dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) that eventually coalesce as supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. However, observations of dual quasars with sub-5 kpc separations-the critical phase preceding final coalescence-have remained elusive due to angular resolution limitations. We present the discovery and confirmation of two sub-arcsecond dual quasars at $z>1$, selected from 59,025 SDSS quasars, which fall within the footprint of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey. Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and slitless spectroscopy, we confirmed SDSS J1625+4309 ($z=1.647$, separation 0.55"/4.7 kpc) and SDSS J0229$-$0514 ($z=3.174$, separation 0.42"/3.2 kpc), probing the sub-5 kpc separation regime. Through novel combination of WFC3/IR direct imaging (F140W) and grism spectroscopy (G141), we resolve both components morphologically and spectroscopically confirm their dual nature via detection of H$\beta$+[OIII] and MgII emission lines in each nucleus. Two-dimensional image decomposition reveals distinct host galaxy morphologies: J1625+4309 shows an extended, disturbed structure ($R_e$=4.7 kpc) indicative of an ongoing major merger, while J0229$-$0514 exhibits a compact host ($R_e$=1.4 kpc) suggesting an advanced coalescence stage. Black hole mass estimates based on virial relations yield M$_{\mathrm{BH}} \sim 10^{8.1}-10^{8.7} M_\odot$ with line-of-sight velocity offsets of $(0.7\pm0.1)\times10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$ and $(1.0\pm0.2)\times10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. These confirmations directly constrain the frequency and properties of close dual quasars, opening new avenues for studying SMBH mergers at cosmic noon.

 - **Abstract**
 Complex organic molecules (COMs) are observed to be abundant in various astrophysical environments, in particular toward star forming regions they are observed both toward protostellar envelopes as well as shocked regions. Emission spectrum especially of heavier COMs may consists of up to hundreds of lines, where line blending hinders the analysis. However, identifying the molecular composition of the gas leading to the observed millimeter spectra is the first step toward a quantitative analysis. We develop a new method based on supervised machine learning to recognize spectroscopic features of the rotational spectrum of molecules in the 3mm atmospheric transmission band for a list of species including COMs with the aim to obtain a detection probability. We used local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) modeling to build a large set of synthetic spectra of 20 molecular species including COMs with a range of physical conditions typical for star forming regions. We successfully designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that provides detection probabilities of individual species in the spectra. We demonstrate that the produced CNN-model has a robust performance to detect spectroscopic signatures from these species in synthetic spectra. We evaluate its ability to detect molecules according to the noise level, frequency coverage, and line-richness, and also test its performance for incomplete frequency coverage with high detection probabilities for the tested parameter space, and no false predictions. Ultimately, we apply the CNN-model to obtain predictions on observational data from the literature toward line-rich hot-core like sources, where detection probabilities remain reasonable with no false detection. We prove the use of CNNs facilitating the analysis of complex millimeter spectra both on synthetic spectra as well as first tests on observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Determining the orbital periods of cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) is essential for confirming candidates and for the understanding of their evolutionary state. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides month-long photometric data across nearly the entire sky that can be used to search for periodic variability in such systems. Aims. This study aims to identify and confirm the orbital periods for members of a recent compilation of magnetic CVs (known as polars) using TESS light curves. In addition, we set out to investigate their reliability, and hence the relevance of TESS for variability studies of CVs. Results. Ninety-five of the 217 polars in our sample have pipeline-produced TESS two-minute cadence light curves available. The results from our period search are overall in good agreement with the previously reported values. Out of the 95 analysed systems, 85 exhibit periods consistent with the literature values. Among the remaining ten objects, four are asynchronous polars, where TESS light curves resolve the orbital period, the white dwarf's spin period, and additional beat frequencies. For four systems, the periods detected from the TESS data differ from those previously reported. For two systems, a period detection was not possible. Our analysis of the flattened TESS light curves reveals a positive correlation between noise levels and TESS magnitude. Our noise level estimates resemble the rmsCDPP, a measure of white noise provided with the TESS pipeline products. However, our values for the noise level are systematically higher than the rmsCDPP indicating red noise and high-frequency signals hidden in the flattened light curves. Additionally, we present a statistical methodology to assess the reliability of period detections in TESS light curves. We find that for TESS magnitudes $\gtrsim$ 17, period detections become increasingly unreliable.
#### What is the contribution of gravitational infall on the mass assembly of star-forming clouds? A case study in a numerical simulation of the interstellar medium

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation in galaxies is a complex phenomenon occurring on a very wide range of scales, and molecular clouds are at the heart of this process. The formation of these structures and the subsequent collapse of the gas within them to form new stars remain unresolved scientific questions. In particular, the role and importance of gravity at between the disk scale height and prestellar cores (100 to 0.01 pc) are still topics of debate. In this work, we conduct a case study examining the mass assembly and evolution of a giant molecular cloud complex in a numerical stratified-box simulation of the interstellar medium with photo-ionizing and supernova driving and resolving down to scales $\gtrsim 1$ pc and densities up to $10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. By introducing tracer particles to precisely track the forces acting on the gas during its evolution towards and within the clouds, we are able to quantify how much of the mass inflow is driven by the self-gravity of the gas and the gravity from the stellar disk. We find that up to 20% of the gas is gravity-driven at a scale of 100 pc, contributing 10% of the inflow from the warm to the cold phase and 20% from the cold phase to the individual molecular clouds, reaching up to 45% inside the molecular gas, at densities $\gtrsim 400$ cm$^{-3}$. However, at the 100 pc scale, the contribution of gravity-driven gas on the linewidth is negligible. We conclude that the bulk of the gas motions assembling the clouds in our simulation are caused by the supernova-driven supersonic turbulence, which results in locally convergent flows, with a small contribution from the stellar gravitational potential.

 - **Abstract**
 How galaxies drive reionization and what governs its geometry remain fundamental questions. We present JWST/NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) observations toward two of the most Ly$\alpha$-transmissive QSO sightlines near the end of reionization. We find that regions at $z \sim 5.7$ along both sightlines previously found to be low-density in Ly$\alpha$ emitters are also underdense in [O III] emitters, with densities less than half the cosmic mean. Other transmissive regions, however, are found to coincide with average-density environments, indicating that multiple pathways may produce high IGM transmission. For the first time, we measure the two-dimensional cross-correlation between IGM transmission and galaxy positions, revealing evidence for anisotropic ionization geometry. Specifically, we detect enhanced transmission at transverse distances of $\Delta r \sim 0.8$ times the mean free path, consistent with ionizing photons escaping preferentially along large-scale structures that are aligned with, but offset from, the line of sight. This anisotropic escape may contribute to the observed patchiness of reionization and challenges the assumption of isotropic ionized bubble growth in current models.
#### SN 2021lwz: Another Exotic Luminous and Fast Evolving Optical Type Ic Broad-Lined Supernova ?

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Current large-scale, high-cadence surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), provide detections of new and rare types of transients and supernovae whose physical origins are not well understood. Aims. We investigate the nature of SN 2021lwz at a redshift z=0.065, an overluminous supernova (SN) of absolute magnitude, $M_{g} \sim -20.1$ AB, falling in the lower range of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) luminosities, and discovered in a faint dwarf galaxy with an absolute magnitude of $M_{g} \simeq -14.5$ AB. Methods. SN 2021lwz is studied using optical spectroscopy, photometry and imaging linear polarimetry obtained during several follow-up campaigns. All the data are used to analyse and model the evolution of the explosion. Comparisons with other SNe of well known or rarer types are investigated. Results. SN 2021lwz belongs to the rare class of rapidly evolving transients. The bolometric light curve rises in about 7 days to a peak luminosity of about 5 x10^{43} erg/s, at a rate of 0.2 mag/day close to the peak. Spectroscopy modeling reveals more similarities with a normal Type Ic-like SN than with a SLSN before peak, showing broadened lines after peak. Light curve modeling shows that the Arnett model of the bolometric light curve using a radioactive source ($^{56}$ Ni) is not able to reasonably explain the light curve evolution. A magnetar model seems more appropriate, suggesting that the explosion of low ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej} \sim 0.24 ~M_\odot$) took place in a low mass ($M \sim 10^{6.66}~M_\odot$) dwarf galaxy of specific star-formation rate about ten times larger than typical star-forming galaxies. Conclusions. Given its spectroscopic properties and the low ejecta mass needed to model its light-curve, SN 2021lwz does not match with many core-collapse H-poor SNe Types. It shares similarities with rarer transients like SN 2014ft, iPTF 16asu and SN 2018gep.
