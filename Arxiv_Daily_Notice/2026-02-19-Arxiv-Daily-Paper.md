 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive photometric and kinematic study of the open clusters HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878, located in the innermost regions of the Galactic disc. Utilizing data from Gaia DR3 and the UPMASK membership algorithm, we identify 44, 55, and 112 most probable members for HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878, respectively. The mean proper-motion components are obtained as (-5.901 +/- 0.41, -6.213 +/- 0.40), (-3.231 +/- 0.56, -4.564 +/- 0.47), and (-3.830 +/- 0.51, -5.198 +/- 0.44) mas yr^-1 for HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878, respectively. The open clusters span a broad range of evolutionary stages, with estimated ages of log(t/yr) = 8.38 +/- 0.08, 7.04 +/- 0.09, and 9.04 +/- 0.09, and corresponding heliocentric distances of 7.36 +/- 0.37, 6.79 +/- 0.18, and 6.17 +/- 0.22 kpc. The obtained metallicities are 0.0388 +/- 0.0039, 0.0259 +/- 0.0028, and 0.0209 +/- 0.0023, respectively. Total mass estimates are 135, 755, and 204 solar masses, respectively, highlighting notable differences in stellar content across the clusters. An analysis of dynamical relaxation times suggests that HSC 25 and HSC 2878 are dynamically evolved, whereas the much younger HSC 37 is still in an early phase of dynamical evolution. The high space velocities and orbital parameters of these clusters reveal significant deviations from typical disc kinematics. HSC 25 and HSC 37 exhibit eccentric orbits and small perigalactic distances, consistent with dynamically heated or accreted origins within the Galactic bulge. In contrast, HSC 2878's relaxed, planar orbit suggests in situ bulge membership despite its age. These findings point toward a heterogeneous dynamical origin for the clusters, with implications for star formation and evolution in the inner Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Jellyfish galaxies, which exhibit tails of gas opposite to their direction of motion, are a galaxy population showcasing the most extreme effects of ram pressure stripping (RPS). We present the emission line properties of a preliminary sample of five jellyfish galaxies in the Coma cluster, observed with the WEAVE Large-IFU as part of the Coma Legacy IFU Survey (CLIFS). When complete, CLIFS will form a sample of 29 jellyfish galaxies in Coma, selected based on the presence of one-sided tails in the radio continuum, enabling a comprehensive picture of the effects of ram pressure on galaxies in the Coma cluster. We extract emission line properties and confirm consistency between disk fluxes measured from WEAVE and MaNGA for galaxies with overlapping disk coverage between surveys. Comparing resolved radio and H$\alpha$-based star formation rates, we find that, in contrast to the disk, the dominant source of tail emission is not star formation. We find evidence for diffuse ionized gas excited by RPS-driven shocks in the tails, as indicated by: (1) LINER-like tail emission with the [OI]/H$\alpha$ BPT diagnostic; (2) enhanced [OII]/H$\alpha$ ratios in the tails relative to the disks; and (3) similarly elevated emission line velocities and velocity dispersions in the tails with respect to the disks. These results demonstrate that ram-pressure-driven shocks dominate the ionized emission in jellyfish galaxy tails.

 - **Abstract**
 Mid-infrared observations of planet-forming disks reveal a wide diversity in molecular spectra. Carbon and oxygen abundances play a central role in setting the chemical environment of the inner disk and the spectral appearance. We aim to systematically explore how variations in elemental carbon and oxygen abundances affect the mid-infrared spectra of planet-forming disks, and to identify robust mid-infrared molecular diagnostics of C/H, O/H, and the C/O ratio. Using the thermochemical disk code ProDiMo and the line radiative transfer code FLiTs, we construct a grid of 25 models with varying carbon and oxygen abundances, covering a broad range of C/O ratios. We analyze the resulting mid-infrared molecular emission, including species such as $\rm H_2O$, $\rm CO$, $\rm CO_2$, $\rm C_2H_2$, $\rm OH$. We find that the mid-infrared molecular spectra are highly sensitive not only to the C/O ratio, but also to the absolute abundances of carbon and oxygen. Despite the same disk structure and C/O ratios, molecular fluxes (e.g., $\rm C_2H_2$, $\rm CO_2$) vary by more than an order of magnitude. This variation stems from the differences in excitation conditions and emitting regions caused by the elemental abundances of oxygen and carbon. We identify diagnostic molecular flux ratios - such as $\rm CO_2$/$\rm H_2O$ and $\rm H_2O$/$\rm C_2H_2$ - that can serve as tracers of C/H and O/H respectively. By combining these diagnostics, we demonstrate a method to infer the underlying C/O ratio. Our model grid provides a framework for interpreting mid-infrared molecular emission from disks, allowing estimates of elemental abundances if the disk properties and structure are known. Comparisons with recent JWST observations suggest that a variety in C and O abundances is seen in a sample of T Tauri disks, possibly shaped by disk transport processes and the presence of gaps.

 - **Abstract**
 Bilobate contact binaries comprise a significant fraction of the relict Kuiper Belt, which includes the exemplary contact binary (486958) Arrokoth. The surfaces of its lobes contain similar amounts of highly volatile chemical species and few craters, indicating formation in a homogeneous and gentle environment. Arrokoth's bilobate shape was initially hypothesized to have formed via the direct gravitational collapse of a pebble cloud in the solar system's protoplanetary disk. However, alternative hypotheses have proposed that Arrokoth may be the result of binary planetesimal formation and the subsequent dynamical evolution of the binary components into contact through external perturbations over long timescales. Here, we show that contact binary planetesimals like Arrokoth can form directly from the gravitational collapse of pebble clouds. We used a soft-sphere discrete element method (SSDEM) to discover that planetesimals form a wide variety of shapes, including bilobate contact binaries. This method creates planetesimals as particle-aggregates with particles resting upon each other's surfaces via mutual surface penetration. The formation of contact binaries in our simulations strengthens the hypothesis that Arrokoth, and perhaps many other contact binaries in the Kuiper Belt, formed directly as bilobate objects from gravitational collapse, and so their shapes and surfaces record the era of planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We report multiwavelength observations of the highly offset (~22.4 kpc) SN 2024abvb, the sixth Type Icn supernova to date. With a peak magnitude of Mr = -19.55 +/- 0.11 mag, it is among the most luminous in the existing sample and shows similar colours and decline rates to other SNe Icn. The early optical spectra show a blue continuum with narrow C II features (vFWHM ~ 2000 km s^-1), consistent with a typical wind velocity of a Wolf-Rayet star. The absence of C III lambda 5696 emission at the time of explosion is consistent with a Type Ibn supernova; however, the lack of narrow He lines in both the optical and near-infrared spectra supports a SNe Icn classification. Unlike the majority of SNe Icn, we do not detect broad features in the late-time (7-21 days relative to o-band peak) spectral phase of SN 2024abvb. Semi-analytical modelling of the light curves shows that it can be reproduced by ~2.6 Msun of SN ejecta interacting with ~0.3 Msun of circumstellar material (CSM), both larger than other SNe Icn but consistent with rapidly evolving SNe Ibn. The metallicity at the SN location is significantly lower than the global metallicity of its host galaxy, suggesting that line-driven mass loss required to strip the progenitor of its H and He envelopes was likely inefficient. We estimate the star-formation-rate history at the location of SN 2024abvb and find that it lies at the bottom ~5th percentile among SESNe hosts, inconsistent with a Wolf-Rayet progenitor. Based on its spectral features, local and host environment properties, and host-galaxy offset, we favour an 8-10 Msun star stripped by a compact companion as the progenitor, with a sufficient runaway velocity to reach the observed offset.
#### A XRISM View of the Iron Line Complex in NGC 1068: Rethinking the Prototypical Compton-Thick AGN

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze an XRISM/Resolve observation of NGC1068, focusing on the Fe K$\alpha$ and Fe K$\beta$ fluorescent lines and on the Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission complexes. Line centroid energies, intrinsic widths, flux ratios, and constraints on the Compton shoulder are derived through local spectral fitting, and compared with atomic calculations and theoretical predictions. The centroid energies of the Fe K$\alpha$ and Fe K$\beta$ lines tightly constrain the emitting material to be neutral or near-neutral. The observed Fe K$\beta$/K$\alpha$ ratio, together with the stringent upper limit on the Compton shoulder ($\lesssim$8--11% of the core flux), disfavour reflection dominated by a homogeneous, classical Compton-thick medium, indicating that most of the neutral Fe K$\alpha$ emission arises in optically thin or moderately Compton-thick gas. The Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission lines exhibit remarkably large velocity widths, of several thousand km~s$^{-1}$. These broad profiles closely resemble the integrated optical and infrared [O III] and [O IV] lines associated with the large-scale biconical outflow, and are naturally interpreted as the X-ray signature of a more highly ionized, faster, and more spatially confined phase of the same outflow. The iron-K emission of NGC1068 reveals a stratified circumnuclear environment in which neutral and highly ionized components arise in physically distinct regions. The neutral Fe K fluorescence originates predominantly in optically thin or mildly Compton-thick material, despite the persistently Compton-thick line-of-sight obscuration, indicating a geometrically complex cold reprocessor. The highly ionized iron emission lines trace a fast component consistent with a warm bipolar outflow on parsec scales, whose large velocities and inferred energetics suggest that it may represent an efficient channel for feedback in a heavily obscured Seyfert galaxy.
#### PDRs4All XXI. JWST-NIRCam Photometric properties of protoplanetary disks in the Orion Nebula Cluster

 - **Abstract**
 The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) provides the closest example of star and planet formation in highly irradiated environments. It is a key region to study how UV radiation from massive stars drive mass-loss in protoplanetary disks through photoevaporation. Far-UV photons (6<E<13.6 eV) heat up the gas of the disk, forming a photodissociation region (PDRs). We use the NIRCam images from the PDRs4All program combined with those of the GTO program 1256 to extract key information on ONC disks. Specifically, the radii of the disks observed in silhouette against the bright background , the presence and positions of the dissociation fronts (DFs), the presence and positions of ionization fronts (IFs), intensities of Pa $\alpha$ lines, and their near IR SEDs. From those, we construct a typology for ONC disks: Type I show an IF and DF nearly merged at the disk surface; Type II have their DFs at the disk surface and IFs at a distance of several 10s of astronomical units from the disk; and Type III also have their DF at the disk surface, but show no IF. For all disks, we find that PAH emission traces the PDR. We establish that the SEDs of candidate JuMBOs observed as part of the PDRs4All program are similar to the SEDs of Type III ONC disks except for JuMBO24, which is of Type I or II. A detailed look at this SED shows it is compatible with a young low mass binary star with an unresolved ionized disk : a microproplyd binary. We observe that the disk radius of ONC disks increases with increasing projected distance to the ionizing source interpreted as evidence of the truncation of the disks by the photoevaporation. The disk radii measured at IR wavelengths appear larger than at millimeter wavelengths, interpreted as evidence of the dust radial segregation within the disks. The thermal pressure within the PDRs of ONC disk increases with the FUV radiation field, but with a flatter slope.
#### SPT-CL J0417-4748: A Deep Chandra Study of a Relaxed Galaxy Cluster Without Central Star Formation

 - **Abstract**
 We present an in-depth Chandra X-ray analysis of the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0417$-$4748 (hereafter SPT J0417), at z = 0.58, with a focus on its thermodynamic properties and the apparent absence of central star formation. Utilizing a total Chandra exposure of 103 ks, we find that the large-scale X-ray morphology is consistent with a dynamically relaxed, cool-core system. The intracluster medium (ICM) shows a central density of 0.08+/-0.01 cm^{-3}, a central pseudo-entropy of 26^{+6}_{-5} keVcm^{2} and a central cooling time of 515^{+96}_{-75} Myr, values typical of massive cool-core clusters. Despite these conditions, no evidence of recent or ongoing star formation is detected in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of DES photometry indicates that the bulk of the stellar population formed at z~1.25, with no significant star formation over the past ~3 Gyr, while optical spectra from Magellan show no [O II] emission. Complementary ASKAP radio and Spitzer infrared data indicate a lack of strong current AGN activity in the BCG. SPT J0417 exemplifies massive, relaxed, cool-core clusters in which cooling and star formation appear almost completely quenched, providing valuable insights into how AGN feedback regulates the long-term thermal balance of the intracluster medium.
#### How Bursty is Star Formation at z>5?

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16706

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by observational evidence from JWST and theoretical results from cosmological simulations, we use a simple parametric, phenomenological model to test to what extent bursty star formation with standard Initial Mass Function, no continuous star formation, no mergers, \mr{and no dust} can account for the observed properties in the $M_{UV}$ vs $M_*$ plane of galaxies at redshifts $z>5$. We find that the simplest model that fits the data has a quiescence period between bursts $\Delta t \sim 100$~Myrs and the stellar mass in each galaxy grows linearly as a function of time from $z=12$ to $z=5$ (i.e., repeated bursts in each galaxy produce approximately equal mass in stars). The distribution of burst masses across different galaxies follows a power-law $dN/dM_* \propto M_*^\alpha$ with slope $\alpha \sim -2$. At $z>9-10$ the observed galaxy population typically had only one or two bursts of stars formation, hence the observed stellar masses at these redshifts (reaching $M_* \sim 10^{10}$~M$_\odot$), roughly represent the distribution of masses formed in one burst.
