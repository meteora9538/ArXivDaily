 - **Abstract**
 The volumetric rates and luminosity functions (LFs) of core-collapse supernovae (ccSN) and their subtypes are important for understanding the cosmic history of star formation and the buildup of ccSN products. To estimate these rates, we use data of nearby ccSNe discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) from 2014--2017, when all observations were made in the $V$-band. The sample is composed of 174 discovered or recovered events, with high spectroscopic completeness from followup observations. This allows us to obtain a statistically precise and systematically robust estimate of nearby rates for ccSNe and their subtypes. The volumetric rates are estimated by correcting the observed number of events for the survey completeness, which was estimated through injection recovery simulations using ccSN light curves. We find a total volumetric rate for ccSNe of $7.0^{+1.0}_{-0.9} \times 10^{-5} \ \textrm{yr}^{-1} \ \textrm{Mpc}^{-3} \ h^{3}_{70}$, at a median redshift of 0.0149, for absolute magnitudes at peak $M_{V,peak} \leq -14$ mag. This result is in agreement with previous local volumetric rates. We obtain volumetric rates for the different ccSN subtypes (II, IIn, IIb, Ib, Ic, Ibn, and Ic-BL), and find that the relative fractions of Type II, stripped-envelope, and interacting ccSNe are $63.2\%$, $32.3\%$, and $4.4\%$, respectively. We also estimate a volumetric rate for superluminous SNe of $1.5^{+4.4}_{-1.1} \ \textrm{yr}^{-1} \ \textrm{Gpc}^{-3} \ h^{3}_{70}$, corresponding to a fraction of $0.002\%$ of the total ccSN rate. We produce intrinsic $V$-band LFs of ccSNe and their subtypes, and show that ccSN rates steadily decline for increasing luminosities. We further investigate the specific ccSN rate as a function of their host galaxy stellar mass, and find that the rate decreases with increasing stellar mass, with significantly higher rates at lower mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Using cosmological radiation-hydrodynamical simulations, we study the effect of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on nearby dark-matter (DM) haloes in the very early universe. We find that an SMBH with a spectral energy distribution (SED) extending from the near-ultraviolet to hard X-rays, can produce a radiation background sufficient to delay gravitational collapse in surrounding DM haloes until up to $10^7$ M$_\odot$ of zero-metallicity gas is available for the formation of Population III (Pop III) stars or direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs). We model three scenarios, corresponding to an SMBH located at physical distances of 10, 100, and 1000 kpc from the Pop III host DM halo. Using these three scenarios, we use the SED to compute self-consistent photoionization, photoheating, and photodissociation rates. We include the effects of Compton scattering and gas self-shielding. The X-ray portion of the spectrum maintains an elevated free-electron fraction as the gas collapses to high density. This stimulates H2 formation, allowing the gas to cool further while counteracting the dissociation of H2 by Lyman-Werner radiation. As a result, a large cluster of Pop III stars is expected to form, except in the case with the most intense radiation in which a DCBH may instead form. Our simulated Pop III clusters have comparable HeII 1640 luminosities to the recently discovered Pop III host candidate near GN-z11, observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. In two of the scenarios we consider, the resulting clusters could be detectable using the telescope's NIRSpec instrument out to z ~ 15.

 - **Abstract**
 In today's Universe, most galaxies are rotationally supported against gravity. However, a small fraction of the most massive galaxies which are no longer forming stars (i.e., they are quiescent) are dispersion supported, and are termed 'slow-rotators.' These galaxies, which are highly evolved and often exist in dense cluster environments, are theorized to be formed by a history of merger activity that on average decreases the angular momentum of the merged system and disturbs any disk structure. At high redshift, such extreme slow-rotating systems are predicted to be far less common. While observations of massive high-redshift galaxies which enable kinematic studies are challenging to obtain, all previous data have revealed systems that are rotating rapidly. No slow-rotators have been confirmed from stellar kinematics beyond z~2. In this work we present results from James Webb Space Telescope near-infrared integral field spectroscopy of XMM-VID1-2075, a massive, quiescent galaxy at z=3.449 with a morphology exhibiting clear low-surface brightness asymmetries and with a measured spin parameter of $\lambda _{R_e} = 0.101 \pm 0.018$, consistent with the lack of rotation seen in slow rotators in the local Universe. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that merger activity played a key role in the formation and kinematic transformation of some of the most massive galaxies when the Universe was <2 Gyr old, much earlier than previously observed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present detailed chemical abundances of the brightest star in each of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies Eridanus IV and Centaurus I using high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy. The brightest star in Centaurus I, CenI-5136, is a very metal-poor star with metallicity [Fe/H] = $-2.52\pm0.17$ and chemical abundances typical of a star in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. We confirm that the star in Eridanus IV, EriIV-9808, is extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H] = $-3.25\pm0.19$) and find that it is carbon-enhanced, with [C/Fe] = $1.07\pm0.34$, as is common for many stars at this metallicity. Both stars are also neutron-capture deficient, which is typical of stars in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, but less common in other environments. We consider possible enrichment scenarios for EriIV-9808 and tentatively conclude that it is unlikely to be the descendant of a single Pop III progenitor, despite its carbon-enhancement and low metallicity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging of the nearby Seyfert 1.9 galaxy NGC 4258, which hosts strong star formation regions as well as an anomalous jet-like radio structure that extends through a significant portion of its disk. This galaxy provides a unique environment to study Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)-driven shocks and their impact on the interstellar medium (ISM) as its proximity allows for narrow-band observations of various near-infrared tracers sensitive to multiple levels of shock and radiative excitation: [Fe II] (1.64 $\mu$m), Pa$\alpha$ (1.87 $\mu$m), H$_2$ (2.21 $\mu$m), 3.3 $\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, Br$\alpha$ (4.05 $\mu$m), and Pf$\beta$ (4.66 $\mu$m), allowing us to trace shocks with parsec-scale resolution. Comparing these near-infrared observations with available ultraviolet, optical, radio, and X-ray imaging, we find that shocks present in the brightest regions of the anomalous radio structure are likely of low-velocity (50-100 km s$^{-1}$), suggesting that these features originate from AGN-driven winds that interact with the host medium and mechanically impart energy into the disk. Further, while co-spatial [Fe II] and H$_2$ emission indicate multi-phase shocks, PAH emission is relatively weaker or absent in the most shock-excited regions, consistent with the destruction of small dust grains. Finally, we propose that surveys identifying enhanced [Fe II] in AGN host galaxies may systematically reveal a key population where AGN feedback is significantly coupled with the surrounding ISM and actively shaping galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new observational evidence supporting the hypothesis that SQ-A, a starburst in the intra-group medium (IGrM) of Stephan's Quintet (SQ), is triggered by a high-speed collision between two gas systems, one associated with the IGrM (v~6900 km/s) and another with the intruder galaxy NGC7318b (v~6000 km/s). The new ALMA CO(2-1) dataset has angular resolutions between 0.2" and 7.0" and the new VLA HI datacube an angular resolution of 6.6" * 7.9". The CO maps show that the two gas systems are bridged by another system with an intermediate velocity of ~6600 km/s, whereas the HI data show that the component of v~6600 km/s fits well into a gap in the more extended v~6000 km/s component, albeit with a displacement of ~5 kpc. Both the bridge and the complementary distributions between different gas systems are common features of starbursts triggered by cloud-cloud collision. An analysis of clumps (sizes of 100--200 pc) reveals very diversified star formation (SF) activity in clumps belonging to different kinematic systems, with the molecular gas depletion time of the v~6900 km/s clumps more than 10 times longer than that of the v~6600 km/s clumps. The results are consistent with a scenario in which the enhanced SF activity (and the starburst) in the system of v~6600 km/s is due to gas compression generated in cloud-cloud collisions, whereas the suppression of SF in the v~6900 km/s system is due to vortices (i.e. gas rotation) generated in more complex collisions involving dense clouds and diffuse intercloud gas accompanied by blast-wave shocks.
#### Discovery of H$α$ Emission from a Protoplanet Candidate Around the Young Star 2MASS J16120668-3010270 with MagAO-X

 - **Abstract**
 2MASS J16120668-3010270 (hereafter 2MJ1612) is a young M0 star that hosts a protoplanetary disk in the Upper Scorpious star-forming region. Recent ALMA observations of 2MJ1612 show a mildly inclined disk ($i$=37$^\circ$) with a large dust-depleted gap (R$_\text{cav}\approx$0.4" or 53 au). We present high-contrast H$\alpha$ observations from MagAO-X on the 6.5m Magellan Telescope and new high resolution sub-mm dust continuum observations with ALMA of 2MJ1612. On both 2025 April 13 and 16, we recovered a point source with H$\alpha$ excess with SNR $\gtrsim$5 within the disk gap in our MagAO-X Angular and Spectral Differential (ASDI) images at a separation of 141.96$\pm$2.10 mas (23.45$\pm$0.29 au deprojected) from the star and position angle (PA)= 159.00$\pm$0.55$^\circ$. Furthermore, this H$\alpha$ source is within close proximity to a K band point source in SPHERE/IRDIS observation taken on 2023 July 21 \citep{sphere2025sub}. The astrometric offset between the K band and H$\alpha$ source can be explained by orbital motion of a bound companion. Thus our observations can be best explained by the discovery of an accreting protoplanet, 2MJ1612 b, with an estimated mass of 4$M_\text{Jup}$ and H$\alpha$ line flux ranging from (29.7 $\pm$7.5)$\times$10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ to (8.2$\pm$3.4)$\times$10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$. 2MJ1612 b is likely the third example of an accreting H$\alpha$ protoplanet responsible for carving the gap in its host disk, joining PDS 70b and c. Further study is necessary to confirm and characterize this protoplanet candidate and to identify any additional protoplanets that may also play a role in shaping the gap.
#### JWST/MIRI Observations of PAH Emission and Evolution in H II Regions of NGC 5457

 Aims: To investigate the physical processing of PAHs in high-mass star-forming environments. This study aims to characterize how the PAH ionization fraction varies across different H II regions and to search for spectroscopic evidence of the processing or destruction of PAH molecules in intense radiation fields. Methodology: We utilized mid-infrared integral field spectroscopic data from the JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) in its Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MRS) mode. One-dimensional spectra were extracted for each of the four H II regions. We measured the integrated fluxes of the prominent PAH emission features at 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 micron and calculated key diagnostic flux ratios to probe the physical state of the PAH population. Results: The four H II regions in NGC 5457 exhibit significant diversity in their PAH spectral characteristics. The diagnostic F(8.6)/F(11.3) ratio, a tracer of PAH ionization, varies from 0.23 to 0.62 across the sample. The region with the highest ionization (highest F(8.6)/F(11.3)) shows the lowest F(7.7)/F(8.6) ratio (1.13), while the region with the lowest ionization has the highest F(7.7)/F(8.6) ratio (2.38). Conclusion: The observed spectral diversity is primarily driven by variations in the PAH ionization state, which is governed by the local radiation field intensity. The strong anti-correlation between the F(7.7)/F(8.6) and F(8.6)/F(11.3) ratios provides a new, powerful diagnostic for PAH processing. This trend is interpreted as an evolutionary sequence where increasingly harsh radiation fields not only ionize the PAH population but also alter the surviving cations, consistent with the selective destruction of the carriers of the 7.7 micron feature.
#### SN 2021aaev: a Hydrogen-Rich Superluminous Supernova with Early Flash and Long-Lived Circumstellar Interaction in an Unusual Host Environment

 - **Abstract**
 We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN\,2021aaev, a hydrogen-rich, superluminous supernova with persistent (at least $\sim100$ days) narrow Balmer lines (SLSN-IIn) at redshift $z=0.1557$. We observed SN\,2021aaev to rise in $32.5 \pm 1.0$ days since first light and reach a peak absolute magnitude of $-21.46 \pm 0.01$ in the ATLAS $o$ band. The pre-peak spectra resemble those of typical SNe IIn with flash-ionization features arising from the interaction with a dense, confined circumstellar medium (CSM), albeit the flash timescale is longer than usual ($>20$ days). Post peak, the narrow emission lines evolve slowly, and the absence of ejecta features indicates strong deceleration by the CSM. The total radiated energy (about $1.41\times10^{51}$~ergs) is possible with a low-mass (1--$2\,M_{\odot}$) ejecta ploughing into a massive (9--$19\,M_{\odot}$), extended (outer radius $>1\times10^{16}$~cm) H-rich CSM, or alternatively, with magnetar-powered models. Interestingly, the host environment consists of a spiral galaxy with a red substructure in the south-eastern part, and the SN's exact location coincided with the quiescent red substructure (star-formation rate$=0.02^{+0.13}_{-0.02}\,M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$). Given the atypical environment and the obscuring effect of the massive CSM, a thermonuclear (Type Ia-CSM) origin cannot be ruled out. Altogether, SN\,2021aaev is a compelling case to study the diversity of SLSN-IIn features and their host environment.

 - **Abstract**
 It is likely that the disk of a tidal disruption event (TDE) is misaligned with respect to the equatorial plane of the spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH), since the initial stellar orbit before disruption is most likely has an inclined orbital plane. Such misaligned disk undergoes Lense-Thirring precession around the SMBH spin axis, leading to a precessing jet if launched in the vicinity of the SMBH and aligned with the disk angular momentum. The bound debris can also build a thick envelope which powers optical emission. In this work, we study the propagation of the precessing jet in the TDE envelope. We adopt a ``zero-Bernoulli accretion'' (ZEBRA) envelope model. A episodic jet will be observed if the line of sight is just at the envelope pole direction and $\theta_{\rm LT}=\theta_{\rm env}$, since the jet can freely escape from this low density rotation funnel, where $\theta_{\rm LT}$ and $\theta_{\rm env}$ are the jet precessing angle and the angle between the envelope polar axis and the SMBH spin axis, respectively. The jet will be choked at other directions. For $\theta_{\rm LT} < \theta_{\rm env}$, the jets can also break out of the envelope for very small precession angle $\theta_{\rm LT}$ or if the jet is aligned with SMBH spin. If the jet is choked within the envelope, the radiation produced during cocoon shock breakout will imprint characteris
