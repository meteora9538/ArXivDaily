 - **Abstract**
 We present GAMERA-OP (Orthogonal-Plus), a three-dimensional finite-volume magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) solver for orthogonal curvilinear geometries. The solver advances magnetic fields using constrained transport to preserve $\nabla\!\cdot\!\mathbf{B}=0$ to machine precision and employs geometry-consistent high-order reconstruction with an enhanced Partial Donor Cell method (e-PDM) that accounts for geometry curvature. Flexible numerics include various numerical fluxes and time integrators. In axial symmetric coordinates, angular momentum are preserved to round-off, and a ring-averaging treatment near the axis relaxes CFL constraints while maintaining divergence-free magnetic fields. Optional capabilities include the semi-relativistic (Boris) correction, background-field splitting, and an anisotropic MHD formulation. Rewritten in C, the code adopts a modular design that simplifies case setup and facilitates the addition of physics modules and coupling to other first-principles codes. Standard benchmarks across multiple geometries verify the code's high accuracy, low numerical diffusion, and robust handling of coordinate singularities and rotating flows. GAMERA-OP provides a practical, high-order framework for space and astrophysical plasma applications where orthogonal curvilinear coordinates and exact angular-momentum conservation are advantageous.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the physical origin of star formation suppression in gas-rich early-type galaxies using five high-resolution hydrodynamical idealized galaxy simulations, performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO. These simulations include one Milky Way-like galaxy and four early-type galaxies, of which one early-type galaxy is found to have significantly less star formation despite a substantial molecular gas reservoir. We apply a modified virial theorem to the overdensities in each galaxy to quantify the forces regulating their stability and thus star formation. We find evidence that, in the suppressed galaxy, strong Coriolis forces driven by elevated galactic shear may inhibit gravitational collapse. This is caused by the galaxy's high central compactness, providing a physical mechanism for the suppression of star formation that does not require the removal of molecular gas. In contrast, less compact early-type galaxies host more gravity-dominated clouds and therefore exhibit higher star formation rates. However, we find that this gravitational stability occurs without significantly increasing the classical Toomre-Q parameter, and therefore a new criterion for suppressed star formation may be needed. We also discuss the impact of our choice of overdensity scale and connections to observations of molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a panchromatic optical-mm characterization of GNz7q, a recently identified X-ray weak, rapidly growing red quasar embedded within a dusty starburst galaxy at $z=7.1899$, using the full suite of JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, MIRI, and archival NOEMA observations. Our deep NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy reveals unambiguous broad Balmer emission (FWHM $=2221\pm20$kms$^{-1}$), confirming a super-Eddington accreting black hole ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}=2.7\pm0.4$) with a mass of $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot})=7.55\pm0.34$, using accretion-rate corrected BH mass estimators. After subtracting the point source, we robustly detect stellar emission from the host galaxy across multiple NIRCam and MIRI filters. Out joint morphological-spectral analysis yields a stellar mass of $\log (M_*/M_\odot)=10.5\pm0.4$ and an intense star formation rate of ${\rm SFR}=330\pm97\,M_\odot\,\rm yr^{-1}$, confirming the host as a massive, dusty starburst galaxy. We find that GNz7q lies on the local $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation ($M_{\rm BH}/M_*\simeq 0.001$) and is well positioned to evolve into the locus of massive SDSS quasars with $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)\approx 9$ and $M_*\approx 10^{11}\,M_\odot$ at $z\sim 6$, owing to its remarkably rapid growth in both the black hole and its host galaxy. This stands in stark contrast to many recently reported JWST AGN populations at similar redshifts, including the little red dots (LRDs), whose weak or undetected star formation makes it difficult for them to grow into the massive galaxies hosting SDSS-like quasars. These results suggest that GNz7q marks as a rare, pivotal phase of early BH-galaxy co-eolution, plausibly providing a crucial direct pathway to the supermassive black hole systems within the first billion years of the Universe.
#### Cosmological Simulation with Population III Stellar Feedback and Metal Enrichment I: Model Description And Convergence Test

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12460

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12460

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new Pop III + Pop II subgrid framework implemented in the moving-mesh code {\sc arepo}, designed to study the impact of Pop III feedback on star formation in the early universe. The framework combines primordial non-equilibrium chemistry, metal-line cooling, IMF-sampled stellar evolution with SN feedback, and approximate Lyman-Werner (LW) and ionizing radiation transport. We run a suite of $1c{\rm Mpc}/h$ box simulations with different initial conditions and resolutions from $z=127$ to $z=10$. The highest gas mass and spatial resolution in the fiducial simulation reach $\sim10\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and $\sim4\,{\rm pc}$, respectively. The model successfully reproduces the UV-inferred Pop II star formation rate density (SFRD) from recent JWST observations across all initial conditions, with only minor variation driven by local halo interactions and LW irradiation. We find that the volume filling factor of metal-enriched gas converges to $\sim1\%$ at $z=10$. Convergence is achieved once subhalos with $M_{\rm subhalo}\gtrsim 10^{6.5}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ are resolved, and the total stellar mass at $z=10$ is largely insensitive to initial conditions or the resolution considered in this work. A fiducial simulation requires $\sim 10^4$ CPU hours, making the framework computationally tractable for larger box simulations and enabling future large parameter studies of stellar physics or environment effects such as Pop III IMF variations, X-ray radiation, or the streaming velocity at high redshift.
#### Odd Radio Circles Modeled by Shock-Bubble Interactions

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12479

 - **Abstract**
 The physical nature and origins of the newly discovered class of Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) remain unclear. We investigate a model whereby ORCs are synchrotron-emitting vortex rings formed by the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) when a shock interacts with a low-density fossil radio lobe in the intergalactic medium using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. These rings initially exhibit oscillatory behavior that damps over time. We implement a new method to model Inverse-Compton cooling and synchrotron cooling at high frequencies in a scale-free manner, enabling us to test a wide range of model parameters against the observational constraints. We find that shock strengths of Mach 2-4 are consistent with the data, as expected in accretion, merger-driven, or active galactic nuclei-driven shocks. We find that the initial size of the bubbles required to explain the rings ranges from 140 to 250 kpc, with initial energy in the bubble of order $10^{57}-10^{59}$ erg, consistent with fossil lobes inflated by moderately powerful radio galaxies. Derived ambient pressures and densities place ORCs in low density environments, such as the outskirts of galaxy groups with ages of order 70-200 Myr. Our synthetic radio maps match the polarization properties of ORC1 and predict a dependency of the tangential magnetic field angle on the aspect ratio of ORCs. A key distinguishing trait of the RMI-driven vortex ring model is that it does not require the ORC to be centered on its host galaxy and is therefore redshift agnostic.
#### Guangqi: A two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic code with realistic equation of states

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12545

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12545

 - **Abstract**
 We present Guangqi, a new two-dimensional, finite-volume radiation hydrodynamics code designed for high-performance astrophysical simulations. The code simultaneously resolves the hydrodynamic equations for complex equations of state (EoS) and implicit radiation transport under the flux-limited diffusion approximation. Written in Fortran and parallelized via the Message Passing Interface. Guangqi supports analytic hydrogen and helium EoS under the assumption of local thermal and chemical equilibrium. The framework is compatible with both Cartesian and spherical-polar geometries -- utilizing non-uniform grid spacing -- and incorporates static (SMR) and adaptive mesh refinement to optimize computational efficiency. To address the inherent challenges of angular momentum conservation in spherical-polar coordinates, we implement a robust and consistent "passive scalar angular momentum algorithm" (PSAMA). Domain decomposition is managed through both Z-order and Hilbert space-filling curves to ensure scalability. The code has been rigorously verified against a suite of standard benchmarks and newly designed test cases specifically intended to diagnose the non-linear coupling between gas dynamics, intricate EoS, radiation transport, and angular momentum conservation.

 - **Abstract**
 JAXA's Hayabusa2 mission successfully returned samples from the asteroid Ryugu in December 2020. It executed two touchdowns to collect the surface and subsurface materials, one close to the crater created by an artificial impactor. The onboard camera system, Optical Navigation Camera (ONC), with two wide-angle cameras and one narrow-angle camera with seven color filters, was crucial for mapping geomorphology and composition such as hydrated minerals during navigation and scientific observation. More than 8,300 images revealed Ryugu's spinning-top shape and boulder-covered surface. However, most high-resolution images captured during descent/touchdown operations lacked precise location data and camera position/orientation information. Image geometry was refined using photogrammetric bundle adjustment. This method enabled the refinement of all high-resolution images captured during descent/touchdown operations. Furthermore, map-projected GeoTIFF images in GIS format containing geographic metadata were created for all ONC images, and these were integrated to construct global and regional mosaic maps. To facilitate scientific research on Ryugu, these refined image geometry information, maps, and mosaics are publicly available via this https URL

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery and characterization of a planetary companion in the microlensing event KMT-2016-BLG-1337, which was produced by a binary system of low-mass stars. The light curve of the event exhibits a short-term anomaly superposed on the profile of a binary-lens single-source (2L1S) model. To investigate the nature of this anomaly, we performed detailed modeling under both the binary-lens binary-source (2L2S) and triple-lens single-source (3L1S) interpretations. The 3L1S model provides a substantially better fit to the data, strongly favoring the presence of a planetary companion in the lens system. Two viable $3L1S$ solutions describe the event nearly equally well. In one solution, the planet has a mass of $M_3 \sim 0.3~M_{\mathrm{J}}$ and lies at a projected separation of $a_{\perp,3} \sim 4~{\rm au}$ from the heavier member of the host binary. In the alternative solution, the planet has a mass of $M_3 \sim 7~M_{\mathrm{J}}$ and a projected separation of $a_{\perp,3} \sim 1.5~{\rm au}$. The host binary consists of early M-type dwarfs with masses of $M_1 \sim 0.54~M_\odot$ and $M_2 \sim 0.40~M_\odot$, separated in projection by $a_{\perp,2} \sim 3.5~{\rm au}$. The system is located at a distance of $D_{\rm L} \sim 7~{\rm kpc}$ toward the Galactic bulge. This event demonstrates the sensitivity of microlensing to planets in dynamically complex stellar environments, including systems beyond the reach of other detection techniques. It thereby contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of planet formation in multiple-star systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio relics in merging galaxy clusters are widely interpreted as synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons accelerated at large-scale shocks. However, the efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is expected to be reduced in the low-Mach-number, weakly turbulent environments characteristic of cluster merger shocks, and recent results suggest that DSA itself may not constitute a viable physical mechanism. In this work, we investigate ballistic surfing acceleration (BSA) as an electrodynamically grounded mechanism for electron energization that does not rely on prescribed diffusion coefficients. We formulate BSA under typical cluster shock conditions and derive the balance between coherent acceleration by the shock convection electric field and radiative losses due to synchrotron and inverse-Compton cooling. This balance determines both the maximum electron energy and the resulting steady-state spectrum. By forward-modeling the associated synchrotron emission and comparing it with integrated radio observations of the Sausage and Toothbrush relics, we find that the observed spectral curvature and high-frequency steepening can be reproduced when only a very small fraction ($\sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-8}$) of the available BSA acceleration capacity contributes to systematic electron energization. Despite this extremely small efficiency, it is sufficient to accelerate electrons to Lorentz factors $\gamma \sim 10^4 - 10^5$ under cluster conditions. These results suggest that radio relics provide a promising astrophysical laboratory for probing coherent acceleration, and that the BSA framework may account for the production of relativistic electrons in cluster shocks.
#### ALMA Band 9 CO(6--5) Reveals a Warm Ring Structure Associated with the Embedded Protostar in the Cold Dense Core MC 27/L1521F

 - **Abstract**
 Infall and outflows, coupled with magnetic fields, rapidly structure the gas around newborn protostars. Shocks from interacting components encode the temperature and density distribution, offering a direct probe of the earliest evolution history. However, interferometric observations characterizing warm envelopes using high-excitation lines remain scarce. We present ALMA Band 9 observations of the Taurus dense core MC 27/L1521F, which hosts a Class 0 protostar, targeting the CO($J$=6-5) line at an angular resolution of $\sim$2\arcsec\ ($\approx$300 au). We detect an off-centered ring-like structure with a diameter of $\sim$1000 au that was not identifiable in previous low-$J$ CO data, where emission close to the systemic velocity is strongly affected by optical depth. The ring shows a typical peak brightness temperature of $\sim$3 K at our resolution. Excitation considerations indicate that the detected CO($J$=6-5) emission likely arises from relatively warm ($T \gtrsim 20$ K) and dense ($n({\rm H_2}) \gtrsim 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas embedded within the surrounding cold, dense core. The morphology and kinematics suggest an energetic and localized shock-heating event, potentially linked to dynamical gas--magnetic-field interactions in the earliest protostellar phase. Our results demonstrate that high-$J$ CO observations provide a powerful new window on warm and dense gas components, enabling a more direct view of the physical processes operating at the onset of star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars significantly contribute to the chemical composition of the universe. In their outflows, complex chemistry takes place, which critically depends on the local temperature. Therefore, if we want to accurately model the AGB environment, we need accurate cooling rates. The CO molecule is abundant in AGB outflows, and has a dipole moment, which enables it to cool through emission from its rotational transitions. We therefore expect it to significantly contribute to cooling in this environment, even at low temperatures ($10$ K $\leqslant T\leqslant 3000$ K). Currently, CO cooling rates are available for ISM-like conditions, which encompasses a different parameter regime, with generally lower densities and velocity gradients, compared to AGB winds. Therefore, these ISM cooling rates might not be applicable to the AGB regime. In this paper, we compute CO cooling rates for hydrodynamics simulations of AGB outflows. To evaluate the net cooling rate, we calculate the energy level distribution of CO self-consistently, using the non Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (NLTE) line radiative transfer code Magritte. We verify whether already existing CO cooling rate prescriptions for the interstellar medium (ISM) are applicable for this regime. We noticed minor differences between these prescriptions and our calculated cooling rates in general. However, when used far outside their originally intended parameter regimes, significant differences occur. Therefore, we propose a new CO cooling rate prescription for the AGB environment and we study how the computed cooling rate varies depending on input parameters.
#### Upper limit on HF(1-0) absorption in a dusty star-forming galaxy at $z = 6$: Constraints on early fluorine enrichment

 - **Abstract**
 Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars have recently attracted attention as possible drivers of early chemical enrichment, including the production of fluorine, whose nucleosynthetic origin remains debated. To test the contribution of massive stars to fluorine production in the early Universe, we conducted Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band~5 spectroscopy of the HF(1-0) absorption line toward a dusty star-forming galaxy at $z=6.024$. This galaxy has a known gas-phase metallicity and is too young for low-mass AGB stars to have contributed significantly, providing a clean environment to isolate massive-star yields. We do not detect significant HF absorption ($\sim2\sigma$) and derive a conservative 5$\sigma$ upper limit of $N_\mathrm{HF}/N_\mathrm{H_2} < 2.2\times10^{-9}$. This limit is about an order of magnitude below typical local measurements, indicating inefficient fluorine enrichment $\sim0.9$\,Gyr after the Big Bang. Comparison with chemical evolution models shows that our constraint is consistent with scenarios without WR yields at this epoch. Expanding the sample of HF absorption measurements in high-redshift galaxies with well-characterized metallicities will be crucial for tracing the onset of WR enrichment and fluorine production across cosmic time.
#### Gaps and Rings: A Near-Universal Trait of Extended Protoplanetary Discs

 - **Abstract**
 Substructures such as rings, gaps, and cavities are commonly observed in protoplanetary discs and are thought to play a key role in dust evolution and planet formation. However, a fraction of the extended discs (68% dust radii > 30 AU) in nearby star-forming regions remain unresolved, leaving their substructure content uncertain and thereby limiting our understanding of dust evolution and the initial conditions for planet formation across the full disc population. We aim to investigate the presence of substructures in previously unresolved, extended discs to assess whether all extended protoplanetary discs in the Solar neighbourhood exhibit substructures. We present new high-resolution ($\sim$0.12") ALMA Band 6 continuum observations at 1.33 mm of 26 previously unresolved, extended discs within 200 pc, completing the high-resolution sample of extended discs in Taurus, Ophiuchus, Chamaeleon, Lupus, Upper Scorpius, Upper Centaurus-Lupus and Lower Centaurus-Crux. We analyse radial intensity profiles using Frankenstein and Galario to detect substructures. Seventeen discs show clear substructures, while nine appear compact and structureless, smooth or ambiguous due to inclination or possible binarity/late-stage infall. We detect $^{12}$CO J=2-1 emission in 15 discs, with extended emission in four. Combined with literature data, our complete sample of 730 protoplanetary discs reveals that nearly all extended discs exhibit substructures, $\sim$91% detected in the full sample, and up to $\sim$98% when correcting for high-inclination systems where substructures may be hidden. Substructures are a near-universal feature of extended protoplanetary discs. They are more commonly detected in larger, massive discs and around higher-mass stars, and structured discs retain their dust mass over time. This supports the scenario in which dust traps, possibly induced by giant planets, shape disc morphologies.

 - **Abstract**
 The Magellanic Clouds (MCs) offer a unique laboratory for studying galaxy interaction and the evolution of dwarf galaxies. By investigating when and how stars formed, the star formation history (SFH) is a powerful tool to provide constraints for dynamical modeling of the system's past interactions and understand the processes of stripping and triggered star formation in tidally influenced environments. We aim to reconstruct the SFH of the Magellanic Bridge, the gaseous and stellar stream connecting the two Clouds. We used data from the deep optical STEP survey, which covers 54 $\mathrm{deg\, {^{2}}}$ across the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and the Bridge, reaching stars below the oldest main sequence turnoff at the distance of the MCs. We applied the synthetic color-magnitude diagram (CMD) technique to 14 deg$^2$ of STEP data. We constructed two libraries of synthetic stellar populations based on the PARSEC-COLIBRI and BaSTI stellar evolutionary models, with metallicities in the range $-2.0\leq[$Fe/H$]\leq0$ across the whole Hubble time. We find a clear peak of recent star formation $\sim100$ Myr ago in the Magellanic Bridge, which becomes increasingly pronounced toward the SMC. The low metallicity of this population suggests that it formed from gas stripped from the SMC during its most recent close encounter with the LMC. In the eastern part of the Bridge (LMC side), the star formation peaks at earlier times, around 10 Gyr and 2 Gyr ago. We estimate a total stellar mass in the Bridge of $ (5.1 \pm 0.2) \times 10^5 M_\odot$ and a present-day stellar metallicity of $[$Fe/H$]\sim0.6$ dex, close to SMC value.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of TIC-65910228 b / NGTS-38 b, a giant exoplanet with a radius of $1.081\pm0.047$ R$_\text{J}$ and a mass of $4.78_{-0.37}^{+0.40}$ M$_\text{J}$ on a long-period ($180.52791\pm0.00038$ day), moderately eccentric ($e=0.308\pm0.011$) orbit transiting a bright (V=$10.230\pm0.020$ mag) metal rich ([Fe/H]=$0.33\pm0.09$, 'dex') F6V-F7V type host star. The planet was initially detected from a single transit in TESS Sector 33. A photometric monitoring campaign of 228 nights with NGTS detected a transit egress of the planet, which together with spectroscopic radial velocity monitoring with CORALIE and HARPS identified an orbital period of ~180.5,d. These radial velocity measurements also showed the mass of the companion to be planetary. Additional transit observations coordinated by the TESS follow-up observing program allowed further confirmation and refinement of this period. With its relatively cool equilibrium temperature of $458\pm11$,K, NGTS-38 b joins a small but growing population of well characterised transiting warm-Jupiters and has one of the longest periods of any discovered to date. The target is situated in the LOPS2 field of the upcoming PLATO mission which will allow for greater refinement of the system parameters and potential for the discovery of additional companions too small and/or too long-period to be seen by TESS or NGTS. NGTS-38 b's bright host star and wide orbital separation make it an attractive target for further study, including potential measurement of its spin-orbit alignment or targeted exomoon/ring searches.

 - **Abstract**
 Post-starburst (PSB) galaxies, having recently experienced a starburst followed by rapid quenching, are excellent laboratories to probe physical mechanisms that drive starbursts and shutting down of star formation. Integral-field spectroscopy reveals the galaxies' spatially-resolved properties, where observed directional patterns can be linked to the galaxies' past evolution. We measure the resolved star-formation histories (SFHs), stellar metallicity evolution and dust properties of three local PSBs from the MaNGA survey, down to $0.5$" resolution ($\sim0.3\,$kpc) using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Local parameters were constrained simultaneously with parameters describing spatial trends. We found that all three galaxies first experienced an outer, weaker and slower quenching starburst, followed by a central, stronger and faster quenching starburst that peaked $\sim 1\,$Gyr after the first. The central starbursts induced a significantly stronger rise in stellar metallicity compared to the outer starbursts. These results are consistent with the effects of a recent gas-rich (wet) merger, where the first pericentre passage triggered starbursts in the outer regions, while the later coalescence triggers a stronger centralised starburst. We find non-axisymmetric features in the maps of burst mass fraction and dust attenuation in all galaxies, which could be caused by tidal effects during the recent merger. Comparisons with literature binary merger simulations suggests that the galaxies' rapid quenching was driven by gas consumption and the stabilisation against gas gravitational collapse by a growing spheroid, while AGN feedback was not necessarily a primary cause.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how the H$_2$ ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) and dueterium fractionation in star-forming regions are affected by nuclear spin conversion (NSC) on dust grains. Particular focus is placed on the rotational energy difference between ortho-H$_2$ (o-H$_2$) and para-H$_2$ (p-H$_2$) on grain surfaces. While the ground state of o-H$_2$ has a higher rotational energy than that of p-H$_2$ by 170.5 K in the gas phase, this energy difference is expected to become smaller on solid surfaces, where interactions between the surface and adsorbed H$_2$ molecules affect their rotational motion. A previous study by Furuya et al. (2019) developed a rigorous formulation of the rate for the temporal variation of the H$_2$ OPR via the NSC on grains, assuming that adsorbed o-H$_2$ has higher rotational energy than adsorbed p-H$_2$ by 170.5 K, as in the gas phase. In this work, we relax the assumption and re-evaluate the rate, varying the rotational energy difference between their ground states. The re-evaluated rate is incorporated into a gas-ice astrochemical model to study the evolution of the H$_2$ OPR and the deuterium fractionation in prestellar cores and the outer, cold regions of protostellar envelopes. The inclusion of the NSC on grains reduces the timescale of the H2 OPR evolution and thus the deuterium fractionation, at densities of >10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures of <14-16 K (depending on the rotational energy difference), when the ionization rate of H$_2$ is 10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Using long-term observations from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) along with spectroscopic observations from the 3.6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT), we present a comprehensive time-series and spectral analysis of the intermediate polar V515 And. Our analysis reveals that V515 And resides within the period gap, with the detection of its orbital period of 2.73116 h. Additionally, we confirm the earlier findings of the spin and beat periods to be 465.4721 s and 488.6067 s, respectively. The time-resolved timing analysis reveals that V515 And undergoes changes in its accretion geometry, not only between different TESS sectors but also within individual sector observations. The system exhibits a transition in the dominant accretion mode, switching between disc-fed and stream-fed accretion. In the TESS light curve, we identify two successive outburst-like episodes, each persisting for roughly a day and reaching peak luminosities of $2.7\times10^{33}$ and $1.9\times10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Our analysis suggests that these bursts belong to the recently proposed class of micronovae. The optical spectrum of V515 And is characterised by strong Balmer and He II emission lines and shows an inverse Balmer decrement indicating the magnetic nature of the source.
