 - **Abstract**
 Ultra hot Jupiters (UHJs) present a promising pathway for drawing a link between a planet's composition and formation history. They retain both refractory and volatiles species in gas phase in their atmospheres, which allows us to place unique constraints on their building blocks. Here, we present the 0.2 - 1.7 $\mu$m transmission spectrum of KELT-20 b/MASCARA-2 b taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Unlike other UHJs around early-type stars, KELT-20 b's orbit is well aligned with its host star's spin axis and we test whether its distinct dynamical configuration is reflected in its composition. We observe a tremendous rise (>10 scale heights) in the planet's transit depth at the near-UV wavelengths, akin to that observed for WASP-178 b and WASP-121 b, and a muted water absorption feature in the near-IR. Our retrievals indicate that the large NUV depth is driven by Fe II and/or SiO and that the water is mostly thermally dissociated. Assuming equilibrium chemistry, we obtain constraints on Z/H and O/H that indicate accretion of volatile-rich solids and/or gas. Both our low resolution spectrum and the refractory elemental ratios from Gandhi et al. 2023 suggest that nightside condensation and rainout are limited to only the most refractory species in the planet's atmosphere. Within the precision limits of the HST spectra, no strong evidence for limb asymmetry is detected. We contextualize this lack of asymmetry by comparing to predictions from general circulation models with and without the effects of kinematic magnetohydrodynamics. Lastly, we find no major differences in the HST transmission spectra of KELT-20 b, WASP-178, and WASP-121 b despite their different dynamical configurations.

 - **Abstract**
 Extended Ly$\alpha$ emission is commonly observed around star-forming galaxies, opening a window for probing the neutral hydrogen gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). In this paper, we develop a prescription of spherically symmetric CGM gas properties and build emulators to model circularly-averaged surface brightness (SB) profiles of the extended Ly$\alpha$ emission. With CGM gas properties parametrized by the density, velocity, and temperature profiles, a self-shielding calculation is carried out to obtain the neutral gas distribution with ionizing photons from the ultraviolet (UV) background and star formation in the galaxy. Our calculation reveals three types of systems with distinct neutral gas distribution: non-shielded systems with the CGM being highly ionized across all radii, shielded systems with a neutral gas shell shielding the UV background, and transitional systems in between. Ly$\alpha$ SB profiles are obtained through Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer (RT) simulations, performed for the CGM models with three kinds of Ly$\alpha$ sources: the star formation from central and satellite galaxies, and the recombination in the CGM. We build emulators to efficiently predict Ly$\alpha$ SB profiles for given model parameters and Ly$\alpha$ sources, based on Gaussian process regression. After being trained with only 180 RT simulations for each Ly$\alpha$ source, the emulators reach an overall accuracy at the level of $\sim 20$ per cent. By applying the emulators to fit mock Ly$\alpha$ SB profiles constructed from our model, we find a reasonable recovery of model parameters, indicating the potential of extracting physical information of the CGM and galaxies from the observed extended Ly$\alpha$ emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We present detections of auroral emission lines of [OIII], [OII], [SIII], and [SII] in deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for 41 star-forming galaxies at $z=1.4-7.2$ from the AURORA survey. We combine these new observations with 98 star-forming galaxies at $z=1.3-10.6$ with detected auroral lines drawn from the literature to form a sample of 139 high-redshift galaxies with robust electron temperature and direct-method oxygen abundance determinations. This sample notably covers a wider dynamic range in metallicity than previous work, spanning $0.02-0.9$~Z$_\odot$. We calibrate empirical relations between 19 emission-line ratios and oxygen abundance, providing a robust tool set to infer accurate gas-phase metallicities of high-redshift galaxies when auroral lines are not detected. While calibrations based on lines of $\alpha$ elements (O, Ne, S, Ar) appear reliable, we find significant scatter in calibrations involving lines of N driven by a high dispersion in N/O at fixed O/H, suggesting that N-based line ratios are less reliable tracers of the oxygen abundance at high redshift. These new high-redshift calibrations are notably offset from those based on typical $z\sim0$ galaxy and HII region samples, and are better matched by samples of extreme local galaxies that are analogs of high-redshift sources. The new metallicity calibrations presented in this work pave the way for robust studies of galaxy chemical evolution in the early Universe, leading to a better understanding of baryon cycling and galaxy formation from Cosmic Noon through the Epoch of Reionization.
#### PLATOSpec's first results: planets WASP-35b and TOI-622b are on aligned orbits, and K2-237b is on a polar orbit

 - **Abstract**
 The spin-orbit angle between a stellar spin axis and its planetary orbital axis is a key diagnostic of planetary migration pathways, yet the mechanisms shaping the observed spin-orbit distribution remain incompletely understood. Combining the spin-orbit angle with atmospheric measurements has emerged as a powerful method of studying exoplanets that showcases the synergy between ground- and space-based observations. We present the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect measurements of the projected spin-orbit angle ($\lambda$) for three gaseous exoplanets using the newly commissioned PLATOSpec instrument on the E152 Telescope at La Silla Observatory. For WASP-35b, we determine $\lambda = 1_{-18}^{+19}$ deg, demonstrating PLATOSpec's capabilities through excellent agreement with HARPS-N literature data. We provide the first spin-orbit measurements for TOI-622b ($\lambda =-4 \pm 12$ deg, true spin-orbit angle $\psi = $16.1$^{+8.0}_{-9.7}$ deg), revealing an aligned orbit consistent with quiescent disc migration. For K2-237b, we find $\lambda = 91 \pm 7$ deg and $\psi = $90.5$^{+6.8}_{-6.2}$ deg, indicating a nearly perfect polar orbit, which suggests a history consistent with disc-free migration, contrasting previous studies inferring disc migration. TOI-622b populates a sparsely populated region of sub-Jovian planets with measured spin-orbit angles orbiting stars above the Kraft break, while K2-237b's polar configuration strengthens tentative evidence for preferential orbital orientations. All three systems are compelling targets for future atmospheric characterization, where these dynamical constraints will be vital for a comprehensive understanding of their formation and evolution.
#### Forbush Decreases during strong Geomagnetic Storms: Time Delays, Rigidity Effects, and ICME-Driven Modulation

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the relationship between Forbush decreases (FDs) and associated geomagnetic storms, and their links to interplanetary solar wind parameters, using high-resolution minute data. FDs are classified by main-phase decrease steps and analyzed with superposed epoch analysis. Fast, turbulent, high-field sheath structures occur before and during coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven FDs, whereas corotating interaction region events show delayed amplification and more perturbed dynamics. Time lags between FD and storm onsets are examined for space weather forecasting. FD amplitude correlates more strongly with moderate and strong CME-driven storms than with extreme storms, likely due to complex magnetospheric responses from successive events and prolonged southward IMF Bz. Events with fast shocks and sheath regions show stronger correlations than those without shocks. Energy dependence, derived from twelve neutron monitor stations worldwide, reveals a two-step linear rigidity spectrum: sharp FD amplitude decrease at low rigidity and a more gradual drop at higher rigidity.

 - **Abstract**
 The Compton Spectrometer and Imager is an upcoming NASA space telescope in the MeV range. COSI's primary science goals include precisely mapping nuclear line and positron annihilation emission in the Milky Way galaxy through Compton imaging. This relies on our ability to maintain COSI's spectral performance over its mission lifetime. Changes to the detectors' gain characteristics over time will result in a non-linear stretching of the entire energy range. Moreover, observations from past MeV telescopes and proton-beam experiments have shown that radiation damage in space causes photopeak shifts and spectral line broadening. These necessitate a plan for regular, in-orbit calibration. In this study, we demonstrate a method to monitor and recalibrate the COSI detectors using background line emissions produced by the space radiation environment. We employ Monte Carlo simulations of particle background and show that strong background lines arise from nuclear excitation of COSI's detectors (germanium) and cryostat (aluminum) materials. These span COSI's entire bandwidth for single-site interactions and can be used to monitor the effects of radiation damage and gain shifts every eight hours at the full instrument level and every 24 days at the individual detector level. Methods developed by Pike et al. to correct the effects of hole trapping and gain characteristics can then be applied to recover the original spectral performance. These results inform COSI's telemetry requirements for calibration and housekeeping data, and rule out the need for an on-board radioactive calibration source which would have increased the complexity of the spacecraft.
#### Revisiting G29.862-0.0044: a jet cavity disrupted by an outflow in a likely young stellar object wide binary system

 - **Abstract**
 A few years ago, we investigated MYSO G29.862-0.0044 (YSO-G29), an intriguing star-forming region at a distance of 6.2 kpc. Although the typical disc-jet scenario was proposed to explain the observations, it remained far from conclusive. YSO-G29 was analysed using new observations at near-IR from Gemini-NIFS, at radio continuum (10 GHz) from Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and new continuum (1.3 mm) and molecular line data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The near-IR observations allowed us to detect emission of H2 1-0 S(1) and Br-gamma lines in YSO-G29, which are compatible with excitation and ionization from UV radiation propagating in a highly perturbed ambient. In addition, some evidence of H2 excitation by collisions were found. The ALMA data show the presence of a conspicuous and collimated molecular outflow propagating southwards, while to the north, an extended molecular feature perfectly surrounded by the Ks near-IR emission appears. The continuum emission at 1.3 mm allowed us to better resolve the molecular cores, one of which stands out due to its high temperatures and rich chemical composition. From the JVLA observations, we discovered a compact radio continuum source, a likely compact Hii region or an ionised jet of a massive protostar, located at ~0.7 arcsec (~ 0.02 pc) from the main millimetre core. In this way, we propose a YSO wide binary system. {We can explain the nature of the intriguing near-IR features previously observed: cone-like structures produced by jets/winds of one of the components of the binary system that cleared out the surroundings were disrupted by a molecular outflow probably from the other component. These results complete the picture of what is happening in YSO-G29, and reveal a phenomenon that should be considered when investigating massive star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new scheme to couple existing numerical methods for elastic self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) to the hydrodynamic equations via a continuous function of the local Knudsen number. The method, an SIDM-hydro hybrid (SHH), allows more efficient simulation of the evolution of inhomogeneous halos deep into the regime of gravothermal collapse. With the improved efficiency gained by moving to a hydrodynamical description in high-density regions, the SHH method allows central densities of two orders of magnitude higher to be reached in considerably less simulation time than traditional methods. Our implementation should be considered as the first step toward a robust SHH method, as we interpolate the first and second moments of the Boltzmann equation in the ideal-fluid limit only. The simulation results are qualitatively similar to those found with other methods, although there are differences in the implementation of the primary physics driving the dynamics, and in the details of the resulting halo profiles. However, our results indicate that the SHH technique shows promise to investigate gravothermal collapse in diverse, dynamical environments. The method can be extended to incorporate non-ideal fluid terms and dissipation, as needed for dark-matter scenarios where interactions beyond the elastic regime may be important in the dense interiors of some halos.
#### Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS): Evolution of the Morphology-Density Relation

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies with different morphological characteristics likely have different evolutionary histories, such that understanding the mechanisms that drive morphological change can provide valuable insights into the galaxy evolution process. These mechanisms largely correlate with local environment, ultimately leading to the well-known local morphology-density relation. To explore how the morphology-density relation is produced, we must look to earlier times, and trace the co-evolution of environment and morphology in an un-biased and self-consistent manner. Here we use new environmental metrics from the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) to explore the spectroscopic morphology-density relation at intermediate redshift (0.3<z<0.5) and compare directly to the Galaxy And Mass Assembly Survey (GAMA) at 0<z<0.08. Importantly, both the galaxy morphologies and environmental metrics in DEVILS and GAMA are derived in a very similar manner, reducing any methodology biases. We see a clear evolution in morphological classes between DEVILS and GAMA, which is modulated by environment. These trends are consistent with a scenario where in all environments disk-dominated galaxies are transitioning to classical bulge+disk systems (potentially via minor mergers and/or secular evolution), and in high-density environments there is an increasing prevalence of visually-selected elliptical galaxies (potentially via major mergers and/or disk fading); with the fraction of ellipticals increasing by ~0.3 in the most dense regions over the last ~7Gyr, but remaining largely unchanged in low-density environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a perfect liquid drop at equilibrium is extended to rotating systems with a small frequency $\omega $ within the effective-surface (ES) approach. The gradient surface terms of the NS energy density $\cal{E}(\rho)$ [Equation of State] are taken into account along with the volume ones at the leading order of the leptodermic parameter $a/R << 1$, where $a$ is the ES crust thickness and $R$ is the mean NS radius. The macroscopic NS angular momentum at small frequencies $\omega$ is specified for calculations of the adiabatic moment of inertia (MI) within the Kerr metric coordinate approach in the outer Boyer-Lindquist and inner Hogan forms. The NS MI, $\Theta=\tilde{\Theta}/(1-\cal{G}_{t\varphi})$, was obtained in terms of the statistically averaged MI, $\tilde{\Theta}$, and its time and azimuthal-angle correlation, $\cal{G}_{t\varphi}$, as sums of the volume and surface components. The MI $\Theta$ depends dramatically on its effective radius $R$ because of strong gravitation and surface effects. We found the significant shift of the Schwarzschild radius due to the correlation term $\cal{G}_{t\varphi}$. With this term, the adiabaticity condition fails for the NS J0740+6620, with the mass about $M_\odot$ for a strong gravitation, in contrast to the NS J0030+0451 for smaller mass, and many other NSs.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way exhibits extreme conditions, including high gas densities, elevated temperatures, enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rates, and large-scale dynamics. Large-scale molecular surveys reveal increasing chemical and physical complexity in the CMZ. A key step to interpreting the molecular richness found in the CMZ is to build chemical templates tailored to its diverse conditions. The combined impact of high ionization, elevated temperatures, and dense gas remains insufficiently explored for observable tracers. In this study, we utilized UCLCHEM, a gas-grain time-dependent chemical model, to link physical conditions with their corresponding molecular signatures and identify key tracers of temperature, density, ionization, and shock activity. We ran a grid of models of shocks and protostellar objects representative of typical CMZ conditions, focusing on twenty-four species, including complex organic molecules. Shocked and protostellar environments show distinct evolutionary timescales ($\lesssim 10^4$ vs. $\gtrsim 10^4$ years), with 300 K emerging as a key temperature threshold for chemical differentiation. We find that cosmic-ray ionization and temperature are the main drivers of chemical trends. HCO$^+$, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$SH trace ionization, while HCO, HCO$^+$, CH$_3$SH, CH$_3$NCO, and HCOOCH$_3$ show consistent abundance contrasts between shocks and protostellar regions over similar temperature ranges. While our models underpredict some complex organics in shocks, they reproduce observed trends for most species, supporting scenarios involving recurring shocks in Galactic Center clouds and enhanced ionization towards Sgr B2(N2). Future work should assess the role of shock recurrence and metallicity in shaping chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic reconnection drives a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, including geomagnetic storms, solar flares, and activity in blazars. However, direct measurement of key reconnection observables remains challenging due to the remote and extreme nature of these environments. While high-energy particle showers observed on Earth are often attributed to reconnection, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, and clear diagnostic signatures are lacking. We present a theoretical, data-driven approach for identifying reconnection radiation signatures and enabling remote diagnostics of reconnection in astrophysical settings through radiation spectra. Using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of magnetic reconnection, we generate radiation spectra and establish connections between spectral features and the underlying reconnection dynamics. We develop a method to estimate the ratio of the reconnection electric field to the plasmoid magnetic field from spectral data. Analytic calculations show that other parameters can be extracted in the ultra-relativistic reconnection regime, such as the magnetic field or the current sheet width.
#### Stars Born in the Wind: M82's Outflow and Halo Star Formation

 - **Abstract**
 Starburst galaxies, like M82, launch kiloparsec-scale galactic outflows that interact with the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in complex ways. Apart from enriching the CGM with metals and energy, these outflows may trigger star formation in the halo -- either by driving shocks into the CGM or transporting cold, star-forming gas. To investigate such processes, we analyze the star formation history (SFH) of the Southern Arcs -- arc-like stellar features located ~5 kpc from M82's star-forming disk along the minor axis -- using Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 photometry. From resolved stellar populations, we derive SFHs over the last ~500 Myr, finding that ~85% of the stellar mass formed between ~150 and ~70 Myr ago, followed by a brief pause, with the remaining ~15% forming since ~30 Myr ago. The two stellar populations are co-spatial on scales of at least ~200 pc. The timing of the ~100 Myr burst aligns with star formation in the M82 disk and the age distribution of its star clusters, suggesting a causal link between the disk starburst and halo star formation. We explore two mechanisms that could explain these observations. In the first, shocks driven by the interaction between hot outflowing gas and cooler CGM material compress dense clouds, triggering collapse and star formation. In the second, stars form directly within massive, cool clouds associated with the outflow. As these clouds move ballistically through the halo, subsequent interactions with tidal debris may trigger additional star formation, producing the observed episodic structure.
