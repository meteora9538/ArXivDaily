#### Tidally driven inertial waves enhance eccentricity damping and spin evolution in planets and stars

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal interactions influence the orbital motions of binary star systems and extrasolar planets alike. Tides also affect stellar and planetary rotation rates. We demonstrate that in addition to altering spin synchronization and pseudosynchronization, tidally driven inertial waves in the convective envelopes of low-mass stars and gas giant planets can enhance tidal eccentricity damping. Analytically, we find that eccentricity damping by inertial waves can be orders of magnitude faster than equilibrium tides, independent of any eddy viscosity prescription. We use simplified numerical experiments to demonstrate this enhancement, and to explore the effects of different mixing length treatments of convective turbulence, as well as a spin-down torque from magnetic braking. These calculations demonstrate that tidally driven inertial waves can produce an extended cool core of nearly circular binaries, helping to reconcile a longstanding discrepancy between observed and predicted main-sequence binary circularization. Our calculations additionally suggest that tidally driven inertial waves may leave identifiable signatures in the ratios of orbital to rotation periods for stellar binaries, including synchronous and sub-synchronous rotation periods reminiscent of populations identified in Kepler, TESS, and Gaia data.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations have revealed a population of red, compact, high-redshift objects called 'Little Red Dots'(LRD), whose host components have remained largely unconstrained, possibly due to their extreme compactness. Current morphological studies have been limited by small samples, as well as by insufficient imaging depth, which may not allow reliable separation between point-like and extended components, leaving the existence and properties of extended components in LRD largely unconstrained. Here, we perform the image stacking analysis of 217 LRDs in four NIRCam bands, representing the largest and homogeneous sample observed from COSMOS-Web survey to date. Our results reveal an unambiguous detection of faint extended emission in the F444W band, with a typical size of ~200 parsecs and magnitude of ~27.7 AB at z~6.5. We perform four-band photometric SED fitting based on galaxy templates and derive a stellar mass of 8.91+-~0.1 logM_sun. Given this stellar mass, the host galaxy is compact, i.e., ~2.5 times smaller than star-forming populations at similar mass, and the typical black hole mass of LRDs is elevated by ~1.5 dex above the local MBH-M* relation. This work provides direct observational evidence for the existence of LRD host galaxies and offers crucial insights into the growth of the host galaxy and the co-evolution of galaxies and their black holes within the first billion years after the Big Bang.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the diversity of star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies is key to reconstructing their evolutionary paths. Traditional models often assume parametric forms such as delayed-tau or exponentially declining models, which may not reflect the actual variety of formation processes. We aim to assess what types of SFHs are consistent with the observed present-day star formation rates (${\text{SFR}}_0$) and time-averaged star formation rates ($\langle \text{SFR} \rangle$) of galaxies in the Local Volume, without assuming any fixed functional form. We construct a non-parametric framework by generating large ensembles of randomized SFHs for each galaxy in the sample. For each SFH, we compute its predicted stellar mass and present-day SFR and retain only those consistent with the observed values within a 20% tolerance. We then infer the statistical distribution of power-law slopes $\eta$ (fitted as ${\text{SFR}}(t) \propto (t-t_{\text{start}})^\eta$) and 50% stellar mass formation times $t_{50}$. Both $\eta$ and $t_{50}$ correlate strongly with the SFR ratio (Spearman $\rho > 0.75$, $p \ll 10^{-16}$), indicating that the shape and timing of star formation are primarily governed by this ratio. The $t_{50}$ distribution shows sharp spikes near 7.74 and 7.86 Gyr, which we attribute to grid discretization combined with filtering, rather than a physical bimodality. Our results confirm that strongly declining SFH templates are disfavored in the Local Volume: most systems are consistent with flat long-term SFHs, with only mild decline or occasional rising. Importantly, this is demonstrated through a fully model-independent, data-driven approach, with per-galaxy uncertainties quantified using the standard error of $\eta$ and $t_{50}$ from the ensemble of accepted SFHs.
#### Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE) XI: Circumgalactic O VI Emission Traces Clumpy Inflowing Recycled Gas

 - **Abstract**
 The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is host to gas flows into and out of galaxies and regulates galaxy growth, but the multiphase, diffuse gas in this region is challenging to observe. We investigate the properties of gas giving rise to O VI emission from the CGM that upcoming missions, such as the Aspera SmallSat, will be able to map in local galaxies. We use the FOGGIE simulations to predict the O VI emission from edge-on galaxies across the redshift range $z=1\rightarrow0$. O VI emission is brightest surrounding small, clumpy structures near the galaxy where the gas density is high. Most of the O VI surface brightness originates from collisionally ionized, $T\sim10^{5.5}$ K, inflowing gas and is not preferentially aligned with the major or minor axis of the galaxy disk. Simulated galaxies with higher halo masses, higher median CGM gas density, and higher star formation rates produce brighter and more widespread O VI emission in their CGM. We show that while O VI emission primarily originates in inflowing gas, turning off outflows in a simulation without star formation feedback eliminates most of the O VI emission. Enrichment from feedback is necessary to mix with the inflowing gas and allow it to glow in O VI. Collectively, our findings point towards a picture where O VI emission traces warm, ionized envelopes of cooler clouds that are accreting onto the galaxy in a metal-enriched galactic fountain. Finally, we show that the detection limit of Aspera is sufficient to detect O VI emission tens of kpc from the galaxy center for $\sim L^\star$ galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the implementation of an anisotropic viscosity solver within the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) framework of the TreeSPH code OpenGadget3. The solver models anisotropic viscous transport along magnetic field lines following the Braginskii formulation and includes physically motivated limiters based on the mirror and firehose instability thresholds, which constrain the viscous stress in weakly collisional plasmas. To validate the implementation, we performed a suite of standard test problems -- including two variants of the sound-wave test, circularly and linearly polarized Alfven waves, fast magnetosonic wave, and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability -- both with and without the plasma-instability limiters. The results show excellent agreement with the AREPO implementation of a similar anisotropic viscosity model (Berlok et al. 2019), confirming the accuracy and robustness of our method. Our formulation integrates seamlessly within the individual adaptive timestepping framework of OpenGadget3, avoiding the need for subcycling. This provides efficient and stable time integration while maintaining physical consistency. Finally, we applied the new solver to a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a galaxy cluster, demonstrating its capability to model anisotropic transport and plasma microphysics in realistic large-scale environments. Our implementation offers a versatile and computationally efficient tool for studying anisotropic viscosity in magnetized astrophysical systems.
#### WOCS XCIII: NGC 7789: the Evolution of Li, Stellar Rotation, and Extended Main Sequence Turnoffs

 - **Abstract**
 Precision UBVRI photometry of NGC 7789 is combined with Gaia data to map reddening variations across the cluster face. HYDRA spectra, Gaia astrometry, and isochrone fitting constrain the absolute reddening, apparent modulus, and age to E(B-V) = 0.30 +/- 0.02, (m-M)=12.51 +/- 0.06, and 1.46 +/- 0.02 Gyr for [Fe/H] between -0.2 and solar; the spectroscopic [Fe/H] = -0.13 +/- 0.068 (MAD) from 156 single-star members. Corrections for variable reddening reduce the scatter in the unevolved main sequence below the turnoff. A(Li) is derived for only single star members from the G-dwarf Li-Plateau to the tip of the red giant branch. Giants separate into two distinct groups, probable first-ascent giants with detectable Li that declines with evolution toward the red giant tip and stars within the clump and the asymptotic giant branch which only exhibit upper limits. A(Li) structure from the turnoff to the unevolved main sequence, including the Li-Dip, and the presence of an extended color spread among the upper main sequence stars are attributed to the V_ROT distribution, indicating the wall of the Li-Dip as the true hot boundary of the Kraft break. Differences in the color-magnitude diagram topology of NGC 7789 and NGC 752 are explored and attributed to differences in the individual cluster V_ROT distributions. Prior indications that main sequence stars more massive than the Li-Dip evolve redward across the Li-Wall, undergoing rotational spindown and Li depletion like stars within the Li-Dip, are confirmed.

 - **Abstract**
 The Chandra X-ray Observatory is a mainstay of modern observational astrophysics. With the highest angular resolution of any X-ray facility, its imaging and spectral capabilities in the 0.5-10 keV band have led to both unique and complementary breakthroughs in nearly all areas of the field. Now more than a quarter century into its mission, Chandra continues to provide unique information on the contributions of compact objects to the evolution of galaxies, the nature of supernova explosions, the impact of energetic jets from supermassive black holes on their host environments, and the fate of exoplanet atmospheres in systems rich with stellar flares. Here we provide a summary of Chandra results - one that is embarrassingly incomplete, but representative of both the exquisite past and promising future for Chandra's contributions to high energy astrophysics and all of mainstream astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar abundances of elements with production channels that are metallicity-dependent (most notably aluminium) have provided an empirical route for separating different Galactic components. We present 'single-zone' analytic solutions for the chemical evolution of galaxies when the stellar yields are metallicity-dependent. Our solutions assume a constant star formation efficiency, a constant mass-loading factor and that the yields are linearly dependent on the interstellar medium abundance (with the option of a saturation of the yields at high metallicity). We demonstrate how the metallicity dependence of the yields can be mathematically considered as a system-dependent delay time (approximately equal to the system's depletion time) that, when combined with system-independent delay times arising from stellar evolutionary channels, produces the separation of different systems based on their star formation efficiency and mass-loading factor. The utility of the models is highlighted through comparisons with data from the APOGEE spectroscopic survey. We provide a comprehensive discussion of the chemical evolution models in the [Al/Fe]-[Mg/Fe] plane, a diagnostic plane for the separation of in-situ and accreted Galactic components. Extensions of the models are presented, allowing for the modelling of more complex behaviours largely through the linear combination of the presented simpler solutions.

 Context. The polarized thermal emission from interstellar dust offers a valuable tool for probing both the dust and the magnetic field in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, existing observations only yield the total amount of dust emission along the line of sight (LoS), with no information on its LoS distribution. Aims. We present a new method designed to give access to the LoS distribution of the dust emission, both in terms of intensity and polarization. Methods. We relied on three kinematic gas tracers (HI, 12CO, and 13CO emission lines) to identify the different clouds present along the LoS. We decomposed the measured intensity of the dust emission, $I_d$, into separate contributions from these clouds. We performed a similar decomposition of the measured Stokes parameters for linear polarization, $Q_d$ and $U_d$, to derive the polarization parameters of the different clouds, and from this we inferred the clouds' magnetic field orientations. Results. We applied our method to a $3~{\rm deg}^2$ region of the sky, centered on $(l,b) = (139°30',-3°16')$ and exhibiting signs of star formation activity. We found this region to be dominated by an extended and bright cloud with nearly horizontal magnetic field, as expected from the nearly vertical polarization angles measured by Planck. More importantly, we detected the presence of two smaller, depolarizing molecular clouds with very different magnetic field orientations in the plane of the sky ($\simeq 65°$ and $\simeq 45°$ from the horizontal). This is a novel and viable result, which cannot be directly read off the Planck polarization maps. Conclusions. The application of our method to the G139 region convincingly demonstrates the need to complement 2D polarization maps with 3D kinematic information when looking for reliable estimates of magnetic field orientations.
#### On the Universality of the Relation Between Magnetic Fields and Star Formation in Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium (ISM) is permeated by magnetic fields that affect gas dynamics and star formation. These fields correlate with supernova (SN)-driven turbulence, but whether the scaling is universal across galaxy properties, ISM phases, and energy budgets remains unclear. We quantify the dependence of magnetic fields on star formation activity including both regular and starburst galaxies. We analyse 19 spiral disks from the cosmological RTnsCRiMHD Azahar suite, deriving line-of-sight integrated maps to measure median magnetic-field strength ($B$), specific energies (thermal, turbulent, magnetic, and cosmic-ray), and star formation rate (SFR), star formation surface density ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$) and specific SFR (sSFR). We find an almost universal magnetic-field-SFR scaling with slope $\alpha \approx 0.2$-$0.3$ across galaxy mass and ISM phases. The $B$-$\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ slope ($\alpha \approx 1/3$) supports an SN-driven, turbulence-regulated origin. Neutral gas is generally turbulence-dominated and in near equipartition with magnetic energy for systems with sSFR $\gtrsim 0.1$ Gyr$^{-1}$ and SFR $\gtrsim 1$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The simulated trends match observations with similar slopes ($\alpha \approx 0.25$-$0.35$), indicating that SN-driven turbulence is the main amplification mechanism behind the near-universal $B$-SFR relation.
#### Lyman-$α$ radiation pressure regulates star formation efficiency

 - **Abstract**
 Order-unity star formation efficiencies (SFE) in early galaxies may explain the overabundance of bright galaxies observed by JWST at high redshift. Here we show that Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) radiation pressure limits the gas mass converted into stars, particularly in primordial environments. We develop a shell model including Ly$\alpha$ feedback, and validate it with one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. To account for Ly$\alpha$ resonant scattering, we adopt the most recent force multiplier fits, including the effect of Ly$\alpha$ photon destruction by dust grains. We find that, independently of their gas surface density $\Sigma_g$, clouds are disrupted on a timescale shorter than a free-fall time, and even before supernova explosions if $\Sigma_g \gtrsim 10^3\,M_{\odot}\ \rm pc^{-2}$. At $\log(Z/Z_{\odot}) = -2$, relevant for high-redshift galaxies, the SFE is $0.01 \lesssim \hat{\epsilon}_{*} \lesssim 0.66$ for $10^3 \lesssim\Sigma_g [M_{\odot}\ \rm pc^{-2}] \lesssim 10^5$. The SFE is even lower for decreasing metallicity. Near-unity SFEs are possible only for extreme surface densities, $\Sigma_{g} \gtrsim 10^5\;M_{\odot}\ \rm pc^{-2}$, and near-solar metallicities. We conclude that Ly$\alpha$ radiation pressure severely limits a possible extremely efficient, feedback-free phase of star formation in dense, metal-poor clouds.
#### Accretion rates of stellar-mass compact objects embedded in AGN discs

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass compact objects (COs) embedded in active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs are commonly assumed to accrete via Bondi or Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) prescriptions, neglecting gas angular momentum. We show that differential rotation in AGN discs can impart non-negligible angular momentum, in which case accretion proceeds through a viscous disc rather than Bondi/BHL flow. Our model provides a new framework estimating the CO accretion rate as $\dot{M}_\mathrm{CO} = \min\{\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis}, \dot{M}_\mathrm{BHL}\}$, where the viscous rate $\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis}$ accounts for gas--CO relative motion decomposed into a local gradient term (due to differential rotation) and bulk motion (from differing orbital parameters). This rate can be expressed as $\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis} = \alpha \xi (r_\mathrm{H}/r_\mathrm{BHL})^3\dot{M}_\mathrm{BHL}$, where $\xi$ is a coefficient of order unity. It can also be approximately scaled to the global AGN accretion rate as $\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis} \propto \dot{M}_1$, with the scaling coefficients in both forms determined by the specific dynamical configuration. The accretion is viscosity-limited when $q > [\alpha \xi(1+\mathcal{M}^2)^{3}/3]^{1/2} h^3$, where $q$ is the mass ratio between the CO and the supermassive black hole, $\alpha$ the viscosity parameter, $\mathcal{M}$ the Mach number of the bulk relative motion, and $h$ the aspect ratio of the AGN disc. In thin AGN discs this condition is satisfied for most stellar-mass or more massive COs. Our framework also naturally allows for the inclusion of established outflow corrections, thereby enabling a more realistic treatment of super-Eddington flows. Our formulation thus improves upon Bondi/BHL prescriptions and offers a more physically motivated basis for studying CO evolution in AGN environments.
#### Direct Numerical Simulations of Oxygen-Flame-Driven Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition in Type Ia Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We present direct numerical simulations demonstrating deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) driven by oxygen flames in Type Ia supernova progenitors. Using the Castro hydrodynamics code coupled with the ``aprox13'' 13-isotope nuclear network, we simulate combustion in isolated fuel regions where oxygen flames trail carbon flames. In a fiducial one-dimensional run at $\rho_{0}=3.5\times10^{7}\ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$ we observe spontaneous DDT of the oxygen flame via the Zel'dovich gradient mechanism when the carbon-oxygen separation reaches $\sim 10\ \mathrm{km}$. The oxygen detonation then captures the carbon flame and triggers a stable carbon detonation. Systematic one-dimensional parameter scans show that successful carbon DDT requires upstream densities in the range $(3.1$--$3.6)\times10^{7}\ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$ and a minimum carbon-flame thickness of $\gtrsim 20\ \mathrm{m}$. Two-dimensional simulations confirm DDT and demonstrate that the multidimensional cellular structure of the oxygen detonation can promote carbon detonation at somewhat lower densities than in one dimension. These results provide direct numerical evidence that oxygen-flame-driven DDT is physically plausible in turbulent white-dwarf environments and underscore the importance of multidimensional effects for Type Ia supernova explosion modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 During massive star formation, dense gas undergoes chemical evolution, producing both simple and complex organic molecules (COMs) characteristic of hot molecular cores. How this evolution depends on protostellar physical properties remains unclear. We investigate the chemical content of 22 well-studied massive protostars from the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation survey, aiming to identify correlations between chemical and physical parameters. We analyzed Atacama Compact Array and Total Power 1.3 mm (Band 6) data, deriving column densities, line widths, and excitation temperatures of multiple molecular species by modeling detected lines under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) using MADCUBA. Spectra show 35 species, from simple molecules (e.g., CO, SO, SiO) to complex organic molecules (COMs), with seven sources exhibiting high chemical complexity (> 100 transitions). Average excitation temperatures vary across the sample: $T_\text{ex}>100~\text{K}$ for eight sources, $50-100~\text{K}$ for four, and $T_\text{ex} < 50~\text{K}$ for the remainder. Sources with $T_\text{ex} < 50~\text{K}$ trace lukewarm, chemically simple gas, while those with $T_\text{ex}>100~\text{K}$ indicate the presence of typical hot cores where thermal desorption is efficient, resulting in line-rich spectra. Comparing these chemical properties with the bolometric luminosity to envelope mass ratio ($L_\text{bol}/M_\text{env}$), an evolutionary tracer, we find tentative correlations with line widths, excitation temperature, and column densities. These data provide important constraints for chemodynamical models of massive protostellar cores.

 - **Abstract**
 The interplay between the accretion of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the stellar mass growth of the host galaxies is still a matter of hot debate. The accretion of the SMBHs is expected to release energy under the form of AGNs. This energy is believed to impact the star formation activity and contribute to the quenching of galaxies. Here, we address this key unsolved issue with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE. In DECODE, we grow galaxies with their SFR linked to halo accretion rate distributions via abundance matching. SMBHs are evolved following the stellar mass growth of their host galaxies by assigning an accretion rate at each redshift from the empirical Eddington ratio distributions and duty cycles. We test the assumption that galaxies permanently quench when their central SMBHs approach the limit imposed by the observed $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_\star$ relation, as a proxy of SMBH disruptive feedback. We find that simply imposing the $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_\star$ condition is sufficient to generate a fraction of quenched galaxies consistent with current data, including the newest ones from Euclid. In addition, our minimal, data-driven model, also predicts SMBH scaling relations consistent in slope and normalisation with those observed, and an $M_{\rm BH} - M_\star$ relation weakly evolving with redshift. The model also naturally generates SMBH accretion rates peaking within 1 Gyr of their host SFHs. We note that all the main predictions on galaxy quenched fractions and SMBH growth histories and scaling relations are degenerate with those expected in a halo quenching model. The comprehensive data-driven model presented in this work represents an invaluable tool to investigate SMBH demography across time and environments in an accurate, physically motivated manner, ideally suited to rapidly explore the implications from large surveys, such as Euclid and Rubin-LSST.
#### Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: Evidence for Galactic Cosmic Ray Processing

 - **Abstract**
 Spectral observations of 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) with JWST/NIRSpec and SPHEREx reveal an extreme CO2 enrichment (CO2/H2O = 7.6+-0.3) that is 4.5 sigma above solar system comet trends and among the highest ever recorded. This unprecedented composition, combined with substantial absolute CO levels (CO/H2O = 1.65+-0.09) and red spectral slopes, provides direct evidence for galactic cosmic ray (GCR) processing of the outer layers of the interstellar comet nucleus. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that GCR irradiation efficiently converts CO to CO2 while synthesizing organic-rich crusts, suggesting that the outer layers of 3I/ATLAS consist of irradiated material which properties are consistent with the observed composition of 3I/ATLAS coma and with its observed spectral reddening. Estimates of the erosion rate of 3I/ATLAS indicate that current outgassing samples the GCR-processed zone only (depth ~15-20 m), never reaching pristine interior material. Outgassing of pristine material after perihelion remains possible, though it is considered unlikely. This represents a paradigm shift: long-residence interstellar objects primarily reveal GCR-processed material rather than pristine material representative of their primordial formation environments. With 3I/ATLAS approaching perihelion in October 2025, immediate follow-up observations are critical to confirm this interpretation and establish GCR processing as a fundamental evolutionary pathway for interstellar objects.

 We present combined JWST NIRSpec and MIRI/MRS integral field spectroscopy data of the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of the highly dust obscured Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7582, which is part of the sample of AGN in the Galaxy Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS). Spatially resolved analysis of the pure rotational H$_2$ lines (S(1)-S(7)) reveals a characteristic power-law temperature distribution in different apertures, with the two prominent southern star-forming regions exhibiting unexpectedly high molecular gas temperatures, comparable to those in the AGN powered nuclear region. We investigate potential heating mechanisms including direct AGN photoionisation, UV fluorescent excitation from young star clusters, and shock excitation. We find that shock heating gives the most plausible explanation, consistent with multiple near- and mid-IR tracers and diagnostics. Using photoionisation models from the PhotoDissociation Region Toolbox, we quantify the ISM conditions in the different regions, determining that the southern star-forming regions have a high density ($n_H \sim 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) and are irradiated by a moderate UV radiation field ($G_0 \sim 10^{3}$ Habing). Fitting a suite of Paris-Durham shock models to the rotational H$_2$ lines, as well as rovibrational 1-0 S(1), 1-0 S(2), and 2-1 S(1) H$_2$ emission lines, we find that a slow ($v_s \sim 10$ km/s) C-type shock is likely responsible for the elevated temperatures. Our analysis loosely favours local starburst activity as the driver of the shocks and circumnuclear gas dynamics in NGC 7582, though the possibility of an AGN jet contribution cannot be excluded.

 - **Abstract**
 An understanding of the assembly history of the complex star cluster Omega Centauri has long been sought after, with many studies separating the stars on the color-magnitude diagram into multiple groupings across small magnitude ranges. Utilizing the oMEGACat combined astro-photometric and spectroscopic dataset we parse 14 subpopulations from the upper red-giant branch to below the main-sequence turnoff. We combine our results with previous works to estimate the age and age spread of each population. We find that the chemically enhanced (P2) populations are all ~1 Gyr younger (~11.6 Gyr old) and have significantly higher intrinsic age spreads (0.6 Gyr) than the primordial (P1) populations (~12.6 Gyr old, 0.3 Gyr spread), with the intermediate (Im) populations falling in between the two. Additionally, we connect for the first time the Chromosome Diagram to the two-stream age-metallicity relation, allowing us to link the P1 and P2 stars to the distinct star formation tracks, proposed to be in-situ and ex-situ contributions to the cluster's assembly. Our results are consistent with some suggested formation models and rule out others but no current model can explain all observed features of the subpopulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Neon (Ne) is the fifth most abundant element in the Universe. Because it is chemically inert, it has never been considered in astrochemical models that studied molecular evolution. In the cold dark environments of pre-stellar cores, where the temperatures are below 10 K, Ne can condense onto the surface of interstellar grains. We investigated the effect of Ne on the production of formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and methanol (CH$_3$OH) through carbon monoxide (CO) hydrogenation on different cold surfaces. We highlight its role in conditions corresponding to pre-stellar cores. In an ultra-high vacuum system, we conducted two types of experiments. The first experiment involved the co-deposition of CO and H atoms with or without Ne. The second experiment involved depositing a monolayer of CO and separately a monolayer of Ne (or vice versa), followed by bombarding the layers with hydrogen atoms. Additionally, we used a gas-grain chemical code to simulate a pre-stellar core and determine where Ne can affect the chemistry. The presence of Ne on the surface significantly inhibits CO hydrogenation at temperatures below 12 K. In the co-deposition experiments, we observed a 38% decrease in the H$_2$CO production at 11 K when the quantity of Ne in the mixture was lower than a monolayer. At 10 K and with one monolayer in the mixture, the production decreased to 77%, and it reached 91% for a few monolayers of Ne in the mixture at 9 K. While the decrease in CH$_3$OH formation is still notable, it is less pronounced: 43% at 11 K, 61% at 10 K, and 77% at 9 K. Experiments with stacked layers revealed that the CO layer decay varies slightly when the Ne layer is positioned above or below it. This observation indicates that Ne and CO create a mixture in which Ne can diffuse and stabilize at the surface, which isolates CO molecules from the accreting H atoms.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from CROCODILE-DWARF, a suite of cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations of isolated field dwarf galaxies with halo masses of $\sim10^{10}\,M_\odot$ at $z=0$, performed with the \textsc{gadget4-osaka} code. The simulations include detailed modeling of star formation, chemical enrichment, and supernova feedback using the \textsc{CELib} and \textsc{grackle} libraries, achieving baryonic resolutions of $\sim2\times10^3\,M_\odot$. Our study focuses on how assembly history governs the structural and kinematic diversity of dwarf galaxies within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. The simulated galaxies reproduce the observed stellar-to-halo mass, mass--metallicity, and size--mass relations, yielding stellar masses of $10^6-10^8\,M_\odot$ and metallicities consistent with those of Local Group dwarf galaxies. The galaxies display a broad range of rotational support, where gas is generally more rotationally supported than stars. Differences in morphology and kinematics primarily reflect variations in halo assembly timescales and merger activity. Early-assembling, high-concentration halos form stars efficiently and become gas-poor by $z=0$, while late-assembling, low-concentration halos remain gas-rich due to delayed star formation and rejuvenated gas accretion. We identify a clear anti-correlation between rotational support and the cumulative merger mass fraction, demonstrating that dynamical heating by mergers is the dominant factor shaping kinematic diversity. In some cases, late-time mergers induce the formation of extended gas disks by delivering fresh gas and angular momentum. These results demonstrate that assembly history, rather than halo mass alone, critically shapes the present-day kinematic and morphological diversity of dwarf galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerous observations have shown that the dark matter halo surface density, defined as the product of core radius and halo central density of cored dark matter haloes is nearly constant and independent of galaxy mass over a whole slew of galaxy types. Here we calculate the surface density in cold dark matter(CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models including baryons, as well as SIDM without baryons, for dwarf galaxies of masses $\approx 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ using mock catalogs obtained from simulations as part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments project. We find that the dark matter surface density and column density are nearly constant for CDM and SIDM for this mass range. The halo surface density obtained from the Burkert profile fit is consistent with galactic-scale observations within $1\sigma$. We also computed the empirical scaling relations between the central surface density and maximum velocity using the best-fit dark matter profiles, and found that they agree with observations of Milky Way and M31 dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study we investigate the chemical enrichment of the rapid neutron-capture process in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We measure [Eu/Fe] abundance ratios in 209 giant stars that are confirmed members of the SMC, providing the first extensive dataset of Eu abundances in this galaxy across its full metallicity range, spanning more than 1.5 dex. We compare Eu abundances with those of Mg and Ba to evaluate the efficiency of the r-process relative to $\alpha$-capture and s-process nucleosynthesis. The SMC shows enhanced [Eu/Fe] values at all metallicities (comparable with the values measured in the Milky Way), with a clear decline as [Fe/H] increases (from $\sim$ -1.75 dex to $\sim$ -0.5 dex), consistent with the onset of Type Ia supernovae. In contrast, [Eu/Mg] is enhanced by about +0.5 dex at all [Fe/H], significantly above the values observed in Milky Way stars, where [Eu/Mg] remains close to solar, reflecting comparable production of r-process and $\alpha$-capture elements. Moreover, [Ba/Eu] increases with metallicity, beginning at [Fe/H] $\approx$ -1.5 dex, namely at a lower metallicity with respect to the Milky Way, where [Ba/Eu] starts to increase around [Fe/H] $\approx$ -1 dex. Our findings suggest the SMC has a higher production of Eu (with respect to the $\alpha$-elements) than the Milky Way but in line with what observed in other dwarf systems within the Local Group. We confirm that galaxies with star formation efficiencies lower than the Milky Way have high [Eu/$\alpha$], probably indicating a stronger efficiency of the delayed sources of r-process at low metallicities.
#### Active Dwarf Galaxy Database II: Connections between Host Galaxy Properties and Black Hole Accretion Signatures

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the connection between accretion signatures and host galaxy properties in the context of how active dwarf galaxies are identified. We use the database constructed in Wasleske & Baldassare (2024) which contains dwarf galaxies that were selected as active galaxies by optical spectroscopy, infrared colors, X-ray brightness, and photometric variability. Multi-wavelength archival data was used to consistently apply all of these methods to every galaxy within this compiled set. The cross application of these methods resulted in a diversity of sub-populations identified as active by some set of these techniques. In this paper, we estimate host galaxy properties from spectral energy distribution models. We connect the active galactic nuclei (AGN) signatures to our estimated host galaxies' properties using statistical dimensionality reduction methods. We find that dwarf AGN selected by infrared colors are the most distinct population, with the highest star formation rates and lowest stellar masses. We also find some other key population differences, such as the broad line AGN having significantly higher AGN luminosities. X-ray and variability selected AGN have higher average star formation rates than those selected with optical narrow line spectroscopic diagrams. Our connections to the host galaxy parameters potentially point to the sub-populations representing different epochs of the evolution of accretion.
#### The Weighing Halos Accurately, Locally, and Efficiently with Supernovae (WHALES) Survey Overview and Initial Data Release

 - **Abstract**
 We present an overview of the Weighing Halos Accurately, Locally, and Efficiently with Supernovae (WHALES) survey, the first to discover and measure Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in and around galaxy superclusters. By building a sample of SNe~Ia around these massive environments, we aim to provide new constraints on bulk-flow models while laying the groundwork for improved estimates of supercluster masses. Here, we present data from the first two seasons targeting the Shapley Supercluster (0.02<z<0.06), which is responsible for a large but unknown fraction of our local group's motion. Until now, no supernovae had been analyzed in the direction of Shapley. Through the WHALES survey, we have identified 12 likely SNe Ia in this region using SkyMapper, including 8 with spectroscopic confirmation. We present the first light curves of these SNe and combine our observations with data from ATLAS. We demonstrate that the low number of discovered SNe Ia per season is consistent with various rate calculations, highlighting the need for future surveys to monitor superclusters over a multi-year timespan. Finally, we present simulations of SN Ia observations in the environments of massive galaxy clusters, demonstrating how the inferred peculiar velocities can constrain cluster masses, and highlighting the added complexity within superclusters. We find that a sample of 100 SNe Ia would enable a 25% precision measurement of the total mass of the Shapley Supercluster.
#### Boosting the cosmic 21-cm signal with exotic Lyman-$α$ from dark matter

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm signal from the epoch of cosmic dawn ($z \sim 10-30$) offers a powerful probe of new physics. One standard mechanism for constraining decaying dark matter from 21-cm observations relies on heating of the intergalactic medium by the decay products, an effect whose observability is entangled with the uncertain Lyman-$\alpha$ fluxes and X-ray heating from the first stars. In this Letter, we explore a novel mechanism, where the Lyman-$\alpha$ photons produced from dark matter decay initiate early Wouthuysen-Field coupling of the spin temperature to the gas temperature, thereby boosting the 21-cm signal. This mechanism provides constraints on dark matter that are less dependent on uncertainties associated with star formation than constraints on exotic heating. We study this effect for decaying dark matter with masses $m_{\chi}\sim20.4-27.2$ eV, where diphoton decay efficiently produces Lyman-series photons. We present forecasts for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and the Square Kilometre Array, showing their potential to probe an unconstrained parameter space for light decaying DM, including axion-like particles.
