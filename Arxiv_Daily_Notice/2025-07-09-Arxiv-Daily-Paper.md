#### Explaining ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at $3 < z < 5$ in the context of their environments

 - **Abstract**
 The swift assembly of the earliest galaxies poses a significant challenge to our understanding of galaxy formation. Ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at intermediate redshifts ($3 < z < 5$) currently present one of the most pressing problems for theoretical modeling, since very few mechanisms can be invoked to explain how such galaxies formed so early in the history of the Universe. Here, we exploit the fact that these galaxies all reside within significant overdensities to explain their masses. To this end, we construct and release a modified version of the Extreme Value Statistics (EVS) code which takes into account galaxy environment by incorporating clustering in the calculation. With this new version of EVS, we find that ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at $3<z<5$ do not present as serious a tension with simple models of galaxy formation when the analysis of a given galaxy is conditioned on its environment.

 - **Abstract**
 The nuclear transient eRASSt J012026.5-292727 (J012026 hereafter) was discovered in the second SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS2). The source appeared more than one order of magnitude brighter than the eRASS1 upper limits (peak eRASS2 0.2-2.3 keV flux of 1.14 x 10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1), and with a soft X-ray spectrum (photon index Gamma = 4.3). Over the following months, the X-ray flux started decaying, with significant flaring activity on both hour- and year-timescales. By inspecting the multiwavelength light curves of time-domain wide-field facilities, we detected a strong mid-infrared flare, evolving over 2 years, and a weaker optical counterpart. Follow-up optical spectroscopy revealed transient features, including redshifted Balmer lines (FWHM ~1500 km/s), strong Fe II emission, He II and Bowen lines, and high-ionization iron coronal lines. One spectrum showed a triple-peaked H-beta line, consistent with emission from a face-on elliptical disk. The spectroscopic features and the slow evolution of the event place J012026 within the classifications of Bowen fluorescence flares (BFFs) and extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs). BFFs have been associated with rejuvenated accreting SMBHs, although the mechanism triggering the onset of the new accretion flow is still unclear, while ECLEs have been linked to the disruption of stars in gas-rich environments. The association of J012026 to both classes, combined with the multi-wavelength information, suggests that BFFs could be, at least in some cases, due to tidal disruption events (TDEs). The observed X-ray variability, uncommon in standard TDEs, adds complexity to these families of nuclear transients. These results highlight the diverse phenomenology of nuclear accretion events and demonstrate the value of systematic X-ray surveys, such as eROSITA and Einstein Probe, for uncovering such transients and characterizing their physical origin.

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to play a central role in quenching star formation by removing or destroying molecular gas from host galaxies via radiation-pressure driven outflows and/or radio jets. Some studies of cold molecular gas in galaxies at Cosmic Noon ($z\sim2$) show that AGN have less cold gas ($<$100 K) compared to mass-matched star-forming galaxies. However, cold gas could also be shock-heated to warmer phases, detectable via H$_{2}$ transitions in the rest-frame near- and mid-infrared spectra. The Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) of the Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) aboard JWST has opened a unique window to observe these emission lines in galaxies at Cosmic Noon. We present the first detection of hot molecular gas in cid_346, an X-ray AGN at $z\sim2.2$, via the H$_{2}$ ro-vibrational transition at 2.12 $\mu$m. We measure a hot molecular gas mass of $\sim 8.0 \times 10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$, which is $\sim 10^{5}-10^{6}$ times lower than the cold molecular gas mass. cid_346 is located in an environment with extended gas structures and satellite galaxies. This is supported by detection of hot and cold molecular gas out to distances $>$10 kpc in MIRI/MRS and ALMA data, respectively and ancillary NIRCam imaging that reveals two satellite galaxies at distances of $\sim$0.4 arcsec (3.3 kpc) and $\sim$0.9 arcsec (7.4 kpc) from the AGN. Our results tentatively indicate that while the CO(3-2)-based cold gas phase dominates the molecular gas mass at Cosmic Noon, H$_{2}$ ro-vibrational transitions are effective in tracing hot molecular gas locally in regions that may lack CO emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Ionized proximity zones around luminous quasars provide a unique laboratory to characterize the Ly$\alpha$ emission lines from $z>6$ galaxies without significant attenuation from the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, Ly$\alpha$ line measurements for galaxies within high-redshift quasars' proximity zones have been rare so far. Here we present deep spectroscopic observations obtained with the NIRSpec/MSA instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of galaxies in two $z>6$ quasar fields. We measure the Ly$\alpha$ line fluxes for 50 galaxies at $6<z<7$ with UV absolute magnitude $M_\text{UV}<-19$ (median $M_\text{UV}=-19.97$), among which 15 are located near the luminous quasars, i.e. within $\Delta v<2500\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$. We find that galaxies near the quasars show significant flux bluewards of the systemic Ly$\alpha$ wavelength, and have higher Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width compared to galaxies at similar redshifts that are not located within the quasars' environment. Our result indicates little or no redshift evolution for the Ly$\alpha$-emitter fraction from $z\sim6.4$ to $z\sim5$. Leveraging the low IGM opacity in the quasars' vicinity, we evaluate the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction ($f_\text{esc}^{\text{Ly}\alpha}$) of high-redshift galaxies. Our analysis suggests that galaxies at $\langle z\rangle\approx6.4$ have an average $f_\text{esc}^{\text{Ly}\alpha}=0.14\pm0.04$. This value is consistent with reionization models where the Lyman continuum escape fraction is low $(f_\text{esc}^\text{LyC}\lesssim0.1)$ for luminous galaxies, and where the most luminous galaxies have only a minor contribution to the total ionizing photon budget.

 - **Abstract**
 The strongly-lensed $z\sim 6$ Sunrise galaxy offers an incredible opportunity to investigate star formation in the early universe on parsec or smaller scales. The highly magnified object Earendel within the Sunrise was previously identified as a candidate star or binary due to size constraints placed by the lensing magnification, however recent works have suggested this constraint may be relaxed to even the size of star clusters. Here, we explore the hypothesis that Earendel may actually be a star cluster, and simultaneously evaluate other star clusters within the host galaxy. Leveraging deep, archival James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy, we determine a spectroscopic redshift for the Sunrise galaxy $z=5.926 \pm 0.013$, and we fit simple stellar population (SSP) models from three premier libraries to evaluate the physical parameters of Earendel and another distinct star cluster in the Sunrise dubbed `$1b$'. We find the rest-UV through optical continuum of Earendel to be well-described by an SSP, nearly equivalently to $1b$ which is confidently a star cluster. We infer they have intermediate ages $t_{\rm age}\sim 30$--$150\,$Myr, are metal poor ($Z_\star\lesssim10\%\,Z_\odot$), and are consistent with the formation age-metallicity trend seen in local globular clusters. Such intermediate age clusters are seldom probed spectroscopically in the high redshift universe, and we explore the extent to which these clusters can be characterized via the spectroscopic continuum.

 - **Abstract**
 We prove that the spin-aligned electromagnetic recoil force acting on a pulsar vanishes identically in Force-Free Electrodynamics. This contrasts with Hirai et al.'s recent argument that the rocket effect was important for explaining the eccentricity distribution of wide neutron star binaries found by Gaia. Our detailed analysis confirms that for a broad range of initial conditions and natal kick distributions, the rocket velocities of $v_r \gtrsim 30\, \mathrm{km/s}$ are required to account for the observed eccentricities. However, we find that in scenarios where the common envelope phase does not significantly shrink the initial orbit, and the natal kicks are drawn from Paczynski-type distribution, these eccentricities may arise without the influence of an EM rocket. If the natal kicks are perpendicular to the initial orbits, then explaining the Gaia neutron star eccentricities without invoking rockets additionally requires that the pre-supernova binaries avoid significant circularization, and that the mass loss during the supernova is minimal. The rocket effect can only be substantial in "weak" pulsars, where pair production near the light cylinder is suppressed and ${\bf E}\cdot{\bf B} \neq 0$ in the outer magnetosphere. We derive a rough estimate for a rocket force in a weak pulsar and relate it to the pulsar's radiative efficiency; simulations are needed to obtain numerically reliable expressions. If future observations prove that rockets are required to explain the data, this would imply that Gaia neutron stars are $\gtrsim $ Myr old, were previously rapidly spinning and are weakly magnetized, with a dipole field $\lesssim 10^{10}$ G and a relatively strong quadrupole component.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of the stellar populations and kinematics of the globular cluster (GC) rich ultra-diffuse galaxy, PUDG-R21, using spectroscopic observations obtained with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). The recessional velocity is measured to be 5536$\pm$10 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$, confirming its association with the Perseus cluster. The galaxy exhibits mild rotation of 15.6$\pm$10 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$ and a stellar velocity dispersion of 19.4$\pm$3.5 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$ within the galaxy effective radius. From this, we infer a dynamical mass of M$_{\mathrm{dyn}}=9.3\pm3.3\times10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$. Based on a halo mass derived from PUDG-R21 GC counts, we find our dynamical mass is consistent with a cored dark matter profile. The integrated stellar population analysis reveals a predominantly old stellar population of 10.4$\pm$1.2 Gyr, with intermediate-low metallicity ([M/H]=-0.64$\pm$0.12 dex) and elevated alpha abundances ([Mg/Fe]=0.38$\pm$0.25 dex). The inferred star formation history suggests rapid stellar assembly, likely truncating prior to or during the galaxy's infall into the cluster at an early epoch ($\sim$10 Gyr ago). The analysis of stellar population gradients (age and metallicity) indicates a flat profile out to one effective radius. Here, we consider the involvement of two star formation events, initially forming a large population of metal-poor globular clusters, and then the latter contributing to the more metal-enriched diffuse stellar body. The evidence of subsequent star formation suggests this galaxy is more like an extension of the classical dwarf population than the much discussed failed galaxy UDGs.
#### Numerical Validation of the Yarkovsky Effect in Super-Fast Rotating Asteroids

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries show that asteroids spinning in less than a few minutes undergo sizeable semi-major-axis drifts, possibly driven by the Yarkovsky effect. Analytical formulas can match these drifts only if very low thermal inertia is assumed, implying a dust-fine regolith or a highly porous interior that is difficult to retain under such extreme centrifugal forces. With analytical theories of the Yarkovsky effect resting on a set of assumptions, their applicability to cases of super-fast rotation should be verified. We aim to evaluate the validity of the analytical models in such scenarios and to determine whether the Yarkovsky effect can explain the observed drift in rapidly rotating asteroids. We have developed a numerical model of the Yarkovsky effect tailored to super-fast rotators. The code resolves micrometre-scale thermal waves on millisecond time steps, capturing the steep gradients that arise when surface thermal inertia is extremely low. A new 3-D heat-conduction and photon-recoil solver is benchmarked against the THERMOBS thermophysical code and the analytical solution of the Yarkovsky effect, over a range of rotation periods and thermal conductivities. The analytical Yarkovsky drift agrees well with the numerical solver. For thermal conductivities from $0.0001$ to $1$ $\mathrm{Wm^{-1}K^{-1}}$ and spin periods as short as 10 s, the two solutions differ by no more than $15\%$. Applied to the 34-s rapid rotator 2016 GE1, the best match of the measured drift is obtained with $\Gamma\lesssim20$ $\mathrm{Jm^{-2}K^{-1}s^{-1/2}}$, a value that implies $\sim100$ K temperature swings each spin cycle. This confirms that the observed semi-major axis drifts for super-fast rotators can be explained by the Yarkovsky effect and very low thermal inertia, which might point to rapid thermal fatigue as a regolith-generation mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the amount of sulfur in volatiles and refractories in the ISM remains one of the main problems in astrochemistry. The detection of H$_2$S ices, which are thought to be one of the main sulfur reservoirs, has not been achieved yet, and the only S-bearing species detected in the ices to date is OCS. PRODIGE large survey observations with NOEMA of several Class 0/I protostars in the Perseus Molecular Cloud provide a perfect opportunity to study the H$_2$S and OCS composition of the ices through the volatiles sublimated in the warm inner core (T$>$100K, n $\sim10^6$cm$^{-3}$) of these protostars. Our aim is to determine the H$_2$S/OCS ratio in the warm inner core of 24 protostars in order to study how it is affected by different factors during its evolution. We used the NOEMA millimeter observations from the PRODIGE program of H$_2$S, H$_2^{33}$S, OCS, OC$^{33}$S and OC$^{34}$S to estimate the H$_2$S and OCS column densities in the warm inner cores. We used SO and SO$_2$ data from the ALMA archive to give a rough estimate of the total sulfur abundance. We explore the chemistry of H$_2$S and OCS in the warm cores using chemical and dynamical simulations of the collapse of a dense core to form a protostar. The estimated H$_2$S/OCS ratio reveals a segregation of the sources into ``OCS-poor'' and ``OCS-rich'' protostars, where the OCS-poor protostars present higher H$_2$S/OCS ratios than the OCS-rich ones. Total sulfur abundance is always dominated by either H$_2$S or OCS, grows with evolution during the Class 0 phase up to $D_S<8$, and decreases again in the Class I. Simulations show that temperature changes in the pre-stellar phase and during the collapse can produce substantial differences in the H$_2$S and OCS abundances and in the H$_2$S/OCS ratio. Our analysis shows that the H$_2$S/OCS ratio is strongly influenced by the environment and the initial conditions of the cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Photodissociation regions (PDRs) exhibit emission between 3-20 um known as the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs), originating from small carbonaceous species such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The AIB spectra observed in Galactic PDRs, such as the Orion Bar observations by the PDRs4All JWST program, are considered a local analog for those seen in extragalactic star-forming regions. We present the Python version of PAHFIT, a spectral decomposition tool that separates the contributions by AIB subcomponents, thermal dust emission, gas lines, stellar light, and dust extinction. By fitting segments of the Orion Bar spectra, we provide a configuration to decompose JWST spectra of PDRs in detail. The resulting central wavelengths and FWHM of the AIB subcomponents are compiled into a "PDR pack" for PAHFIT. We applied PAHFIT with this PDR pack and the default continuum model to spectra of the central star forming ring of the galaxy NGC7469. We introduce an alternate dust continuum model to fit the Orion Bar spectra, as the default PAHFIT continuum model mismatches the intensity at 15-26 um. PAHFIT fits with the PDR pack and the alternate continuum model reproduce the Orion Bar spectra with residuals of a few percent, and similar performance is achieved for the NGC7469 spectra. We provide PAHFIT-based diagnostics that trace the profile variations of the 3.3, 3.4, 5.7, 6.2, and 7.7 um AIBs, and thus the photochemical evolution of the AIB carriers. The 5.7 um AIB emission originates from at least two subpopulations, one more prominent in highly irradiated environments and one preferring more shielded environments. Smaller PAHs as well as very small grains or PAH clusters both thrive in the more shielded environments of the molecular zone in the Orion Bar. Based on these new diagnostics, we quantify the similarities between the AIB profiles observed in the Orion Bar and NGC7469.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurately localising fast radio bursts (FRBs) is essential for understanding their birth environments and for their use as cosmological probes. Recent advances in radio interferometry, particularly with MeerKAT, have enabled the localisation of individual bursts with arcsecond precision. In this work, we present the localisation of 15 apparently non-repeating FRBs detected with MeerKAT. Two of the FRBs, discovered in 2022, were localised in 8 second images from the projects which MeerTRAP was commensal to, while eight were localised using the transient buffer pipeline, and another one through SeeKAT, all with arcsecond precision. Four additional FRBs lacked TB triggers and sufficient signal, limiting their localisation only to arcminute precision. For nine of the FRBs in our sample, we identify host galaxies with greater than 90% confidence, while two FRBs have ambiguous associations with two host galaxy candidates. We measured spectroscopic redshifts for six host galaxies, ranging from 0.33 to 0.85, demonstrating MeerKAT's sensitivity to high redshift FRBs. For galaxies with sufficient photometric coverage, we performed spectral energy those of known FRB hosts. This work represents one of the largest uniform samples of well-localised distant FRBs to date, laying the groundwork for using MeerKAT FRBs as cosmological probes and understand how FRB hosts evolve at high redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 This project establishes parameters to characterize galaxy Star Formation History (SFH) beyond mean stellar age. We use ages at which fixed star fractions form to characterize SFH duration. We define Deltaage_n = (age_10 - age_90)/age_50 for SFH extension, where age_10, age_90, age_50 correspond to ages when 10%, 90%, and 50% of stars formed. Probability distributions for observed galaxies use robust Bayesian statistics comparing observed and model spectral features. We create composite stellar population (CSP) libraries using SEDlibrary software, implementing varied SFH, metallicity, and dust properties. We compare spectra using ten features: five spectral indices (D4000n, [Hdelta+Hgamma], Hbeta, [Mg_2Fe], [MgFe]') and five SDSS ugriz photometric fluxes. First, we focus on limiting Deltaage_n distinguishing extended from negligible SFH duration, Deltaage_n,min (time resolution). Using idealized CSP library of 5 million dust-free, burst-free models with fixed metallicities from subsolar to supersolar, Deltaage_n,min marks where spectral features depend on SFH duration. We find roughly flat log(Deltaage_n,min) around -0.3 dex over 4 magnitude orders in age. Deltaage_n,min decreases with higher SNR up to SNR=100, beyond which no improvement occurs. Second, we create mock datasets by perturbing 12,500 library models with realistic errors, testing retrieval capability for characteristic ages and SFH duration using realistic 500,000-model CSP library with up to 6 starbursts, dust, and variable metallicity. We constrain SFH duration log(Deltaage_n) within +-0.3 dex for most samples. For populations with strong Balmer absorption and mean age <10^9 yr, uncertainty exceeds 0.5 dex due to SFH degeneracies. These parameters will apply to current and upcoming deep spectroscopic galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamics of a rigid cometary nucleus is described by the evolutions of its center-of-mass and of its rotation state. Solar irradiation that reaches the surface of a cometary nucleus causes the sublimation of volatiles that form the coma around the nucleus. The sublimation process transfers linear momentum and rotational angular momentum from the nucleus to the surrounding space, and thus affects the dynamics via nongravitational forces and nongravitational torques. The 2014-2016 Rosetta mission accompanying the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko provides the longest continuous observational data to track its rotation state. The observed change in the rotation state is not explained by a low heat conductivity thermophysical model in combination with a homogeneous surface ice coverage of comet 67P. Spatially and/or temporally varying weights for effective active fraction with respect to a prescribed set of surface regions provide a potential solution to this problem. Here, we present a methodology for classifying the surface based on vectorial efficiency of the torque. On any cometary surface without geometric symmetry, the methodology highlights the decomposition into eight characteristic regions that encode the signs of torque efficiency with respect to all vector components. We analyze in detail rotation states close to lowest energy and different thermophysical models, and we discuss how the uncertainties of observations affect the model parameters. We study the occurrence of these regions for an oblate ellipsoid, a near-prolate ellipsoid, a bilobed shape, and a shape model analogous to that of comet 67P. The sensitivity analysis for comet 67P indicates that the observations constrain only one of the eight weights uniquely. The other directions are poorly constrained and show the limitation of the rotational data in determining regional activity.

 - **Abstract**
 In the light of new full-sky surveys, many attempts of creating a consistent Galactic model were made. The main interest is to estimate the still poorly understood dark matter content. However, the results vary depending on methodology, assumptions, and baryonic distribution used. To understand this discrepancy, we take the first step by estimating the model-free local mass density of stars and stellar remnants. We use a complete sample from the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars within 100 pc from the Sun, together with the data on the sample of the White Dwarfs and the recent estimate of the Neutron Stars concentration in the solar neighborhood. After correction for unresolved binary stars and accounting for missing low-mass stars, we find the local mass density of stars and stellar remnants in the solar neighborhood is $\rho_{100} = 0.040^{+0.012} _{ -0.006}M_\odot pc^{-3}$ with Kroupa IMF, and $\rho_{100} = 0.037^{+0.012}_{ -0.006}M_\odot pc^{-3}$ with Chabrier IMF.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of high gas-phase abundances of SO2 and SO in the cold envelope of an intermediate mass protostar suggests that these molecules might form on icy dust grains and subsequently desorb to the gas phase by non-thermal desorption processes such as photodesorption. In this work we report photodesorption yields for SO2 and, tentatively, SO upon ultraviolet photon irradiation of SO2 ice samples at temperatures between 14 and 80 K. Photodesorption yields were measured directly in the gas phase using a calibrated quadrupole mass spectrometer. Yields of 2.3 x 10-4 molecule/photon and 6 x 10-5 molecule/photon were estimated for SO2 and SO at 14 K (respectively). The SO2 photodesorption yield increased with temperature up to a value of 3.8 x 10-4 molecule/photon at 70 K, followed by a decrease at 80 K that could be due to crystallization of the sample. The signal assigned to SO photodesorption did not significantly change with temperature. The estimated photodesorption yields were included in the Nautilus gas-grain chemical model to evaluate their contribution to the SO2 and SO gas-phase abundances in an astrophysical environment. In addition, we also present a theoretically estimated band strength for the 1395 cm-1 SO3 IR feature (A = 1.1 x 10-16 cm molecule-1). SO3 is the main detected product in irradiated SO2 ices, and a potential contributor to the 7.2 um band observed in some interstellar ice IR spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 In star-forming disk galaxies, the radio continuum emission (1-10 GHz) powered by star formation has an integral polarization direction imperfectly aligned with the apparent disk minor axis. This polarization-shape alignment effect was previously observed in a small sample of local spirals. If this is prevalent for disk galaxies out to cosmological redshifts, novel measurements of cosmic birefringence and cosmic shear will be enabled by leveraging radio continuum surveys such as the Square Kilometre Array synergized with galaxy shape measurements. We calculate the polarization-shape misalignment angle for star-forming galaxies in the IllustrisTNG50 simulation at 0 < z < 2, assuming that additional polarized radio emission from an active galactic nucleus is negligible in at least a sizable fraction of the star-forming galaxies. The alignment found for z = 0 is consistent with local spiral data, but significantly deteriorates as redshift increases. Moreover, it degrades toward lower frequencies due to internal Faraday depolarization. Thanks to cosmic redshifting, observing higher-z galaxies at a fixed frequency greatly mitigates degradation due to reduced Faraday depolarization at the source-frame frequency. We present analytic fits to the non-Gaussian misalignment angle distribution, and evaluate Fisher information per galaxy for measuring a polarization rotation angle induced by cosmic birefringence. For observation at 4.8 GHz, the effective root-mean-square misalignment angle is 18°, 23°, and 33° at z = 0, 1 and 2, respectively. As accurate observation-driven models are not yet available for cosmological galaxy samples, our results motivate pilot observations to empirically characterize polarization-shape alignment, and can facilitate forecasts of cosmology and fundamental physics applications that exploit this effect.

 - **Abstract**
 The merger of binary pulsars in dark matter (DM)-rich environments can result in DM particle accretion, leading to an increase in the individual pulsar masses. In this work, we investigate the effects of DM accretion on the change in orbital period rate of binary pulsars. Our analysis reveals that while DM accretion increases the system's mass, it may also modify the orbital evolution by enhancing the orbital decay rate. By comparing our results with existing binary pulsar data near Earth's location, we report that the current DM accretion rate is insufficient to place meaningful constraints on DM particle properties. However, we demonstrate that future observations of pulsar mergers in the high DM-density environment of the galactic center could offer a unique opportunity to probe DM microphysics through this mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 HD 135344 AB is a young visual binary system that is best known for the protoplanetary disk around the secondary star. The circumstellar environment of the A0-type primary star, on the other hand, is already depleted. HD 135344 A is therefore an ideal target for the exploration of recently formed giant planets because it is not obscured by dust. We searched for and characterized substellar companions to HD 135344 A down to separations of about 10 au. We observed HD 135344 A with VLT/SPHERE in the $H23$ and $K12$ bands and obtained $YJ$ and $YJH$ spectroscopy. In addition, we carried out VLTI/GRAVITY observations for the further astrometric and spectroscopic confirmation of a detected companion. We discovered a close-in young giant planet, HD 135344 Ab, with a mass of about 10 $M_\mathrm{J}$. The multi-epoch astrometry confirms the bound nature based on common parallax and common proper motion. This firmly rules out the scenario of a non-stationary background star. The semi-major axis of the planetary orbit is approximately 15-20 au, and the photometry is consistent with that of a mid L-type object. The inferred atmospheric and bulk parameters further confirm the young and planetary nature of the companion. HD 135344 Ab is one of the youngest directly imaged planets that has fully formed and orbits on Solar System scales. It is a valuable target for studying the early evolution and atmosphere of a giant planet that could have formed in the vicinity of the snowline.
