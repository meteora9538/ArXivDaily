 - **Abstract**
 Due to their different nucleosynthetic origin, a stellar population produces oxygen (O) and iron (Fe) on different timescales and their relative abundance can deviate strongly from solar. Galaxy formation models should treat these elements separately, as they play a distinct role in shaping physical phenomena. For example, oxygen mainly sets the gas cooling rate, while the iron abundance sets stellar atmosphere opacities impacting stellar evolution, spectra and feedback. Observations of star-forming galaxies usually only constrain gas-phase oxygen abundance, vastly limiting our capabilities of separating the cosmic evolution of oxygen and iron. Here, we present an observationally-motivated framework to scale the cosmic evolution of O and Fe abundances. We apply the relation between the alpha-enhancement and galaxies' specific star formation rate ([O/Fe]-sSFR; Chruslinska et al. 2024) to derive the Fe and O-dependent cosmic star formation history (cSFH). We find that star formation with near-solar O/Fe is rare: at least 70% of the integrated cosmic stellar mass forms at non-solar O/Fe. The cosmic average metallicity is generally lower in [Fe/H] than in [O/H] (by up to a factor 3), with the offset increasing from redshifts z=0 to z~3 and then approaching the core-collapse O/Fe ratio. We validate our results against samples that probe the Fe-dependent cSFH in different regimes such as absorption-derived <[Fe/H]> from long gamma-ray bursts. Our results impact the interpretations of stellar and galaxy spectra and the predicted rates of transients, especially those linked to metal-poor progenitors (e.g., black hole mergers).

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the properties of a sample of z>6 bright (bolometric luminosity L$_{\rm bolo}$>10$^{46.25}$ erg/s) Quasars drawn from a realization of the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) model coupled with the Planck Millennium Simulation. We focus on the properties and environment of host galaxies, and their evolution down to z=0, with the aim of assessing how well the bright high redshift QSOs population traces the progenitors of most massive haloes in the local Universe. Our results show that at z>6 bright QSOs live in a variety of environments, and that secular processes like disc instability are responsible for triggering roughly the same number of QSOs as galaxy mergers. Half of cubic (7.5 $h^{-1}$ cMpc size) mock fields built around these high-z QSOs include other active galaxies (with L$_{\rm bolo}$>10$^{44}$ erg/s) in sizeable number, the other host galaxies being relatively isolated. The large field-to-field variance in the the number of companions (both active and non-active) recently reported from JWST observations is fairly well reproduced by GAEA predictions. Descendants of host galaxies at z=0 cover a wide range of physical properties and environments with only a small fraction of the hosts of high-z QSOs ending up in massive galaxy clusters. Viceversa, GAEA predicts that only a small fraction of Bright Central Galaxies have a bright z>6 QSOs among their progenitors. Our results suggest that luminous high-z QSO loosely trace the progenitors of low-z galaxy clusters, and that additional information about the environment of high-z QSOs are required to identify the most promising proto-cluster candidates.
#### A first look at a complete view of spatially resolved star formation at 1<z<1.8 with JWST NGDEEP+FRESCO slitless spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 [abridged] The previously inaccessible star formation tracer Pa$\alpha$ can now be spatially resolved by JWST NIRCam slitless spectroscopy in distant galaxies up to cosmic noon. In the first study of its kind, we combine JWST NGDEEP NIRISS and FRESCO NIRCam slitless spectroscopy to provide the first direct comparison of spatially resolved dust-obscured (traced by Pa$\alpha$) versus unobscured (traced by H$\alpha$) star formation across the main sequence. We stack Pa$\alpha$ and H$\alpha$ emission-line maps, along with stellar continuum images at both wavelengths of 31 galaxies at 1<z<1.8 in three bins of stellar mass. Surface brightness profiles are measured and equivalent width (EW) profiles computed. Increasing Pa$\alpha$ and H$\alpha$ EW profiles with galactocentric radius across all stellar masses probed provide direct evidence for the inside-out growth of galaxies both via dust-obscured and unobscured star formation for the first time. For galaxies on the main sequence, a weakly positive ($0.1\pm0.1$) Pa$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ line profile as a function of radius is found at $8.8\leqslant\mathrm{log}(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})<9.9$ with a negative ($-0.4\pm0.1$) Pa$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ line profile found at $9.9\leqslant\mathrm{log}(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})<11.0$. Low mass galaxies ($7.7\leqslant\mathrm{log}(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})<8.8$) with high sSFRs are found to have a negative ($-0.5\pm0.1$) Pa$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ line profile gradient. Our results demonstrate that while inside-out growth via star formation is ubiquitous across the main sequence just after cosmic noon, centrally concentrated dust attenuation is not. Along with other recent work in the literature, our findings motivate future studies of resolved SFR profiles in large samples of individual cosmic noon galaxies across the main sequence, to understand the intrinsic scatter in spatially resolved star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the deepest HI mass Function (HIMF) ever measured, outside the Local Group. The observations are part of the MeerKAT Fornax Survey and cover a 4 x 4 deg^2 field, corresponding to ~ Rvir. The 3$\sigma$ detection limit is log(MHI/Msun) = 5.7 for a 50 km/s-wide point source. We detect HI in 35 galaxies and 44 clouds with no optical counterparts. Using deep optical images from the Fornax Deep Survey, we show that the clouds are a distinct population, separated by a four magnitude gap from the faintest HI-detected galaxies. The majority (33 out of 44) of the clouds are associated with the two galaxies with the most HI in the cluster -- NGC 1365 and NGC 1427A, although the clouds contribute a negligible amount to the total MHI budget. By performing a SNR analysis and computing the Rauzy statistic on the HI detections, we demonstrate that our catalogue is complete down log(MHI/Msun) = 6, and we are therefore able to probe the HIMF down to this level. We find an abrupt drop of the number density of HI-detected galaxies at log(MHI/Msun) = 7, signifying a clear absence of galaxies between 6 < log(MHI/Msun) < 7. We use the modified maximum likelihood method to fit a Schechter function down to log(MHI/Msun) > 7, the range where the HIMF follows a power-law. The measured low-mass slope is $\alpha$ = -1.31 $\pm$ 0.13, with a characteristic knee mass of log(M*/Msun) = 10.52 $\pm$ 1.89. The low-mass slope matches the slope in the field, while the knee is defined by a single galaxy and is unconstrained. Below log(MHI/Msun) = 7, there is a sharp departure from a Schechter function, and we report the first robust measurement of the collapse of a HIMF. For the HIMF below log(MHI/Msun) = 7 to follow a power-law, tens of galaxies are needed -- a factor ~ six higher than what is observed. The collapse of the Fornax HIMF is likely due to the rapid removal of HI from low-mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) provides critical insights into the role of early galaxies in shaping the ionization state of the universe. However, because of the opacity of the intergalactic medium, it is often not possible to make direct measurements of the ionizing photon escape fraction ($f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\: \mathrm{LyC}}$) of high-redshift ($z \gtrsim 4$) galaxies. To explore the agreement and systematics of common indirect approaches, we applied six empirically calibrated diagnostics to predict $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\: \mathrm{LyC}}$ for the 45 nearby star-forming galaxies from the COS Legacy Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY). These methods- based on ultraviolet (UV) absorption lines, the UV continuum slope, Ly$\alpha$ kinematics, a multivariate model, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, and nebular emission line ratios- enable us to explore systematic differences between predictions and assess how galactic properties influence inferred LyC escape. Despite significant variations in method predictions, there is broad consistency in the resulting weak and strong LyC leaker classifications, with approximately half exhibiting predicted escape fractions $>$1%. We find evidence for two different pathways of LyC escape in nearby star-forming galaxies: (1) an early escape model driven by very young stellar populations, and (2) a delayed escape model that is consistent with supernova-driven outflows and time-dependent ISM clearing. The early escape model is favored among galaxies with a single, intense burst of recent star formation. In contrast, the delayed escape model is common among galaxies with more extended starburst histories. To interpret ionizing photon escape during the EoR, it will be necessary to recognize and understand this diversity in LyC escape mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Shock breakout and, in some cases, jet-driven high-energy emission are increasingly recognized as key signatures of the earliest phases of core-collapse supernovae, especially in Type IIn systems due to their dense, interaction-dominated circumstellar environments. We present a comprehensive photometric analysis of SN 2019vxm, a long-duration, luminous Type IIn supernova, $M_V^{}=-21.41\pm0.05\;{\rm mag}$, observed from X-ray to near-infrared. SN 2019vxm is the first superluminous supernovae Type IIn to be caught with well-sampled TESS photometric data on the rise and has a convincing coincident X-ray source at the time of first light. The high-cadence TESS light curve captures the early-time rise, which is well described by a broken power law with an index of $n=1.41\pm0.04$, significantly shallower than the canonical $n=2$ behavior. From this, we constrain the time of first light to within 7.2 hours. We identify a spatial and temporal coincidence between SN 2019vxm and the X-ray transient GRB191117A, corresponding to a $3.3\sigma$ association confidence. Both the short-duration X-ray event and the lightcurve modeling are consistent with shock breakout into a dense, asymmetric circumstellar medium, indicative of a massive, compact progenitor such as a luminous blue variable transitioning to Wolf-Rayet phase embedded in a clumpy, asymmetric environment.

 - **Abstract**
 We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec observations of the starless dark cloud Barnard 68 that reveal the spatially-resolved signature of cosmic-ray excited molecular hydrogen (CRXH$_2$) emissions for the first time. Following up on our initial detection of CRXH$_2$ emissions from B68 (Bialy et al. 2025), we now exploit JWST's sensitivity and spatial multiplexing to map CRXH$_2$ rovibrational lines across 16 sight lines through the cloud. By disentangling the CRXH$_2$ and UV-pumped H$_2$ components, we isolate the para-H$_2$-dominated spectrum attributable to cosmic-ray excitation. We find that there are significant spatial variations in the ratio of the CRXH$_2$ line intensity to the line-of-sight H$_2$ column density; these cannot be accounted for by dust extinction alone and demonstrate a clear attenuation of the cosmic-ray flux with increasing shielding column. Modeling B68 as a Bonnor-Ebert sphere, we constrain both the unshielded cosmic-ray ionization rate, $\zeta_{\rm H_2}$, and how it decreases with shielding column. At a reference depth of $N({\rm H}_2) = 3 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, we infer $\zeta_{\rm H_2} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$, a factor of $\approx 3$ higher than the average value derived from H$_3^+$ absorption studies. These results provide the most direct probe to date of cosmic-ray penetration into cold, dense gas, offering new constraints on both the microphysics of CR-H$_2$ interactions and the attenuation of low-energy cosmic rays in molecular clouds. Our findings establish CRXH$_2$ emission as a powerful new diagnostic of the cosmic-ray environment in interstellar space.

 - **Abstract**
 Bar structures are present in about half of local disk galaxies and play pivotal roles in secular galaxy evolution. Bars impose a non-axisymmetric perturbation to the rotating disk and transport gas inward to feed central starburst and, possibly, the activity of the nuclear supermassive black hole. They are believed to be long-lived structures and are now identified at redshift $z>2$. Yet, little is known about the onset and effect of bars in the early cosmic epoch because spectroscopy of distant bars at sufficient resolution is prohibitively expensive. Here, we report a kinematic study of a galactic bar at redshift 2.467, 2.6 billion years after the Big Bang. We observe the carbon monoxide and atomic carbon emission lines of the dusty star-forming galaxy J0107a and find the bar of J0107a has gas distribution and motion in a pattern identical to local bars. At the same time, the bar drives large-scale non-circular motions that dominate over disk rotation, funneling molecular gas into its center at a rate of $\approx600$ solar masses per year. Our results show that bar-driven dynamical processes and secular evolution were already at play 11.1 billion years ago, powering active star formation amid the gas-rich and far-infrared luminous growth phase in a massive disk galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST/NIRCam observations reveal dense stellar cores in high-redshift galactic bulges, indicative of sustained star formation and potential stellar accretion. We introduce accretion-modified star (AMS) as a new component in the chemical evolution of high-redshift bulges hosting active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The gas-phase chemical evolution of bulge environments containing AMS is modeled within 1 Gyr by combining population evolution and galactic chemical evolution formalisms, and observational signatures are tracked via photoionization modeling on Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagrams. Sustained high accretion onto AMSs leads to rapid gas-phase metal enrichment of the bulge, producing abundance peaks up to five times solar metallicity within 0.1 Gyr and significantly modifying elemental ratios in the gas phase. Atypical gas-phase abundance patterns during early, high-accretion phases and gradually diminish as the accretion rate declines. In BPT diagrams, high-AMS-accretion scenarios shift the modeled emission-line sequence toward the local AGN branch and extend into the high-metallicity regime. Super-solar narrow-line regions observed in AGNs at z>15 may reflect such AMS-driven gas-phase enrichment of host bulge under extreme gas densities. While direct detection of AMSs within AGN bulges remains challenging, the model provides testable predictions for future spectroscopic surveys and motivates further exploration of non-canonical stellar populations in AGN host bulges.
#### MAMMOTH-Grism: Revisiting the Mass-Metallicity Relation in Protocluster Environments at Cosmic Noon

 - **Abstract**
 We present one of the first measurements of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) in multiple massive protoclusters at cosmic noon, using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) G141 slitless spectroscopy from the MAMMOTH-Grism survey. We identify 63 protocluster member galaxies across three overdense structures at $z = 2\text{-}3$ with robust detections of [OIII], H$\beta$, and [OII] emission. The sample spans gas-phase metallicities of $12 + \log(\text{O/H}) = 8.2\text{-}8.6$, dust-corrected H$\beta$-based star formation rates (SFRs) of $10$-$250\,M_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$, and stellar masses of $M_\ast \sim 10^{9.4}$-$10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$, derived via spectral energy distribution fitting using deep HST and ground-based photometry. We stack spectra in five $M_\ast$ bins to obtain average metallicities and SFRs. Relative to field galaxies at similar redshifts, protocluster members show elevated SFRs at $M_\ast < 10^{10.25}\,M_\odot$ and a systematically shallower MZR: $12 + \log(\text{O/H}) = (6.96 \pm 0.13) + (0.143 \pm 0.017) \times \log(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})$. We detect a mass-dependent environmental offset: massive protocluster galaxies are metal-poor compared to field counterparts of similar mass, whereas lower-mass systems exhibit comparable or mildly enhanced metallicities. This trend is consistent with a scenario where cold-mode accretion dilutes the interstellar medium (ISM) across the full mass range, while efficient recycling of feedback-driven outflows preferentially enriches the ISM in low-mass galaxies. Finally, we assess the dependence of metallicity offsets on local overdensity and find no significant trend, likely reflecting the survey's bias toward protocluster cores.
#### Two Epochs of VLBI Observations of 8 KISSR Seyfert & LINER Galaxies: Suggestions of Fast and Filamentary Outflows

 - **Abstract**
 We present here the results from a second epoch of phase-referenced VLBA observations of 8 Seyfert and LINER galaxies from the KISSR sample. These sources were chosen based on the presence of double peaks or asymmetries in their emission lines as observed in SDSS spectra. Parsec-scale radio emission is detected in 7 of the 8 sources in the second epoch. Jet-like features appear to persist over a $\sim4-9$ year timeline in these `radio-quiet' AGN. A few sources like KISSR1494, however, show significantly different structures after a 9 year interval. KISSR102, which was previously suggested to be a binary black hole candidate based on the presence of two compact cores, shows the tentative signatures of superluminal jet motion ($1.05\pm0.45$c). Tentative superluminal motion in a jet knot has been reported in another source, KISSR872 ($1.65\pm0.57$c). We present 1.5 GHz images from the VLA A-array of 4 sources. These images reveal core-lobe or core-halo structures. The alignment of the VLBI jet direction with the kpc-scale spectral index gradient, as well as the mismatch between the star formation rate derived from the radio and H$\alpha$ line emission, support the suggestion that the kpc-scale emission is AGN-jet-related. The jets in KISSR sources appear to lose collimation over spatial scales between 200 parsec and 1 kpc. Overall, the characteristics of the KISSR jets are reminiscent of similar properties observed in VLBI monitoring studies of `radio-loud' AGN jets even as subtle differences related to the compactness and brightness of jet features remain.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel empirical method for correcting asteroid phase curves for rotational and geometrical effects using precomputed spin-and-shape models. Our approach normalizes sparse photometric data to a pole-on geometry, enabling consistent phase-curve fitting across apparitions. We fit both the H,G1,G2 and H,G12 phase functions to the normalized data. We also numerically derive new constraints on parameter ranges that ensure physically meaningful solutions. These constraints are based on the requirement that the reduced magnitude must monotonically decrease with phase angle and remain within plausible slope bounds. Compared to earlier bounds, our new constraints are more permissive. We also compare derivative-based and derivative-free optimization methods, highlighting convergence issues with the HG12 function and offering mitigation strategies. We applied our method to over 25,000 asteroids observed by the ATLAS survey, demonstrating its usability. The new method enables the selection of the preferred spin-and-shape solution based on either statistical phase-curve model selection criteria and/or physically motivated constraints on the phase-curve shape.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent preference for a dynamical dark energy (DE) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument seems to call for interactions between DE and dark matter (DM), either from direct DM-DE interaction or indirect interaction induced by modified gravity. Therefore, an independent probe for these kinds of DE-DM interactions would be appealing from observational aspects. In this paper, we propose the black hole superradiance as a novel astrophysical probe for field-theoretic interacting DE-DM models, providing complementary constraints independent of large-scale cosmological observations. The core principle is that the DE-DM interaction can alter the effective mass of the superradiant ultralight boson, thereby modifying its superradiant instability rate around spinning black holes. We explore this connection through two distinct scenarios: a model where the DE field mediates a dark fifth force within the DM sector, affecting the superradiance from DM particles; and a novel mechanism where the DE field itself becomes superradiant due to the effective mass enhancement induced by dense DM spikes around supermassive black holes. By applying a statistical framework to black hole observations in both scenarios, we derive constraints on the fundamental DE-DM coupling strength. Although the current constraints are rather loose due to small samples and inaccurate measurements, our work provides new astrophysical constraints on these interacting DE-DM scenarios and establishes a new synergy between black hole physics and cosmology for probing the fundamental nature of the dark sector.

 - **Abstract**
 The galaxy size-luminosity and size-stellar mass relations are important constraints on the galactic baryon cycle of gas accretion, star formation, and feedback. There are conflicting claims in the literature regarding how environment influences size: both direct transformative effects and `assembly bias' may contribute to observed variations with environment. We construct a large homogeneous sample of size measurements to M*~10^7 Msun. Our sample fills a gap in field galaxy size measurements around 10^7-10^8 Msun; the literature at these masses is biased towards satellites of L* galaxies and members of galaxy clusters. We use sizes from the DESI-LS, together with a published catalog that contains stellar masses and cluster positions derived from DESI-LS photometry. Our sample extends to z<0.3 and comprises 540,228 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts and 9,513,732 galaxies with photometric redshifts. We explore the environmental dependence of size for a mass-limited subset of our sample at z<0.05, based on distance to the nearest cluster center. We obtain size-luminosity and size-mass relations in good agreement with previous studies. By separating galaxies according to color and morphology, we show that the environmental variation of the overall size-mass relation on Mpc scales can be understood as the consequence of a changing mixture of subpopulations, rather than direct size transformation. For example, at fixed mass, quiescent (red) late-type galaxies within 2Mpc of a cluster have the same size as quiescent late-type galaxies 30Mpc from the nearest cluster. Our results support individual galaxy assembly histories as the primary determinant of galaxy size. The existence of significantly different, environment-insensitive size mass relations for subpopulations separated by color and Sersic index provides a clear target for calibration of the baryon cycle in cosmological simulations.

 The measurement of dust size from millimeter-wavelength spectra provides direct constraints on grain growth in protoplanetary disks. The spectral indices between 0.88 mm and 2.9 mm have been measured in multiple young star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Ophiuchus, and Lupus, which have ages of 1-3 Myr. These spectral indices are as low as 2-3, suggesting that grains in disks are much larger than those in the interstellar medium. In this study, we analyze the ALMA archival data of 23 disks in the Upper Scorpius region. The observed wavelength is 2.9 mm in Band 3, the angular resolution is 3.3 arcsec x 2.1 arcsec, which is not high enough to resolve the targets, and the rms noise is below 0.075 mJy beam$^{-1}$ for almost all sources. Together with the literature values of the Band 7 fluxes of the same targets, we find that the average spectral index of the disks in the Upper Scorpius region is $\alpha_\mathrm{mm}=2.09 \pm 0.10$, which is equal to or slightly smaller than those at the other younger regions. To explain the relationship between the fluxes and spectral indices of the disks in the Taurus, Ophiuchus, Lupus, and Upper Scorpius regions, we construct simple disk evolution models. The observations are best reproduced by models in which the inner radius of the disk increases. This suggests that a substantial amount of dust mass must persist in the outer disk regions where the dust temperature is lower than 20 K even at late evolutionary stages. These findings offer key insights into the grain growth and the temporal evolution of protoplanetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino flavor evolution in dense astrophysical environments is inherently nonlinear and sensitive to many-body (MB) quantum effects beyond the mean-field (MF) approximation. Existing MB studies are constrained by small system sizes, closed boundaries, and highly idealized symmetry assumptions. We present a unified tensor-network framework that enables simulations of inhomogeneous and anisotropic flavor evolution under conditions relevant to core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers. Within this framework, we examine the effects of inhomogeneity, boundary conditions, and convergence with resolution for multiple neutrino distributions, allowing direct comparison of these setups under one consistent formulation. In our simulations, many-body systems equilibrate earlier than their mean-field counterparts while approaching similar final flavor states. Enlarging the interaction region allows open boundaries to reproduce closed-system behavior, but only when the beams begin superimposed and interact continuously. By contrast, initially separated configurations develop entanglement more slowly, interact over longer times, and equilibrate to a flavor content that differs from that obtained from initially superimposed calculations.

 - **Abstract**
 Passively cooling neutron stars (NSs) should reach undetectably low surface temperatures $T_s<10^4$ K in less than $10^7$ yr. However, HST observations have revealed likely thermal UV emission from the Gyr-old millisecond pulsars PSR~J0437$-$4715 and PSR~J2124$-$3358, and from the $\sim10^{7-8}$ yr-old classical pulsars PSR~B0950$+$08 and PSR~J0108$-$1431, implying $T_s\sim10^5$ K and the need for heating mechanisms. We compute the thermal evolution of these NSs including rotochemical heating (RH) in the core with normal or Cooper-paired matter, vortex creep (VC) in the inner crust, and crustal heating through nuclear reactions, and compare the results with observations and with the upper limit for PSR~2144$-$3933. No single mechanism explains all sources. The high temperature of PSR~J0437$-$4715 can be reproduced by RH with a large Cooper pairing gap $\Delta_i\sim1.5$ MeV for either neutrons or protons, but this requires an unrealistically short initial period $P_0\lesssim1.8$ ms to activate the same mechanism in PSR~B0950$+$08. Conversely, the latter can be explained by RH with modified Urca reactions in normal matter or by VC with an excess angular momentum $J\sim3\times10^{43}$ erg,s, but these models underpredict PSR~J0437$-$4715. A model combining RH with a large pairing gap and VC matches both pulsars and is consistent with the upper limits for the remaining three. It further predicts that their temperatures should lie close to these limits, suggesting that deeper or broader-wavelength observations would provide a strong test of this scenario.
