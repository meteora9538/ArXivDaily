 - **Abstract**
 The identification of stellar structures in the Galactic halo, including stellar streams and merger remnants, often relies on the dynamics of their constituent stars. However, this approach has limitations due to the complex dynamical interactions between these structures and their environment. Perturbations such as tidal forces exerted by the Milky Way, the potential escape of stars, and passages through the Galactic plane can result in the loss of dynamical coherence of stars in these structures. Consequently, relying solely on dynamics may be insufficient for detecting such disrupted or dispersed remnants. We combine chemistry and dynamics, integrated through a system of neural networks, to develop a clustering method for identifying accreted structures in the Galactic halo. We developed an integrated approach combining Siamese neural networks (SNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), autoencoders, and the OPTICS algorithm to create a comprehensive procedure named CREEK. This method is designed to uncover stellar structures in the Galactic halo. Initially, CREEK was trained on known globular clusters (GCs) and then applied to the dataset to identify stellar streams. CREEK successfully recovered 80% of the GCs present in the APOGEE dataset, re-identified several known stellar streams, and identified a potential new stream. Additionally, within highly populated stellar structures, CREEK can identify substructures that exhibit distinct chemical compositions and orbital energies. This approach provides an objective data-driven method for selecting stars associated with streams and stellar structures in general.
#### MIRACLE II: Unveiling the multi-phase gas interplay in the circumnuclear region of NGC 1365 via multi-cloud modeling

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-phase study of the gas in the circumnuclear region (~1.1x1.0 kpc^2) of the nearby Seyfert 1.8 galaxy NGC 1365, observed in the context of the Mid-IR Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE) program. We combined spatially resolved spectroscopic observations from JWST/MIRI, VLT/MUSE, and ALMA to investigate the ionized atomic gas and the warm and cold molecular phases. MIRI data revealed over 40 mid-IR emission lines from ionized and warm molecular gas. Moment maps show that both cold and warm molecular gas follow the rotation of the stellar disk along the circumnuclear ring. The ionized gas displays flux and kinematic patterns that depend on ionization potential (IP): low-IP species (<25 eV) trace the disk, while higher-IP lines (up to ~120 eV) trace outflowing material. The [O III]5700 and [Ne V]14 lines both trace the southeast nuclear outflow cone. Additionally, [Ne V]14 detects the northwest counter-cone, obscured in the optical and thus invisible in [O III]5700. Mid-IR diagnostics, unlike optical ones, clearly reveal the AGN as the primary ionization source in the nucleus. Emission from high-IP species is spatially coincident with the ionization cones and not with star-forming regions. Using the [Ne V]24/[Ne V]14 ratio, we derive an electron density of (750+-440) cm^(-3), in agreement with values from the [S II] optical doublet. For the first time, we apply a fully self-consistent approach combining advanced photoionization and kinematic models (HOMERUN+MOKA3D) to constrain intrinsic outflow properties, overcoming the limitations of simplified classical methods. Exploiting the synergy of JWST/MIRI and VLT/MUSE, HOMERUN reproduces fluxes of over 60 emission lines from optical to mid-IR, disentangling AGN and star formation contributions and yielding robust estimates of outflow mass, geometry, and energetics.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova 2023ixf occurred on May 18th 2023 in the nearby galaxy Messier 101 (D ~ 6.85 Mpc), making it the closest supernova in the last decade. Following its discovery, astronomers around the world rushed to observe the explosion across the electromagnetic spectrum in order to uncover its early-time properties. Based on multi-wavelength analysis during its first year post-explosion, supernova 2023ixf is a type II supernova that interacted with dense, confined circumstellar material in its local environment -- this material being lost from its red supergiant progenitor in the final years before explosion. In this article, we will review the findings of >80 studies already published on this incredible event as well as explore how the synthesis of SN 2023ixf observations across the electromagnetic spectrum can be used to constrain both type II supernova explosion physics in addition to the the uncertain mass loss histories of red supergiant stars in their final years.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most commonly observed solar radio sources in the metric and decametric wavelengths is the solar noise storm. These are generally associated with active regions and are believed to be powered by the plasma emission mechanism. Since plasma emission emits primarily at the fundamental and harmonic of the local plasma frequency, it is significantly affected by density inhomogeneities in the solar corona. The source can become significantly scatter-broadened due to the multi-path propagation caused by refraction from the density inhomogeneities. Past observational and theoretical estimates suggest some minimum observable source size in the solar corona. The details of this limit, however, depends on the modeling approach and details of the coronal turbulence model chosen. Hence pushing the minimum observable source size to smaller values can help constrain the plasma environment of the observed sources. In this work, we for the first time, use data from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope in the 250--500 MHz band, to determine multiple instances of very small-scale structures in the noise storms. We also find that these structures are stable over timescales of 15--30 minutes. By comparing the past observations of Type III radio bursts and noise storms, we hypothesize that the primary reason behind the detection of these small sources in noise storm is due to the local environment of the noise storm. We also build an illustrative model and propose some conditions under which the minimum observable source size predicted by theoretical models, can be lowered significantly.
#### JWST Discovery of Warm Dust in the Circumgalactic Medium of the Makani Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of near- and mid-infrared emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) out to ~ 35 kpc in the Makani Galaxy, a compact massive galaxy with a record-breaking 100-kpc scale starburst-driven wind at redshift z = 0.459. The NIRCam and MIRI observations with JWST take advantage of a coincidental match between the PAH spectral features at 3.3, 7.7, and (11.3 + 12.2) microns in Makani and the bandpasses of the MIRI and NIRCam filters. The warm dust is not only detected in the cool-gas tracers of the galactic wind associated with the more recent (7 Myr) starburst episode, but also in the outer warm-ionized gas wind produced by the older (0.4 Gyr) episode. The presence of PAHs in the outer wind indicates that the PAHs have survived the long (R/v ~ 10^8 yrs) journey to the halo despite the harsh environment of the galactic wind. The measured F1800W/F1130W flux ratios in the unresolved nucleus, inner halo (R = 10 - 20 kpc), and outer halo (R = 20 - 35 kpc), tracers of the PAH (11.3 + 12.2)/7.7 ratios, indicate decreasing starlight intensity incident on the PAHs, decreasing PAH sizes, and increasing PAH ionization fractions with increasing distance from the nucleus. These data provide the strongest evidence to date that the ejected dust of galactic winds survives the long journey to the CGM, but is eroded along the way.

 - **Abstract**
 The gas-phase metallicity affects heating and cooling processes in the star-forming galactic interstellar medium (ISM) as well as ionising luminosities, wind strengths, and lifetimes of massive stars. To investigate its impact, we conduct magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the ISM using the FLASH code as part of the SILCC project. The simulations assume a gas surface density of 10 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ and span metallicities from 1/50 Z$_\odot$ to 1 Z$_\odot$. We include non-equilibrium thermo-chemistry, a space- and time-variable far-UV background and cosmic ray ionisation rate, metal-dependent stellar tracks, the formation of HII regions, stellar winds, type II supernovae, and cosmic ray injection and transport. With the metallicity decreasing over the investigated range, the star formation rate decreases by more than a factor of ten, the mass fraction of cold gas decreases from 60% to 2.3%, while the volume filling fraction of the warm gas increases from 20% to 80%. Furthermore, the fraction of H$_\mathrm{2}$ in the densest regions drops by a factor of four, and the dense ISM fragments into approximately five times fewer structures at the lowest metallicity. Outflow mass loading factors remain largely unchanged, with values close to unity, except for a significant decline at the lowest metallicity. Including the major processes that regulate ISM properties, this study highlights the strong impact of gas phase metallicity on the star-forming ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 newASTROGAM is a breakthrough mission concept for the study of the non-thermal Universe from space with gamma rays in the energy range from 15 keV to 3 GeV. It is based on advanced space-proven detector technologies, which will achieve unprecedented sensitivity, angular and energy resolution combined with polarimetric capability. Since the MeV gamma-ray energy range is the most under-explored electromagnetic window to the Universe, a mission in this energy range can for the first time sensitively address fundamental astrophysics questions connected to the physics of compact objects and merger events, jets and their environments, supernovae and the origin of the elements, potentially constrain the nature of dark matter and many more science objectives. The mission will detect and follow-up many of the key sources of multi-messenger astronomy in the 2040s. newASTROGAM provides an unprecedentedly broad energy coverage from keV to GeV energies. The payload concept consists of a Silicon tracker combined with a crystal calorimeter. Both detectors are surrounded by an anti-coincidence detector to reject charged cosmic rays. In addition, a thin X-ray coded mask provides very good imaging capabilities. Such a mission can uniquely detect gamma rays via the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering and electron-positron pair production. newASTROGAM is proposed to the ESA call for medium-class mission ideas (M8).

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy clusters produce a very hostile environment to galaxies, whose gas gets stripped by ram-pressure, suffer galaxy interactions and witness quenching of their star formation. Clusters, like Abell 2142, grow not only through galaxy accretion but also through group infall. Our goal is to study the physical and dynamical state of the most conspicuous infalling group, on a filament projected at 1.3 Mpc from the Abell 2142 centre. The galaxy group is the leading edge of a spectacular trailing 700-kpc-long X-ray tail of hot gas stripped by ram-pressure. The infalling galaxies are not quenched yet, and are ideal objects to study the transformation processes due to the cluster environment. We use integral field spectroscopy from MaNGA to derive stellar and gas kinematics, and MegaCam for ugr photometry. Stellar populations (with age and metallicity) are obtained through full-spectrum fitting using Nburst. The gas kinematics and excitation are derived from the line emission of H$\alpha$, [NII], [OIII] and H$\beta$. The group contains four galaxies, of which two are merging and partly superposing on the line of sight. With a simple parametric model for each velocity field, we succeed in disentangling the contribution of each galaxy and derive their physical state and kinematics. The galaxies are perturbed, and intra-group gas is observed as tidal tails and loops. They are mainly disks in rotation, although some regions reveal elevated dispersion, typical of out-of-equilibrium gas. All galaxies show sustained star formation, with a global star formation rate of 45 M$_\odot$/yr. We conclude that the long X-ray tail must have come from the hot intra-group medium, present before the group infall, and does not correspond to the ram-pressure stripping of the galaxy gas. The galaxy interactions within the group are still enhancing the star formation, from the disks that are still rich in dense gas.
#### GW231123: a Binary Black Hole Merger with Total Mass 190-265 $M_{\odot}$

 - **Abstract**
 On 2023 November 23 the two LIGO observatories both detected GW231123, a gravitational-wave signal consistent with the merger of two black holes with masses $137^{+22}_{-17}\, M_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52}\, M_\odot$ (90\% credible intervals), at luminosity distance 0.7-4.1 Gpc and redshift of $0.39^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$, and a network signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim$22.5. Both black holes exhibit high spins, $0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$ respectively. A massive black hole remnant is supported by an independent ringdown analysis. Some properties of GW231123 are subject to large systematic uncertainties, as indicated by differences in inferred parameters between signal models. The primary black hole lies within or above the theorized mass gap where black holes between 60-130 $M_\odot$ should be rare due to pair instability mechanisms, while the secondary spans the gap. The observation of GW231123 therefore suggests the formation of black holes from channels beyond standard stellar collapse, and that intermediate-mass black holes of mass $\sim$200 $M_\odot$ form through gravitational-wave driven mergers.
#### Evidence of .Ia Supernova Detonations in 3D Hydrodynamical Simulations of Double Degenerate Mergers

 - **Abstract**
 We report detailed 3D simulations of 1.1 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ Oxygen-Neon (ONe) white dwarfs (WDs) merging with a 0.35 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ helium WD, conducted with the moving-mesh hydrodynamic code AREPO. The simulations utilise self-consistent chemical profiles for the primary WD which were generated by a stellar evolution code incorporating the effects of semi-degenerate carbon burning. We find that a helium detonation is ignited at the base of the helium layer, starting a thermonuclear runaway which encircles the WD and ejects material as a sub-luminous supernovae. Our canonical simulation, (C-120), ejects 0.103 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ of primarily $^{4}\mathrm{He}$, $^{28}\mathrm{Si}$, and $^{32}\mathrm{S}$, after which the primary begins accreting again from the surviving secondary. Our results depend qualitatively on the "inspiral time" simulation parameter, which describes the length of a period of accelerated angular momentum loss. For example, the binary does not survive when inspiral time is too long. We compare the results using our self-consistent chemical profiles to a constant-composition WD structure and find the same explosion pattern when the inspiral time is short. However, we are able to obtain a typical Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) which destroys the primary by using the constant-composition structure and long inspiral. The shock-convergence in this simulation follows the "x-scissor mechanism" described by Gronow et al. in 2020, and causes a secondary detonation due to higher temperatures and higher number density of $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ at the convergence site. These results highlight the potential for unrealistic outcomes when conducting simulations that incorporate unrealistically large enhancements in angular momentum losses and (or) non-realistic chemical structures for the primary WD.
#### The JWST Spectroscopic Properties of Galaxies at $z=9-14$

 - **Abstract**
 We characterize the JWST spectra of $61$ galaxies at $z=9-14$, including $30$ newly-confirmed galaxies. We directly compare the $z>9$ spectroscopic properties against $401$ galaxies at $6<z<9$, with the goal of identifying evolution in the star formation histories and ISM. We measure rest-UV emission line properties and UV continuum slopes, while also investigating the rest-optical emission lines for the subset of galaxies at $9.0<z<9.6$. With these spectra, we constrain the stellar masses, specific star formation rates, dust attenuation, and the average metallicity and abundance pattern of $z>9$ galaxies. Our dataset indicates that the emission lines undergo a marked change at $z>9$, with extremely large CIII], H$\beta$, and H$\gamma$ EWs becoming $2-3\times$ more common at $z>9$ relative to $6<z<9$. Using the spectra, we infer the distribution of SFRs on short (SFR$_{\rm 3Myr}$) and medium (SFR$_{\rm 3-50Myr}$) timescales, finding that rapid SFR upturns (large SFR$_{\rm 3Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm 3-50Myr}$ ratios) are significantly more likely among $z>9$ galaxies. These results may reflect a larger dispersion in UV luminosity at fixed halo mass and larger baryon accretion rates at $z>9$, although other physical effects may also contribute. We suggest that the shift in star formation conditions explains the prevalence of extreme nebular spectra that have been detected at $z>9$, with hard ionizing sources and nitrogen-enhancements becoming more typical at the highest redshifts. Finally, we identify five $z>9$ spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with red UV colors ($\beta\gtrsim-1.5$), either revealing a small population with moderate dust attenuation ($\tau_V=0.23-0.35$) or very high density nebular-dominated galaxies with hot stellar populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) play a crucial role in galaxy evolution by influencing the observational properties of their host galaxies. We investigate the host galaxy properties of X-ray selected AGNs, focusing on differences between obscured and unobscured AGNs, and between high-(log([OIII]5007/H$\beta$}$>$0.5) and low-excitation sources (log([OIII]5007/H$\beta$$<$0.5). We selected a sample of AGNs from the spectroscopic zCOSMOS survey with 0.5 $< zsp <$ 0.9 based on the Mass-Excitation (MEx) diagram and X-ray emission. AGNs were classified as obscured or unobscured using hydrogen column density, and as high- or low-excitation based on the [OIII]5007/H$\beta$ ratio. We analysed various AGN properties, including the hardness ratio, X-ray luminosity, emission line ratios such as the ionisation-level sensitive parameter O32=log([OIII]5007/[OII]3727), and the metallicity sensitive parameter R23=log(([OIII]5007+[OII]3727/H$\beta$), and the specific black hole accretion rate. Unobscured AGNs exhibit a more evident correlation between the [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 ionisation ratio and X-ray luminosity than obscured AGNs, while high-excitation obscured AGNs reach, on average, higher X-ray luminosities. Furthermore, high-excitation AGNs typically show high values of R23, suggesting low metallicities, similar to that observed in high-redshift galaxies (4 $< z <$ 6). We find a positive correlation between the parameters $\lambda$sBHAR and N$_H$, R23 and O32 parameters. The correlation suggests that AGNs with a high specific accretion rate have not only a higher production of high-energy photons, which ionise the surrounding medium more intensely, but are also usually associated with environments less enriched in heavy elements. These results provide insights into the complex interplay between AGN activity, host galaxy properties, and the role of obscuration in shaping galaxy evolution.
#### Einstein Probe discovery of the short period intermediate polar EP J115415.8-501810

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray transient source EP240309a/EP\,J115415.8$-$501810 was first detected by the Wide-Field X-ray Telescope (WXT) on board Einstein Probe (EP) during the commissioning phase. Subsequent optical observations confirmed it as a Cataclysmic Variable of the intermediate polar type with a 238.2\,s spinning white dwarf in a $\sim$3.76\,hr orbit. We report on the source discovery and follow-up studies made with the Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT) of EP. A periodic variation of 231\,s is detected in the 0.3$-$2\,keV band, while no obvious pulsation appears in the 2$-$10\,keV band. The spectral analysis shows that the X-ray emission could be described by an absorbed bremsstrahlung model with $kT$\textgreater\,11\,keV. The partial covering absorption, with an hydrogen column density $N_H$ = 2.0$\times 10^{22}\,\rm cm^{-2}$ and covering fraction around 0.9, is much larger than the interstellar absorption along the line of sight. According to the distance $d = 309.5$\,pc obtained from Gaia parallax, we estimate that the luminosity of this source in the 0.3$-$10\,keV range is $\sim 2\times10^{32}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. In addition, phase-resolved spectral analysis reveals that the detected periodic variation is mainly caused by the change in the absorption column density. In this scenario the spin modulation arises due to absorption from the pre-shock accretion flow of the X-ray emitting pole, while the optical radiation is modulated at the orbital side band ($\omega_{\rm spin} - \Omega_{\rm orbit}$) due to reprocessing in regions within the binary system. Due to its unusual transient behaviour for an intermediate polar, we have also searched for radio signals similar to those observed in the new class of long period transients. We derived upper limits with ASKAP (200--300\,$\mu$Jy\,beam$^{-1}$ between 800--1500 MHz) and MWA (40--90\,mJy\,beam$^{-1}$ between 80--300 MHz).

 - **Abstract**
 We have obtained spectroscopic observations for four short-period variable objects detected in ZTF, Gaia, and Pan-STARRS (ZGP) data and classified as Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) in McWhirter and Lam (2022): ZGP-BLAP-03, ZGP-BLAP-04, ZGP-BLAP-10, and ZGP-BLAP-15. The variables have periods between 46 and 56 min, full amplitudes of 0.13-0.22 mag in the $r$ band, and light curve shapes typical for radially pulsating stars. Three of them were found at high galactic latitudes (|$b$|>30 deg). We have identified object ZGP-BLAP-03 as an early F-type star, while objects ZGP-BLAP-04 and ZGP-BLAP-15 as low-metallicity late A-type stars. These are the three objects found at high galactic latitudes and located several kiloparsecs from the Sun. Thus, they are SX Phoenicis-type variable stars residing in the Galactic halo. In the case of low-latitude object ZGP-BLAP-10, we report the presence of helium lines in its spectrum and atmospheric parameters in agreement with known BLAPs. This and other results indicate that BLAPs are absent in metal-poor environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Star formation and, in particular, high-mass star formation are key astrophysical processes that are far from being fully understood. Unfortunately, progress in these fields is slow because observations are hard to interpret as they cannot be directly compared to numerical simulations. Synthetic observations are therefore necessary to better constrain the models. Aims. With the Rosetta Stone project, we aim to develop an end-to-end pipeline to compare star formation simulations with observations as accurately as possible in order to study the evolution from clumps scales to stars. Methods. Using the adaptive mesh-refinement code RAMSES, we computed a first grid of model of star-forming clumps to develop our pipeline and explore the impact of the clump initial conditions on their evolution. The main purpose of this set of simulations is to be converted into synthetic observations to enable a direct comparison with real star-forming clumps observed with Herschel and ALMA. Results. The Rosetta Stone simulations presented here provide a catalog available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with observations (RS1). Among all the parameters explored here, the strength of the magnetic field has the strongest influence on the clump evolution (fragmentation, star formation, global collapse) at both large and small scales. Numerical parameters such as the resolution per Jeans length or the threshold for accretion onto sink particles affects the formation of low-mass sinks. Finally, the widely used L/M ratio is found to be a good indicator of the clump evolutionary state regardless of its initial condition, but this could change when more feedback processes (jets, HII regions) are included. Conclusions. We now have a new suite of simulations of star-forming clumps that is available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with the observations,

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the $\gamma$-ray emission above 100~MeV from the GOES M3.3 flare SOL2012-06-03. The hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave emissions have typical time profiles with a fast rise to a well-defined peak followed by a slower decay. The $>$100~MeV emission during the prompt phase displayed a double-peaked temporal structure with the first peak following the HXR and microwaves, and the second one, about three times stronger, occurring $17 \pm 2$ seconds later. The time profiles seem to indicate two separate acceleration mechanisms at work, where the second $\gamma$-ray peak reveals a potentially pure or at least largely dominant ion acceleration. The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly imaging shows a bright elliptical ribbon and a transient brightening in the north-western (NW) region. Nonlinear force-free extrapolations at the time of the impulsive peaks show closed field lines connecting the NW region to the south-eastern part of the ribbon and the magnetic topology revealed clusters of nulls. These observations suggest a spine-and-fan geometry, and based on these observations we interpret the second $\gamma$-ray peak as being due to the predominant acceleration of ions in a region with multiple null points. The $>$100 MeV emission from this flare also exhibits a delayed phase with an exponential decay of roughly 350 seconds. We find that the delayed emission is consistent with ions being trapped in a closed flux tube with gradual escape via their loss cone to the chromosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying the progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae (Type Ia supernovae; SNe Ia) remains a key objective in contemporary astronomy. The rare subclass of SNe Ia that interacts with circumstellar material (Type Ia-CSM) allows for studies of the progenitor's environment before explosion, and generally favours single-degenerate progenitor channels. The case of SN Ia-CSM PTF11kx clearly connected thermonuclear explosions with hydrogen-rich CSM-interacting events, and the more recent SN 2020eyj connected SNe Ia with helum-rich companion progenitors. Here we present a study of SN 2020aeuh, a Type Ia-CSM with delayed interaction. We analyse photometric and spectroscopic data that monitor the evolution of SN 2020aeuh and compare its properties with those of peculiar SNe Ia and core-collapse SNe. At early times, the evolution of SN 2020aeuh resembles a slightly overluminous SN Ia. Later, the interaction-dominated spectra develop the same pseudocontinuum seen in Type Ia-CSM PTF11kx and SN 2020eyj. However, the later-time spectra of SN 2020aeuh lack hydrogen and helium narrow lines. Instead, a few narrow lines could be attributed to carbon and oxygen. We fit the pseudobolometric light curve with a CSM-interaction mode, yielding a CSM mass of 1-2 M$_{\odot}$. We propose that SN 2020aeuh was a Type Ia supernova that eventually interacted with a dense medium which was deficient in both hydrogen and helium. Whereas previous SNe Ia-CSM constitute our best evidence for nondegenerate companion progenitors, the CSM around SN 2020aeuh is more difficult to understand. We include a hydrodynamical simulation for a double-degenerate system to showcase how the dynamical evolution of such a progenitor scenario could produce the CSM observed around SN 2020aeuh. It is clear that SN 2020aeuh challenges current models for stellar evolution leading up to a SN Ia explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the distribution of missing baryons in cosmic filaments by stacking approximately 31,300 filaments across the northern and southern SDSS sky regions using Planck Compton-$y$ and CMB lensing maps. Filaments are identified using the DisPerSE algorithm applied to the SDSS LOWZ-CMASS galaxy samples, selecting structures with lengths between 30-100 cMpc and redshifts in the range $0.2 < z < 0.6$. Radial profiles are extracted out to 25 cMpc from the filament spines, and galaxy clusters with halo masses above $3 \times 10^{13}$ solar masses are masked to reduce contamination. We detect the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) signal at $7.82\sigma$ and the CMB lensing signal at $7.78\sigma$. The stacked profiles are corrected by a geometric bias related to filament inclination with respect to the line of sight, and modeled assuming isothermal, cylindrically symmetric gas distributions. We explore different gas and matter density distributions, focusing on $\beta$-models with $(\alpha, \beta) = (2, 2/3)$ or $(1, 1)$. By jointly fitting the Compton-$y$ and lensing convergence profiles, we constrain the central electron overdensity and temperature to be $\delta = 5.90^{+4.18}_{-1.98}$ and $T_e = 2.71^{+0.63}_{-0.51} \times 10^6$ K for the standard $\beta$-model. These results suggest that the filamentary WHIM in our selected long filaments contributes a significant baryon fraction of $0.124^{+0.020}_{-0.021} \times$ {\Omega}_b to the cosmic baryon budget.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the {\it Hubble Space Telescope}/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, ultraviolet (UV) extinction curves have been measured in M31 along thirteen new sightlines, increasing the M31 sample to seventeen. This sample covers a wide area of M31 having galactocentric distances of 5 to 16 kpc, enabling the analysis of UV extinction curve variations over a large region of an external galaxy similar to the Milky Way with global galactic characteristics such as metallicity for the first time. No correlation is found between the extinction parameters and galactocentric distance which might be expected if there is a radial metallicity gradient in M31. Most of the new UV extinction curves presented here are significantly different from the average extinction curves of the Milky Way, LMC, and SMC, but the average M31 extinction curve is similar to the average extinction curve in the 30-Dor region of the LMC. The wide range of extinction curves seen in each individual Local Group galaxy suggests that global galactic properties such as metallicity may be less important than the local environmental conditions such as density, UV radiation field, and shocks along each sightline. The combined behavior of the Milky Way, LMC, SMC, and now M31 UV extinction curves supports the idea that there is a family of curves in the Local Group with overlapping dust grain properties between different galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed spectroscopic study of ionised gas in the nearby (~3.3Mpc) dwarf galaxy NGC 2366, a local analogue of Green Pea galaxies, based on observations with the SCORPIO-2 instrument at the Russian 6-m BTA telescope. Using scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry and long-slit spectroscopy, we examine the gas kinematics, excitation mechanisms, and chemical abundances across the disc of NGC 2366, including its prominent starburst region Mrk 71 and the companion region NGC 2363. We identified 20 regions with locally elevated Ha velocity dispersion, only four of which correspond to known high-energy sources. We argue that one of the remaining objects can be a previously unidentified Wolf-Rayet star and two - supernova remnants. For 15 HII regions, we measure electron temperatures, oxygen and nitrogen abundances via the `direct' Te method, with 12 + log(O/H) ranging from 7.6 to 8.0 in most of the regions. We show that Mrk 71 has higher oxygen abundance compared to the other \HII regions in the galaxy, contrary to the previous indirect estimates suggesting flat gradient throughout the galaxy. Together with the localized spatial variations of metallicity in the area, it is indicative of metal enrichment by the outflow from the super star cluster in the centre of Mrk 71.

 - **Abstract**
 Cometary impacts have been invoked as an atmosphere-independent method of stockpiling hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a key prebiotic feedstock molecule, into environments favourable for the onset of prebiotic chemistry on the early Earth. This work revisits the prospects for cometary delivery of HCN through new impacts simulations of idealised cometary bodies using the shock physics code iSALE combined with simple chemical modelling. Using temperature and pressure profiles for material within spherical, non-porous comets with a high resolution of Lagrangian tracer particles, we assess the survival rate of HCN across a range of impact velocities, sizes and angles, assuming both steady state and equilibrium chemistry. We find that HCN survival is extremely limited at impact velocities above the escape velocity of the Earth, unless the impact occurs at extreme obliquity ($\theta \sim 15^\circ$). We present a parametrisation of the survival of HCN as a function of impact velocity, angle, and cometary diameter, which provides an upper limit to survival in more realistic scenarios to aid with future studies investigating the role of comets in the origins of life. Although successful HCN delivery may be possible in our idealised model, we neglect to consider the effect of atmospheric passage and our results suggest that delivery alone is not likely to be sufficient for the onset of prebiotic chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceAct telescopes are Imaging Air Cherenkov telescopes installed as part of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the geographic South Pole. They consist of a 61 pixel camera and are small and robust to withstand the harsh environmental conditions. IceAct detects Cherenkov light produced by cosmic-ray particles with energies above approximately 10\,TeV interacting inside the atmosphere, which is complementary to the measurement of the air shower at the surface by IceTop and the high-energy muons in the deep ice. Two telescopes have been taking data since 2019 with a conservative estimated duty cycle of around 10\%. A graph neural network is used to reconstruct the basic air shower properties, like geometry and primary energy. This work focuses on the current progress in analyzing the energy spectrum of cosmic rays using IceAct data.
#### The THESAN-ZOOM project: Mystery N/O more -- uncovering the origin of peculiar chemical abundances and a not-so-fundamental metallicity relation at $3<z<12$

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of metallicities and chemical abundances at $3<z<12$ in the THESAN-ZOOM simulations. We find that smoothly curved gas-phase and stellar mass-metallicity relations (MZR) are already in place at $z\approx12$ and evolve slowly ($\sim$0.2 dex increase for gas, $\sim$0.4 dex increase for stars at a fixed stellar mass) down to $z=3$, governed largely by the efficiency with which galaxies retain their metals, rather than gas fraction. The canonical fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) survives in stars but breaks down and inverts for gas in low-mass galaxies ($M_\ast\lesssim10^{9}\mathrm{M_\odot}$) due to regular dilution by low-metallicity gas inflow. We find broad agreement of gas-phase N/O, Fe/O, and C/O with high-redshift observations, including the presence of nitrogen-rich galaxies (NRGs; $\log(\mathrm{N/O})>-0.6$) without the need for exotic yields in our chemical network. Instead, bursty star formation naturally generates order-of-magnitude excursions in N/O on $\lesssim$100 Myr timescales due to temporally differential galactic winds; after a starburst, stellar feedback expels gas, leaving a large population of asymptotic-giant-branch stars to dominate the enrichment of the relatively low-mass interstellar medium. NRGs lie below the main sequence and typically exhibit $\mathrm{EW}[H$\beta$]\lesssim40$ Å, in apparent tension with observed high-EW NRGs. This tension is reconciled if observed NRGs are in the initial stages of a subsequent starburst, illuminating previously enriched gas, which is supported by the finding of high SFR surface density nitrogen-rich giant molecular clouds.
#### Triggering and quenching in the shadow of AGN: How does AGN proximity affect star formation in the EAGLE simulation?

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most energetic phenomena in the universe, capable of regulating star formation in galaxies via radiative and mechanical feedback. While AGN feedback is well studied in host galaxies, its influence on neighbouring galaxies within the same large-scale environment remains less understood. In this work, we use the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to examine how proximity to AGN affects star formation in nearby star-forming galaxies (SFGs) out to 2 Mpc. A control sample matched in stellar mass and local density allows us to isolate AGN-driven environmental effects, quantified through the $\Delta$SFR offset defined as the difference between a galaxy's star formation rate (SFR) and that of its matched controls. We find a significant and mass-dependent impact where $61\%$ of AGN-adjacent SFGs show suppressed star formation, while $39\%$ exhibit enhancement. Although the overall magnitude of these offsets is modest, the trends are statistically robust and consistent across the population. Suppression is prevalent in massive, gas-poor galaxies in high-mass halos, consistent with thermal feedback inhibiting gas cooling. Enhanced SFRs appear in low-mass, gas-rich galaxies, suggesting AGN-driven compression may locally trigger star formation. These trends emerge despite EAGLE implementing AGN feedback as a single-mode, stochastic thermal process, indicating that such models can reproduce both quenching and triggering regimes. Our findings demonstrate that AGN feedback extends well beyond host galaxies, impacting neighbouring systems in a non-uniform, distance-, mass-, and gas-dependent manner. This non-local AGN influence represents a critical, yet often overlooked, mechanism in shaping galaxy evolution within large-scale structures, bridging high-energy astrophysical processes and cosmic-scale environmental regulation.
