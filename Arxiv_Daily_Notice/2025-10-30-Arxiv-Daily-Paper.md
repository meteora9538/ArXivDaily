#### The dwarf stellar mass function in different environments and the lack of a generic missing dwarfs problem in ΛCDM

 - **Abstract**
 We combine deep photometric data in the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields with high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to explore two key questions: (1) how does the galaxy stellar mass function, particularly in the dwarf (Mstar < 10^9.5 MSun ) regime, vary with environment, defined as distance from the large-scale structure (LSS) traced by nodes and filaments in the cosmic web? (2) is there a generic 'missing dwarfs' problem in LambdaCDM predictions when all environments - and not just satellites around Milky Way like galaxies - are considered? The depth of the observational data used here enables us to construct complete, unbiased samples of galaxies, down to Mstar ~ 10^7 MSun and out to z ~ 0.4. Strong environmental differences are found for the galaxy stellar mass function when considering distance from LSS. As we move closer to LSS, the dwarf mass function becomes progressively flatter and the knee of the mass function shifts to larger stellar masses, both of which result in a higher ratio of massive to dwarf galaxies. While the stellar mass functions from the three simulations (NewHorizon, TNG50 and FIREbox) considered here do not completely agree across the dwarf regime, there is no evidence of a generic missing dwarfs problem in the context of LambdaCDM, akin to the results of recent work that demonstrates that there is no missing satellites problem around Galactic analogues.

 - **Abstract**
 This study of the M81 complex and its Hubble flow delivers new and improved Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB)-based distances for nine member galaxies, yielding a total of 58 galaxies with high-precision TRGB distances. With those, we perform a systematic analysis of the group's dynamics in the core and its embedding in the local cosmic environment. Our analysis confirms that the satellite galaxies of the M81 complex exhibit a flattened, planar distribution almost perpendicular to the supergalactic pole and thus aligned with a larger-scale filamentary structure in the Local Universe. We demonstrate that the properties of the group's barycentre are robustly constrained by the two brightest members, M81 and M82, and that correcting heliocentric velocities for the solar motion in the Local Group decreases the velocity dispersion of the group. Then applying minor and major infall models, we fit the local Hubble flow to constrain the Hubble Constant and the total mass of the M81 complex. The joint best-fit parameters from both models yield $H_0 = \left(63 \pm 6 \right)$ km/s/Mpc and total mass of $(2.28\pm 0.49) \times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. We thus arrive at an increased mass estimate compared to prior work but reach a higher consistency with virial, $(2.74 \pm 0.36)\times 10^{12}\,M_\odot$, and projected-mass estimates, $(3.11 \pm 0.69)\times 10^{12} M_\odot$. Moreover, our $H_0$ estimate shows an agreement with Planck, consistent with other TRGB-based Local-Universe inferences of $H_0$ and still within a 2-$\sigma$ agreement with Cepheid-based Local-Universe probes.

 - **Abstract**
 The diminishing of star formation is accompanied by size differentiating, as quiescent galaxies are more compact than star-forming galaxies at fixed stellar mass. In order to understand how galaxy quenching is related to galaxy sizes, we performed a demographic study of 46 massive quiescent central galaxies with stellar mass from $10^{10.5}\rm M_\odot$ to $10^{11}\rm M_\odot$ in the TNG50 simulation. We found that, in addition to the triggering active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, galaxy size is also a major determinant of the quenching process, as small and compact galaxies are immediately quenched by the kinetic AGN feedback, while galaxies with large sizes are still active until strangulated by the cutoff of new gas replenishment. Further spatially resolved inspection reveals that this short and intense kinetic AGN feedback can only suppress the star formation within 1-2 kpc, resulting in this size-dependent effect of quenching. We also identify a long-term effect of a few Gyr timescale that the gas inflow rate is progressively suppressed after triggering kinetic feedback, which appears to effectively quench large galaxies entirely. We conclude that kinetic AGN feedback has two key roles in quenching: a short-term, intense effect that quenches the central 2 kpc region, and a long-term effect that suppresses the gas inflow rate and further quenches the entire galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Thanks to new advances in astronomical imaging, we can now routinely explore disk galaxy profiles about two magnitudes deeper than the data available 20 years ago. In this regard, it is an opportune time to reevaluate the past classifications of different surface brightness Types. In this paper, we explore the stellar mass profiles of a sample of disk galaxies with similar stellar masses ($\sim$10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) using IAC Stripe82 Legacy Project data. We find that Type I, II-CT, and III-d galaxies exhibit edges at surface brightnesses $\mu_g$(R$_{edge}$)$\sim$26.5 mag/arcsec$^2$ and surface mass densities $\Sigma$(R$_{edge}$)$\sim$0.5-1 M$_{\odot}$/pc$^2$. These surface brightnesses were outside the range of typical SDSS images and, therefore, unstudied. The present data suggest (although the statistics are inconclusive) that the main difference between the previous profile Types is the presence of either a more or a less intense bulge. Half of the Type II-CT galaxies are Sc, whereas half of the Type III-d galaxies are Sb. Finally, Type III-d galaxies have low mass surface density disks ($\Sigma$($\Delta$ $R_{\mathrm{exp}}$)$\sim$0.5 M$_{\odot}$/pc$^2$) and are bluer $(g-r)_0$=0.32$\pm$0.02 than the other Types ($(g-r)_0$=0.42$\pm$0.02 for Type I and II-CT), suggesting that their disks probably formed later in time.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova (SN) 1987A, with its long-rising ($\gtrsim$40~days) light curve, defines a rare subclass of type II SNe known as 1987A-like events. Representing only $\sim$1-3\% of all core-collapse SNe and often found in low-metallicity environments, their large diversity suggests a wide range of progenitor and explosion properties. This study aims to improve the understanding of 1987A-like SNe by characterizing their explosion parameters, including kinetic energy, ejected mass, progenitor radius at explosion, and synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass. Additionally, it seeks to identify systematic trends in both the physical properties and the observed features of these peculiar events. A new Bayesian parameter estimation method, based on our $^{56}$Ni-dependent analytical model for hydrogen-rich SNe, is applied to derive explosion parameters from the light curves and expansion velocities of one of the largest and most comprehensive 1987A-like SN samples to date. These data are measured through a consistent analysis of observations available in the literature. The analysis reveals a heterogeneous population that nevertheless clusters into two main groups: (i) lower-energy explosions with modest $^{56}$Ni yields ($\sim$0.07~M$_\odot$), similar to SN~1987A, and (ii) more energetic events (up to $\sim$5~foe) with larger nickel production and, in some cases, unusually extended progenitors. We confirm a robust correlation between $^{56}$Ni mass, peak luminosity, and explosion energy, as well as between ejecta mass and recombination timescale. An anti-correlation between Ba~II line strength and photospheric velocity indicates that stronger Ba~II absorptions in 1987A-like SNe arise from more compact, slowly expanding ejecta. Our study underscores the need to extend analytical frameworks to include additional power sources, enabling scalable and accurate modelling of the growing number of peculiar transients.

 - **Abstract**
 At low redshift, massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) are most frequently found in massive, rich galaxy clusters, but at high redshift the trend is less clear. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence of the effects of environment on the formation and assembly of high-redshift MQGs. We identify 25 (5) $\log (M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}\geq10.5$ ($10.0\leq\log (M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}<10.5$) spectroscopically-confirmed quiescent galaxies in the UDS and EGS fields at $3<z<5$ with NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from RUBIES and other public JWST NIRSpec programs. We measure the density contrast in these fields by applying a Monte Carlo Voronoi Tesselation density mapping technique to photometric and spectroscopic redshifts of $m_\mathrm{F444W}<27.5$ sources. We robustly detect 12 massive overdense peaks with $\log (M_\mathrm{Peak}/\mathrm{M_\odot})\geq13$ and six extended massive protoclusters ($\log (M_\mathrm{Struct}/\mathrm{M_\odot})\geq13.85$). We observe that MQGs are preferentially found in these massive peaks and within these massive structures: $\approx50\%$ of MQGs are found in massive peaks, compared to $\approx20\%$ of massive star forming galaxies (MSFGs) and $\approx15\%$ of the overall spectroscopically-confirmed population. We also find an apparent dependence on both quiescent galaxy mass and environment, with $75\%$ of the most massive ($\log (M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}\geq10.75$) residing inside overdense peaks. We compare the star formation histories (SFHs) of the MQGs with the high-redshift galaxy stellar mass function from observations and simulated quiescent galaxies at $z>5$, finding that the masses from the inferred MQG SFHs regularly exceed either observed or simulated high-redshift galaxies, which suggests indicates that mergers and ex-situ star formation play a key role in the mass assembly of MQGs in overdense environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the magnetic field orientation and strength in the massive star-forming region G35.20-0.74N (G35), using polarized dust emission data obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) as part of the Magnetic fields in Massive star-forming Regions (MagMaR) survey. The G35 region shows a filamentary structure (a length of $\sim$0.1 pc) with six bright cores located along the filament's long axis. Magnetic field strengths across the G35 region range from 0.2 to 4.4 mG with a mean value of 0.8 $\pm$ 0.4 mG. The mass-to-flux ratio ($\lambda$) varies from 0.1 to 6.0 the critical value. The highest values are found locally around cores, whereas the remains of the filament are subcritical. A H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (3--2) velocity gradient of 29 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ is evident along the filament's long axis, aligned with the magnetic field direction. At larger scales ($\sim$0.1 pc), the magnetic field lines appear roughly perpendicular to the filament's long axis, in contrast to the smaller-scale structure ($\sim$0.003 pc) traced by ALMA. The magnetic field lines could be dragged along the filament as a result of the gas motion induced by the gravitational potential of the filament. Six cores in the filament have similar spacings between 0.02--0.04 pc. The initial filament fragmentation could have produced a core spacing of 0.06 pc, following filament fragmentation theory, and the current core spacing is the result of cores comoving with the gas along the filament. This core migration could occur in a few 10$^4$ years, consistent with high-mass star formation time scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion near black holes (BHs) is multidimensional, with turbulence, resistivity, thermal transport, and dust dynamics all playing essential roles. In cold accretion discs (ADs) or the region of an AD where magnetic fields (MFs) are negligible (or absent), hydrodynamic (HD) turbulence is probably dominating. However, Magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is the primary cause of turbulence in ADs. Significant velocity variations and rapid pressure changes are characteristics of turbulent flows, which allow better mixing and more angular momentum (AM) and energy transfer. Also, in accretion flow (AF), the interaction between turbulence and resistivity determines the efficiency of energy dissipation and heat transfer. Radiation, convection, and thermal conduction (TC) are the heat transport modes existing in AFs, where TC enables energy transfer in accreting materials via heat flux. Moreover, convection, also generated by turbulence, significantly impacts the stability of the AD and its vertical structure. The disc may be affected by radiation from the AD surrounding the BH when X-ray emission occurs. The emission from the disc is also affected by dust particles. Dust grains near BH are exposed to high temperatures and intense radiation, which might affect the flow characteristics, as seen in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This chapter highlights the combined effect of turbulence, resistivity, transport mechanisms, and dust particles on BH AF. Future studies in this field must thoroughly investigate how dust, transport mechanisms, and turbulence interact in the BH accretion system.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational studies of HII region-molecular cloud interactions constrain models of feedback and quantify its impact on the surrounding environment. A recent hypothesis proposes that a characteristic spectral signature in ground state hyperfine lines of hydroxyl (OH) -- the OH flip -- may trace gas that is dynamically interacting with an expanding HII region, offering a new means of probing such interactions. We explore this hypothesis using dedicated Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of three Galactic HII regions, G049.205$-$0.343, G034.256+0.145 and G024.471+0.492, in 1--2 GHz continuum emission, all four 18-cm ground-state OH lines, and multiple hydrogen radio recombination lines. A Gaussian decomposition of the molecular gas data reveals complex OH emission and absorption across our targets. We detect the OH flip towards two of our sources, G049.205$-$0.343 and G034.256+0.145, finding agreement between key predictions of flip hypothesis and the observed multi-wavelength spectra, kinematics and morphology. Specifically, we demonstrate a strong spatial and kinematic association between the OH flip and the ionized gas of the HII regions -- the first time this has been demonstrated for resolved sources -- and evidence from $^{13}$CO(1--0) data that the expected OH component originates from the non-disturbed gas of the parent cloud. While we detect no flip in G024.471+0.492, we do find evidence of interacting molecular gas traced by OH, providing further support for OH's ability to trace HII region-molecular cloud interactions.
#### Exploring the Origin of Rejuvenating Gas from MaNGA Nearby Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the origin of gas fueling secondary star formation, i.e., rejuvenation in nearby galaxies. From the MaNGA IFU survey, we use stellar absorption features D$_n$4000 and H$\delta_A$ to identify regions that started the rejuvenation within the last $\sim$200~Myr. We compare the gas-phase metallicity, metallicity gradients, environments, and H\Romannum{1} gas fractions of the rejuvenating galaxies (RJGs) to controlled star-forming and quiescent galaxy samples. We demonstrate that, for the majority of RJGs, the rejuvenating gas is originally in the galaxy rather than accreted gas. The evidence includes: (1) gas metallicities consistent with the mass-metallicity relation of SF galaxies; (2) metallicity gradients that are not flattened, arguing against radial inflows; (3) gas velocities in rejuvenating regions consistent with their surroundings, and (4) high H\Romannum{1} gas fractions comparable to SF galaxies, indicating a pre-existing reservoir. Furthermore, we find no evidence that the rejuvenating events are triggered by tidal interactions with neighbors. While internal processes appear to dominate, we also present a clear example of rejuvenation triggered by gas accretion. The galaxy MaNGA 12080-12705 hosts a low-metallicity, kinematically distinct star-forming region in an overall old, massive galaxy, providing unambiguous evidence of an external origin, such as accretion or a minor merger. Our analysis demonstrates that using D$_n$4000 and EW(H$\delta_A$) provides a reliable way to identify current rejuvenation events in large spectroscopic surveys. The method will enable statistical studies to understand rejuvenation across cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 Circumbinary configurations offer a test of planet formation in an altered environment, where the inner binary has perturbed a protoplanetary disc. Comparisons of the physical and orbital parameters between the circumbinary planet population and the population of exoplanets orbiting single stars will reveal how these disc perturbations affect the assembly of planets. Circumbinary exoplanets detected thus far typically have masses $< 3 \,\rm M_{jup}$ raising the question of whether high-mass circumbinary planets are possible, and also whether population features such as the brown dwarf desert would appear in circumbinary configurations like for single star systems. Here, we report observations taken with the SOPHIE high-resolution spectrograph. These observations reveal an $m_{\rm b}\,\sin i_{\rm b} = 20.9 \,\rm M_{jup}$ outer companion, on an eccentric ($e = 0.43$), $1800\,\rm d$ orbit, which we call BEBOP-4 (AB) b. Using dynamical arguments we constrain the true mass $m_{\rm b}< 26.3 \,\rm M_{jup}$. The inner binary's two eclipsing stellar components have masses $M_{\rm A} = 1.51\,\rm M_\odot$, and $M_{\rm B} = 0.46\,\rm M_\odot$. Their orbital period is $72\,\rm d$, and their eccentricity is $0.27$. This system contains the longest period binary surveyed by the BEBOP project. BEBOP-4b is expected to be detectable using Gaia DR4 single epoch astrometric measurements. Despite a large period ratio of $\sim 25:1$, the substantial eccentricities of both orbits mean that the outer orbit is on the edge of orbital stability, and located in between two destabilising secular resonances. Should the outer companion survive, the BEBOP-4 system appears like a precursor to several post-common envelope binaries exhibiting eclipse timing variations where very massive circumbinary companions have been proposed.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have begun to reveal a surprising morphological diversity in galaxies within the first billion years after the Big Bang, including indications of structural maturity previously thought to arise much later. These findings raise fundamental questions about when and how well-known structural components of galaxy morphology, such as bulges and disks, first emerged. However, directly identifying and resolving such structures at z $>$ 6 remains challenging due to limited spatial resolution and sensitivity. In this work, we present a clear and robust morphological analysis of a sample of 190 galaxies at z $>=$ 6, demonstrating that distinct bulge and disk components were already beginning to emerge during this early epoch. Using multi-component light profile fitting, we model the radial brightness distributions of a subset (20) of galaxies with an inner spheroidal (Sersic) component and an underlying exponential disk. These systems exhibit high bulge-to-total (B/T) light ratios (~ 0.47) and central stellar mass surface densities (~ 2.82*10$^{8}$ M$_{sun}$ kpc$^{-2}$ ) - values close to those of nearby quiescent galaxies. Combined with their intense central star formation rate surface densities (~ 1.26*10$^{1}$ M$_{sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ ), our results indicate a rapid building of inner stellar mass and bulge assembly within these young systems. We propose that these early bulge-disk galaxies represent progenitors of massive star-forming and quiescent systems observed at lower redshifts. Their subsequent evolution may proceed through physical processes such as disk growth, compaction, quenching, or bulge-disk co-evolution, driven by both internal dynamics and external interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistical framework that establishes an accelerating star formation scenario for dense clumps using ATLASGAL and ALMAGAL samples. By employing the cumulative distribution function of dust temperature as a monotonic evolutionary indicator, we linearize clump evolution into a normalized timescale, enabling direct comparison across different samples. The virial mass of clumps increases exponentially with this normalized time, revealing an accelerating buildup of star-forming gas within protoclusters. The evolution of the maximum core mass further shows that the growth timescales of protoclusters and their embedded most massive protostars are comparable, implying a self-similar acceleration of star formation from the stellar to the protocluster scale. This unified framework naturally reproduces the observed evolution of luminosity, the core mass function, the mass growth of the most massive protostars, and the dense gas star formation law on clump scales, establishing a coherent picture of accelerating star formation across scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of 900 ks high-resolution RGS XMM-Newton observations of the nearby Seyfert galaxy Mrk 509 with the use of a self-consistent warm absorber (WA) model. We perform a physically motivated approach to the modeling of WA as a stratified medium in constant total pressure (CTP) regime. Powerful outflows are fundamental ingredients of any active galactic nuclei (AGN) structure. They may significantly affect the cosmological environment of their host galaxy. High-resolution X-ray data are best suited for outflow's studies, and the observed absorption lines on heavy elements are evidence of the physical properties of an absorbing gas. Our models allow us to fit continuum shapes bounded together with the line profiles, which gives additional constraints on the gas structure of WA in this source. In this work, we benchmark and test the CTP model on the soft X-ray spectrum of Mrk 509. A grid of synthetic absorbed spectra was computed with the photoionization code Titan assuming that the system was under CTP. As an illuminating spectral energy distribution (SED), we used the most actual multiwavelength observations available for Mrk 509. We apply these models to the high-resolution spectrum of the WA in the Mrk 509, taking into account cold/warm/hot Galactic absorption on the way to the observer. CTP gas with $\log \xi_{0} \sim 1.9$, defined on the cloud surface, fits the data well. A higher ionization component is needed for Ne X absorption. The best-fit model is optically thin with $\log N_{\rm H }= 20.456 \pm 0.016$. The lines are non-saturated, and the CTP spectral fit aligns with previous analyses of Mrk 509 with a constant density WA. The model constrains the gas density, placing the WA cloud at 0.02 pc, consistent with the inner broad line region and the thickening region of the accretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The scope of this paper is focused on the question if gas is transported to dense clumps inside high-mass star-forming regions through filamentary structures on a scale of several parsecs to the sub-parsec scale. We quantify the gas flows from a scale of up to several parsecs down to the sub-parsec scale along filamentary structures. In this work the accretion flow mechanisms based on gas kinematic data in the three high-mass star-forming regions G75.78, IRAS21078+5211 and NGC7538 are studied with data obtained from the IRAM 30 m telescope. The analysis is carried out using the surface density derived from 1.2 mm continuum emission and velocity differences estimated from HCO+ and H13CO+ molecular line data.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal dissipation in star-planet systems occurs through various mechanisms, including the precessional instability. This is an instability of laminar flows (``Poincaré flows") forced by axial precession of a rotating, oblate, spin-orbit misaligned fluid planet or star, which excites inertial waves in convective regions if the dimensionless precession rate (``Poincaré number" $\mathrm{Po}$) is sufficiently large. We constrain the contribution of the precessional instability to tidal dissipation and heat transport, using Cartesian hydrodynamical simulations in a small patch of a planet, and study its interaction with turbulent convection, modelled as rotating Rayleigh-Bénard convection. The precessional instability without convection results in laminar flow at low values and turbulent flow at sufficiently high values of $\mathrm{Po}$. The associated tidal dissipation rate scales as $\mathrm{Po}^2$ and $\mathrm{Po}^3$ in each regime, respectively. With convection, the Poincaré number at which turbulent flow is achieved shifts to lower values for stronger convective driving. Convective motions also act on large-scale tidal flows like an effective viscosity, resulting in continuous tidal dissipation (scaling as $\mathrm{Po}^2$), which obfuscates or suppresses tidal dissipation due to precessional instability. The effective viscosities obtained agree with scaling laws previously derived using (rotating) mixing-length theory. By evaluating our scaling laws using interior models of Hot Jupiters, we find that the precessional instability is significantly more efficient than the effective viscosity of convection. The former drives alignment in 1 Gyr for a Jupiter-like planet orbiting within 23 days. Linearly excited inertial waves can be even more effective for wider orbits, aligning spins for orbits within 53-142 days.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the properties of extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at $z=4-9$ and their role in reionization. Compact, low-mass galaxies with intense optical emission lines are linked to elevated specific star formation rates (sSFRs) and recent bursts of star formation. Feedback in these systems may enable the leakage of ionizing radiation into the intergalactic medium. Using JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the CAPERS, CEERS, and RUBIES surveys, we compile 160 NIRCam-selected EELGs in the EGS field. These galaxies show extreme rest-frame equivalent widths (EWs), with a median EW([O III]+H${\beta}$)=1616Å and EW(H${\alpha}$)=763Å. They are low-mass (median log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$)=8.26) with high sSFRs (median 43 Gyr$^{-1}$), above the $z\sim6$ main sequence. UV slopes are diverse, with a mean $\beta=-2.0$, and only 7% have extremely blue continua ($\beta<-2.6$). Emission-line diagnostics suggest stellar populations as the primary ionizing source, although an AGN fraction of 14% is found. These galaxies are efficient ionizing photon producers, with mean log($\xi_{\rm ion}$ [Hz erg$^{-1}$])=25.34, exceeding typical values at similar redshifts. Escape fractions, however, are heterogeneous: 9% of EELGs show escape fractions $>$10% for both Ly${\alpha}$ and LyC photons, while 82% lack detectable Ly${\alpha}$ emission. The median inferred LyC escape fraction is modest (4.4%) but enhanced in super-Eddington systems with sSFR >25 Gyr$^{-1}$. The galaxies are extremely compact, with a median effective radius of 0.49 kpc, and exhibit a recent star-formation burst. Our analysis indicates that sSFR and star-formation rate surface density are the primary drivers of their extreme emission line strengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Powerful, large-scale relativistic jets are usually associated with massive, old elliptical galaxies. This paradigm has recently been challenged by the identification of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies, thought to be young active galactic nuclei with low-mass black holes, harboring relativistic jets. Among them, sources hosting $>$100 kpc radio jets are extremely rare. Here, we report the discovery of large-scale, double-lobed radio structures in 33 NLSy1s with the projected linear size of at least 100 kpc from a recently published catalog of 22656 NLSy1 galaxies. These 33 include 29 confirmed double-lobed sources and 4 candidates whose radio structure requires further study. We suggest that their low black hole masses are unlikely to be due to their small angles of inclination to the line of sight. These enigmatic sources were identified by examining the radio observations taken with the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters, Very Large Array Sky Survey, Low Frequency Array, and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey. Among them, the NLSy1 source J1318+2626 ($z=0.62$) is found to host a radio jet with the projected linear size of 4.3 Mpc, making it the only NLSy1 galaxy hosting a Mpc-scale radio jet known as of today. We conclude that future observations of NLSy1 sources with the next generation of sensitive telescopes may reveal a much larger population harboring large-scale jets, thus providing crucial clues on their origin, propagation, and interaction with the ambient environment.
#### Engulfment of a hot Jupiter as a possible origin of the rapid spin and internal spin misalignment of the planet-hosting red giant Kepler-56

 - **Abstract**
 A recent asteroseismic analysis suggests that Kepler-56 -- a planet-hosting red giant -- exhibits a unique spin structure: (1) the spin axes of the core and envelope are misaligned; and (2) the envelope rotates approximately an order of magnitude faster than typical red giants. In this paper, we investigate a feasible scenario to reproduce this spin structure by estimating the amount of the angular momentum (AM) supply from the planets through the simplified calculation of the time evolution of AM. As a result, unless the tidal efficiency is extremely high, we show that the tidal interactions between the known close-in planets (Kepler-56 b and c) are insufficient to supply the AM required to accelerate Kepler-56 from the spin rate observed in typical red giants. We also show that the engulfment of a hot Jupiter can be expected to provide sufficient AM supply for the acceleration ant that the mass and orbit of the engulfed hot Jupiter are constrained by a mass of 0.5-2 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 1-6 days. On the other hand, if Kepler 56 was already rapidly spinning before entering the RG stage and requires no acceleration, the obliquity damping by the known close-in planets can reproduce the spin structure of Kepler-56. Even in such cases, planetary engulfment during the MS stage might be involved in achieving rapid spin before the tidal alignment. These discussions demonstrate the importance of Kepler-56 as a candidate for planetary engulfment that may leave traces of its spin structure.

 - **Abstract**
 We present analysis of JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of the galaxy SXDF-NB1006-2 at $z = 7.212$, as part of the Reionization and the ISM/Stellar Origins with JWST and ALMA (RIOJA) project. We derive the physical properties by conducting spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, revealing that our target is a young (age $\sim2$ Myr) starburst galaxy with intense radiation field. We detect multiple nebular emission lines from NIRSpec IFS data. We identify a robust broad component of [O III]$\lambda5008$ emission, indicating the presence of ionized gas outflows. The derived gas depletion time of a few hundred Myr implies that our target could be one of the progenitors of massive quiescent galaxies at $z\sim4-5$ identified by recent JWST observations. The spatial distribution of optical and far-infrared (FIR) [O III] emission lines differs in morphology, likely resulting from different critical densities and inhomogeneous density distributions within the galaxy. Potential old stellar populations may be necessary to account for the derived metallicity of $\sim0.2\,\rm{Z}_\odot$, and their presence can be confirmed by future MIRI observations. Including our target, star-forming galaxies at $z>6$ detected by ALMA are generally very young but more massive and brighter in UV than galaxies identified by only JWST. The ALMA-detected galaxies may also have a steeper mass-metallicity relation. These findings suggest that the ALMA-detected galaxies may have experienced more efficient mass assembly processes in their evolutionary pathways.
