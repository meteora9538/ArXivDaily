 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of gravitational-wave (GW) recoil on the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe. Forming ~10^9 Msun SMBHs by z ~ 6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model (Sassano et al. 2021) by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli et al. 2007; Lousto et al. 2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Pop III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by ~20-30% by z = 6 and creates a population of off-nuclear ("wandering") BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets ~0.1 arcsec and line-of-sight velocity shifts ~10^2-10^3 km/s in a few percent of high-z quasars. All code is publicly available at this https URL

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123 is the most massive binary black hole (BBH) merger detected to date by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. With at least one black hole (BH) in the upper-mass gap and both BHs exhibiting high spins ($\chi_{1,2} \gtrsim 0.8$), this event challenges standard isolated binary evolution models. A compelling alternative is a dynamical origin in star clusters, where stellar binaries and hierarchical mergers may both contribute to the formation of similar BBHs. In this work, we investigate the formation of GW231123-like events in different cluster environments using the B-POP semi-analytic population synthesis code. We find that low-metallicity environments ($Z \lesssim 0.002$) are ideal for producing BBH mergers similar to GW231123. In young and globular clusters, these BBHs have components formed in stellar binaries, whilst in nuclear clusters there is also a significant contribution from BHs built-up via hierarchical mergers. Natal spins of BHs formed in stellar binaries are crucial to find GW231123 analogs. In particular, our models suggest that BHs from stellar binaries are likely characterized by high-spins. Simulated GW231123-like systems exhibit short delay times, $t_\mathrm{del} \sim 0.1 - 1$ Gyr, which suggests their progenitors formed close to the inferred merger redshift ($z = 0.39^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$). We argue that star clusters in metal-poor dwarf galaxies or Milky Way-like galaxies are ideal nurseries, inferring an upper limit to the local merger rate of $\mathcal{R} \sim 1.6\times10^{-3} - 0.16$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ for nuclear clusters, $\sim 0.036 - 0.72$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ for globular clusters, and $4\times10^{-4}-0.041$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ for young clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy clusters are among the largest and densest structures in the Universe. Their high density generally increases the suppression of star formation, known as quenching, altering galaxy properties. We study the quenching of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) in the rich cluster ZwCl 0024.0+1652 (Cl0024) at redshift $z\sim0.4$, aiming to determine if and how star formation is suppressed. Using multi-object spectroscopy from the GLACE survey, we extracted fluxes and redshifts of [O II]$\lambda\lambda3727,3729$, $\mathrm{H\beta}$, and [O III]$\lambda5007$ emission lines to derive star formation rates (SFRs) for 173 ELGs. We also performed spectral energy distribution fitting to obtain key evolutionary parameters such as stellar masses ($M_\star$) and the 4000 Å break ($D4000$) index. We derived the $M_\star-\mathrm{SFR}$ relation for 98 star-forming galaxies (SFGs), finding 34.7% exhibit suppressed SFRs in the cluster, compared to 11.0% in the field. While the SFRs show no significant variation with local density, the fraction of SFGs is 1.55 times higher in the cluster outskirts than in intermediate-density regions. The specific SFR decreases strongly with $D4000$ for active SFGs but remains constant for suppressed galaxies. The fraction of suppressed galaxies in the infall region is 2.6 times higher than in the core, especially in the infalling structure B of the cluster. The cluster's total mass does not appear to be a key factor in SFG quenching. Star formation in Cl0024 galaxies is suppressed by the dense cluster environment. This suppression is evident in SFG fractions and parameters tracing long-term evolution, indicating prolonged quenching. The SFGs preferentially reside in low-density regions, while suppressed galaxies dominate the infall region, supporting a 'delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario.
#### Radiation GRMHD Models of Accretion onto Stellar-Mass Black Holes: II. Super-Eddington Accretion

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of super-Eddington black hole accretion simulations that solve the GRMHD equations coupled with angle-discretized radiation transport. The simulations span a range of accretion rates, two black hole spins, and two magnetic field topologies, and include resolution studies as well as comparisons with non-radiative models. Super-Eddington accretion flows consistently develop geometrically thick disks supported by radiation pressure, regardless of magnetic field configuration. Radiation generated in the inner disk drives substantial outflows, forming conical funnel regions that limit photon escape and result in very low radiation efficiency. The accretion flows are highly turbulent with thermal energy transport dominated by radiation advection rather than diffusion. Angular momentum is primarily carried outward by Maxwell stress, with turbulent Reynolds stress playing a subdominant role. Both strong and weak jets are produced. Strong jets arise from sufficient net vertical magnetic flux and rapid black hole spin and can effectively evacuate the funnel, enabling radiation to escape through strong geometric beaming. In contrast, weak jets fail to clear the funnel, which becomes obscured by radiation-driven outflows and leads to distinct observational signatures. Spiral structures are observed in the plunging region, behaving like density waves. These super-Eddington models are applicable to a variety of astronomical systems, including ultraluminous X-ray sources, little red dots, and black hole transients.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope show that nearby spiral galaxies are dominated by the presence of H I and H II bubbles that strongly shape their surrounding medium. These bubbles result from the feedback of high-mass stars at different stages of their life cycle. However, early (pre-supernova) feedback from high-mass stars is still poorly quantified. Recent results from numerical simulations suggest that the impact of high-mass star early feedback (photoionization, wind) on star formation properties is complex, time-dependent, and strongly depends on physical conditions, including the magnetic field properties. In our Galaxy, ionized (H II) regions observed in different evolution stages show a high diversity of star formation in their associated photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). However, the way in which the low- to high-density interstellar medium evolves to this situation remains elusive. Quantifying the impact of early feedback from high-mass stars on star formation properties and star formation laws (star formation rate, star formation efficiency versus gas surface density, {\Sigma}gas) will allow for a better understanding of the evolution of star formation laws in external galaxies, the laws that are key ingredients of galaxy evolution models. PRIMA, with its high sensitivity, large mapping efficiency, and polarimetric capabilities, offers a unique opportunity to address the way radiative feedback and magnetic field control star formation in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 The Rosette Nebula is a well-known H II region shaped by the interaction of gas with the OB stars of the NGC 2244 stellar association. Located within the remnant of a giant molecular cloud, it exhibits a complex structure of ionized gas, molecular material, dust, and embedded clusters. In October 2023, the region was observed as part of the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM) integral field spectroscopy survey. Covering a radius of approximately 1 degree, the dataset comprises 33,326 spectra with spatially resolved information spanning 390 - 980 nm. We present a structural analysis of the ionized, molecular, and dusty components using multi-wavelength observations: optical spectroscopy from SDSS-V LVM, 12CO emission from PMO/MWISP (sub-millimeter), and dust emission from WISE (12 micron) and Herschel (far-infrared). These datasets were complemented with the positions of ionizing stars to study emission structures traced by H alpha, H beta, [O III], [N II], and [S II], as well as the spatial distribution of line ratios (H alpha/H beta, [O III]/H beta, [N II]/H alpha, and [S II]/H alpha) relative to the surrounding molecular cloud. Our analysis reveals interaction zones between ionized and neutral gas, including filaments, globules, and dense regions with or without ongoing star formation. Radial and quadrant-based flux profiles further highlight morphological and ionization variations, supporting the scenario in which the Rosette Nebula evolved from a non-homogeneous molecular cloud with a thin, sheet-like structure.

 - **Abstract**
 When black hole jets encounter ambient medium, they can compress the gas, trigger star formation, and create stellar clusters containing tens of thousands of stars. Here, we report a remarkable discovery of such a phenomenon that happened just 2.2 billion years after the Big Bang, during the Cosmic Noon era. Quasar SDSSJ141924.44+532315.5, powered by a one-billion-solar-mass black hole, is seen blasting a powerful jet that interacts with a hypermassive gas reservoir, creating a fascinating, clumpy, arc- like structure spanning over 250 kiloparsecs in projected length, consisting of at least eight clumps. Each clump contains billions of stars, is as massive as the Milky Way, and exhibits extreme levels of star formation. We interpret these findings as fragmentation of a cosmic filament triggered by a jet overpressurized expanding cocoon, which leads to the birth of protogalaxies, a process observed at scales never seen before. We find that the physical conditions within the filament are favorable for a fragmentation scenario to occur. We also discuss the survivability and evolution of individual clumps in the context of unsolved galaxy formation theory problems.

 - **Abstract**
 Microlensing is one of the most powerful tools for probing the nature of dark halo objects and the sources they lens. As our nearest massive galaxy, M31 provides a rich source population with many potential lenses in its halo crossing our field of view at any one time. In this paper we explore the probability that X-ray sources in M31 will be lensed by white dwarfs in M31's halo. We find an expected lensing rate of 2.6/year within the mean archival Swift XRT field-of-view, and 6.3/year for the whole galaxy. For X-ray emitting sources harboring accreting neutron stars and black holes, we find that microlensing offers a unique opportunity to constrain the properties of the inner accretion flow. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to recover both the spin of the black hole and the temperature profile of the accretion disk by discerning their effects upon the profile of the microlensing magnification. We show that these parameters have a significant effect on the shape of the light curve, with the effect of spin being more pronounced at smaller impact parameters and higher energies, while the effect of the temperature profile is larger at lower energies and larger impact parameters. This suggests that multi-band observations of a single lensing event could be used to robustly constrain both parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Early JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of high-redshift candidate massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 7$, and recent DESI measurements show a preference for dynamical dark energy, which together present a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In this work, we jointly analyze high-redshift galaxy data from JWST, baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI DR2, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT, measuring the total neutrino mass $\sum m_{\nu}$. We consider three dark energy models ($\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM) and three mass hierarchies. Our results indicate that in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, adding JWST data to CMB+DESI tightens the upper limit of $\sum m_{\nu}$ by about $5.8\%-10.2\%$, and we obtain $\sum m_{\nu} < 0.167~\mathrm{eV}$ ($2\sigma$) in the normal hierarchy (NH) case. Furthermore, JWST also offers indicative lower limits on star formation efficiency parameter of $f_{*,10} \gtrsim 0.146-0.161$. Bayesian evidence weakly favors the $w_0w_a$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model relative to the $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model using CMB+DESI+JWST data. These results suggest that the joint analysis of high-redshift JWST data and low-redshift DESI data provides compelling constraints on neutrino mass and merits further investigation.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. There remains much mystery about how or if wave-energy in the photosphere can be transferred sufficiently upwards through the solar atmosphere to contribute to coronal heating. In light of a plethora of theoretical and idealised studies, we must complement our understanding with realistic and self-driven simulations in order to confidently quantify such contributions. Aims. In this study we aim to connect the various environments from the photosphere to low corona and identify wave drivers, transitions and dissipation mechanisms. We will analyse the effects of the presence of twisted magnetic features and vortical flows on the transport of such wave modes as the structures evolve. Methods. We adopt the most significant frequency (MSF) decomposition method to trace wave activity through a 3D realistic quiet Sun simulation. We focus on vertical and temporal evolution, identifying wave sources and shifts in the dominant modes. Results. We identify two frequencies, at 3.5 and 5 mHz, that connect oscillations in the upper convection zone to the dynamics in the solar atmosphere. We see distinct differences in the absence and presence of swirling structures on the upwards propagation of these oscillations. Furthermore, we validate the use of the highest frequency MSFs as a proxy for the location of shocks in the chromosphere, and use the results to understand the connection between shocks and the propagation of oscillations in the upper atmosphere. We discuss the relation of energy transfer via shocks, mode conversion, and jets. Finally, we find the contribution of 3.5 and 5 mHz signals to the overall wave power in the domain to be significant, up to 50%.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the impact of cosmic web environments on galaxy properties such as $(u-r)\,$colour, stellar mass, star formation rate, and stellar metallicity, using a stellar mass-matched sample of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation. We use Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) to quantify correlations among galaxy properties and apply Student's t-test to assess the statistical significance of their differences across cosmic web environments. In every case, the null hypothesis is rejected at $> 99.99\%$ confidence, providing strong evidence that correlations among galaxy properties are strongly dependent on cosmic web environments.
#### The Orbits of Isolated Dwarfs in the Local Group from New 3D Kinematics: Constraints on First Infall, Backsplash, and Quenching Mechanisms

 - **Abstract**
 It is commonly supposed that quenched field dwarfs near the edge of the Local Group (LG) are backsplash galaxies, having previously orbited within the Milky Way (MW) or M31's virial radius, whereas galaxies on first infall should still have gas and star formation. We measured proper motions (PMs) for six dwarf galaxies located 400-1000 kpc from the MW using the Hubble Space Telescope. For four galaxies (Aquarius, Cetus, Pisces, Tucana), we report the first PMs. For the remaining two (Leo T and Pegasus), we measure PMs with order-of-magnitude improvement. We compute orbital histories to assess whether any of the six are backsplash galaxies. While some have non-zero likelihoods of past interaction with the MW or M31, these are weak and typically occur at large distances (e.g., $>$ 2Rvir). The properties of Aquarius, Leo T, Pisces, and Pegasus are consistent with first passage through a massive halo. Cetus, which shows a low probability (~4-6%) of interacting with the MW or M31 in the last 6 Gyr, is more likely a backsplash galaxy resulting from an interaction with M31 over 6 Gyr ago, in the same regime where rigid orbital models become less reliable. Tucana has been thought to be a backsplash galaxy, but our orbits indicate it cannot have interacted with a massive LG host. Our results highlight the diversity of evolutionary pathways for isolated, intermediate-mass dwarfs ($M_* \approx 10^5-10^7 M_{\odot}$) and the need to reassess quenching mechanisms beyond environmental interactions with massive hosts.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic breakout model explains a variety of solar eruptions, ranging from small-scale jets to large-scale coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Most of our previous studies are focused on jets and CMEs in single null-point topologies. Here, we investigate the initiation of CMEs and associated particle acceleration in a double null-point (or nested fan-spine) topology during multiple homologous M- and X-class flares from an active region. The initiation of the flare and associated eruption begins with inflow structures moving towards the inner null of the closed fan-spine topology. The first explosive breakout reconnection of the flux rope at the inner null produced a circular and remote ribbons along with successful eruption of the flux rope and associated fast EUV (shock) wave. Simultaneous flare reconnection beneath the erupting flux rope produced a typical two-ribbon flare along with two hard X-ray footpoint sources. When the flux rope (with shock) reaches the outer null, the second explosive breakout reconnection produces another large-scale remote ribbon. The radio observations reveal quasiperiodic Type III bursts (period=100-s) and a Type II burst during the breakout reconnection near the inner and outer nulls, along with gradual solar energetic particles (SEPs) observed at 1 AU for magnetically connected events. This study highlight the importance of two successive breakout reconnection in the initiation of CMEs in nested-null topologies and associated particle acceleration/release into the interplanetary medium. The particles are accelerated by the shock ahead of the flux rope, which formed during the inner breakout reconnection. These findings have significant implications for particle acceleration and escape processes in multi-scale null-point topologies that produce jets and CMEs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a survey of O VI line widths obtained from hydrodynamic simulations that model the mixing between High Velocity Clouds and the circumgalactic medium and track the non-equilibrium ionization populations of the ions. We run 10 simulations with various physical conditions of the clouds and ambient environments, so that our results can be compared to observations of various cloud environments. Synthetic spectra are created for the simulated sight lines that contain O VI. The range of our Doppler broadening parameter, $b$, is from $\sim$6 km s$^{-1}$ to $\sim$107 km s$^{-1}$. We calculate the thermal and non-thermal contributions to the $b$ values. Both $b$ and the thermal contribution to $b$ can be substantially less than the CIE value. These narrow line widths are due to the time delay in recombination from O VI to O V in mixing regions, which results in substantial amounts of O VI at temperatures below the 2.9 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ K CIE temperature. Our results show that non equilibrium collisional ionization and mixing can produce the narrow line widths that are seen in multiple observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Erupting flux ropes play crucial role in powering a wide range of solar transients, including flares, jets, and coronal mass ejections. These events are driven by the release of stored magnetic energy, facilitated by the shear in the complex magnetic topologies. However, the mechanisms governing the formation and eruption of flux ropes, particularly the role of magnetic shear distribution in coronal arcades are not fully understood. We employ magnetohydrodynamic simulations incorporating nonadiabatic effects of optically thin radiative losses, magnetic field-aligned thermal conduction, and spatially varying (steady) background heating, to realistically model the coronal environment. A stratified solar atmosphere under gravity is initialized with a non-force-free field comprising sheared arcades. We study two different cases by varying the initial shear to analyze their resulting dynamics, and the possibility of flux rope formation and eruptions. Our results show that strong initial magnetic shear leads to spontaneous flux rope formation and eruption via magnetic reconnection, driven by Lorentz force. The shear distribution infers the non-potentiality distributed along arcades and demonstrates its relevance in identifying sites prone to eruptive activity. The evolution of mean shear and the relative strength between guide to reconnection fields during the pre- and post-eruption phases are explored, with implications of bulk heating for the ``hot onset'' phenomena in flares, and particle acceleration. On the other hand, the weaker shear case does not lead to formation of any flux ropes. Our findings highlight the limitations of relying solely on foot point shear and underscore the need for coronal scale diagnostics. These results are relevant for understanding eruptive onset conditions and can promote a better interpretation of coronal observations from current and future missions.
#### Dense Molecular Ring-like structure in gaseous CO depletion region G34.74-0.12

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a dense molecular ring-like structure in a dense (10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$), cold (pc-scale CO depletion at a factor of 5), and young (10$^4$ year) star-forming region G34.74-0.12, revealed by C$^{18}$O (2-1), HNC (1-0), and N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The ring-like structure is redshifted with respect to the clump, spanning from $V_{\rm sys,lsr} + 0.9$ to $V_{\rm sys,lsr} + 2.9$ km s$^{-1}$, with a total mass of 109 $M_{\odot}$. It is spatially coincident with 1.3 mm and 3.0 mm dust continuum emission from cores, and several protostellar outflows. However, no free-free emission or H\textsc{ii} region is detected in association with this structure. With a slow expansion speed indicated by the position-velocity diagram, this ring structure differs from rings previously identified in more evolved star-forming regions. Possible explanations for the ring-like structure include a relic wind-blown bubble produced by a deeply embedded young stellar object, a hollow cavity formed by cloud-cloud interactions, a gas ring resulting from a temperature gradient, or a line-of-sight superposition of multiple outflows or dense clouds. This discovery offers a rare observational glimpse into the earliest dynamical processes involved in massive star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Scaling relations between galactic parameters represent key pieces of evidence for investigating the processes of galaxy formation and evolution. In most studies, these relations have been obtained for large portions of the galaxies (i.e., on kpc scales), but it is also important to evaluate these relations in smaller scales. In this work, we used optical data cubes of a subsample of nearby galaxies of the DIVING 3D survey. These allowed us to analyze the scaling relations involving stellar velocity dispersion, stellar population age, and stellar population metallicity at the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of galaxies. We detected correlations between the stellar velocity dispersion and the age, metallicity, and total stellar mass. These correlations are independent of galaxy inclinations, considering all morphological types, nuclear activity, and the presence or absence of galactic bars. We detected, for the first time, a correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion and stellar metallicity in the nuclear regions of galaxies. It is found to be qualitatively consistent with the well-known stellar mass-metallicity relation. We also noted that barred galaxies tend to show younger and less metal-rich stellar populations than unbarred galaxies in the central regions, which may be a consequence of the bar triggering star formation in the nuclear regions of these objects. Some active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in our sample are positioned above the observed correlation between stellar velocity dispersion and stellar population age, suggesting that their nuclear stellar populations are younger than expected. This may be a consequence of positive AGN feedback, triggering star formation. Conversely, starburst galaxies do not show nuclear stellar populations at ages over one billion years.

 - **Abstract**
 The ``Neptunian ridge'' is a recently identified peak in the frequency of planets with sizes between that of Neptune and Saturn orbiting their host stars with periods between 3 and 6 days (A. Castro-González et al. 2024). These planets may have formed similarly to their larger, hot Jupiter counterparts in the ``three-day pile-up'', through a dynamically excited migration pathway. The distribution of stellar obliquities in hot Neptune systems may therefore provide a vital clue as to their origin. We report a new stellar obliquity measurement for TOI-2374\,b, a planet in the Neptunian ridge ($P = 4.31$ days, $R_p = 7.5 R_\oplus$). We observed a spectroscopic transit of TOI-2374 b with the Keck Planet Finder, detecting the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) anomaly with an amplitude of 3 m/s, and measured a sky-projected obliquity of $\lambda = {81^\circ}^{+23^\circ}_{-22^\circ}$, indicating an orbit significantly misaligned with the spin axis of its host star. A reloaded RM analysis of the cross-correlation functions confirms this misalignment, measuring $\lambda = {65^\circ}^{+32^\circ}_{-24^\circ}$. Additionally, we measured a stellar rotation period of $P_\mathrm{rot} = 26.4^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$ days with photometry from the Tierras observatory, allowing us to deduce the three-dimensional stellar obliquity of $\psi = {85.9^\circ}^{+8.6^\circ}_{-9.2^\circ}$. TOI-2374 b joins a growing number of hot Neptunes on polar orbits. The high frequency of misaligned orbits for Neptunian ridge and desert planets, compared with their longer period counterparts, is reminiscent of patterns seen for the giant planets and may suggest a similar formation mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 High-density molecular gas plays a vital role in supporting star formation within galaxies. However, traditional tracers of dense gas, such as the low-$J$ transitions of HCN and HCO$^+$, are predominantly optically thick. This characteristic presents a significant challenge in accurately estimating the column density of dense gas and mapping its spatial distribution. Optically-thin tracers, including HC$_3$N (10-9) and isotopologues of HCN, HCO$^+$, HNC (1-0), among others, emerge as better tracers, by enabling more precise measurements and analyses of the dense gas in galaxies. Here, we present the first high-resolution ($\sim$3.8$''$, corresponding to $\sim$65 pc) molecular line observations of the nearby starburst galaxy M~82 with IRAM Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). Notably, HC$_3$N (10-9) and H$^{13}$CN (1-0) emission lines are brighter at the northeast part (NE lobe) than those at the southwest part (SW lobe) of M~82, suggesting a higher accumulation of dense gas at the NE lobe. The spatial distributions of H41$\alpha$ and 3-mm continuum emission indicate that starburst activity varies across the central starburst disk, with more intense star formation occurring at the SW lobe compared to the NE lobe. The average optical depths of HCN and HCO$^+$ (1-0) across the triple-peaked regions exhibit significant variation, with the highest values observed at the NE lobe. Our results suggest a potential evolutionary sequence in M~82, where the distributions of star formation and dense gas appear to be partially decoupled -- a phenomenon that classical dense gas tracers cannot adequately probe.

 - **Abstract**
 We report JWST NIRCAM and MIRI observations of Sgr B2, the most active site of star formation in the Galaxy. These observations, using 14 filters spanning 1.5 to 25 microns, have revealed a multilayered and highly structured cloud that contains both a revealed, low-extinction and hidden, high-extinction population of massive stars. JWST has detected new candidate HII regions around massive stars previously missed by radio telescopes. MIRI has detected radiation escaping from the forming massive cluster Sgr B2 N along its outflow cavities, demonstrating that infrared radiation finds geometric escape routes even in the densest, most heavily embedded regions in the universe. JWST further highlights the gas asymmetry in the cloud, showing a sharp, straight cutoff along the eastern cloud edge. Despite the great sensitivity of these observations, no extended population of YSOs has been detected, placing a limit on their minimum extinction; this result hints that star formation has only just begun in the cloud. Together, these results suggest that, despite already holding the crown for most actively star-forming cloud, we have underestimated the total star formation in Sgr B2. JWST unveils previously hidden massive stars and ionized structures, offering a transformative view of how stars form under some of the most extreme Galactic conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 The intensity and energy spectrum of energetic charged radiation in the heliosphere are significantly influenced by solar activity. This phenomenon is known as solar modulation of galactic cosmic rays. As interplanetary travel becomes a reality, missions in low Earth orbit become longer and more frequent. In low Earth orbit we need to estimate the influence of Earth's magnetosphere accurately to assess the radiation hazard experienced by astronauts during space missions, there is an emergent need for accurately depicting the space radiation environment and predicting the cosmic-ray flux in the heliosphere. Here we present a new effective and predictive model of solar modulation which incorporates fundamental physics processes of particle transport such as diffusion, convection, and adiabatic cooling to compute the energy spectrum; and temporal evolution of cosmic radiation in the inner heliosphere. Empowered by this model and a time-dependent effective description of the geomagnetic field, we will show our estimates of the dose rates experienced by astronauts over time, as they orbit Earth onboard the International Space Station and while travelling through interplanetary space.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the formation and evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) requires a thorough investigation of the key physical processes involved. While one pathway involves the isolated evolution of massive binary stars, affected by uncertain stages like core-collapse supernovae and common envelope evolution, an alternative channel is dynamical formation in dense stellar environments. Newtonian gravity has traditionally provided a robust and computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale gravitational interactions. However, accurately capturing close encounters and black hole mergers necessitates the use of general relativity. This work focuses on assessing the applicability of post-Newtonian gravity in bridging these regimes, offering a physically insightful and computationally tractable approach to modeling BBH formation in the gravitational-wave era of astronomy.
#### The impact of external gas accretion on the distribution of HI gas in galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Using the data from Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) and HI-MaNGA surveys, we build a sample of 37 gas-star misaligned galaxies with robust HI detections, which are believed to have undergone external gas accretion processes. Both star-forming (SF) and quiescent (QS) misaligned galaxies exhibit narrower HI linewidths compared to their gas-star aligned controls. The HI profiles of SF misaligned galaxies tend to be single-peaked, displaying a slightly higher fraction of single-peaked shape compared to their aligned controls. The QS misaligned galaxies exhibit prominently single-peaked HI profiles, while their aligned controls show distinct double-horned profiles. The shape of HI profiles is expected to change with the HI surface density radial gradients through external gas accretion -- the interaction between the accreted gas and the pre-existing gas leads to the re-distribution of angular momentum and induces gas inflow. It suggests that the progenitors of SF misaligned galaxies are central HI-enriched, in this case, the shape of HI profiles is insensitive to the further increase of central HI surface density. The progenitors of QS misaligned galaxies are central HI-deficient, hence the transition from central HI-deficient to HI-enriched surface density leads to significantly more single-peaked HI profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar flybys are likely to be common in young star-forming regions and could be responsible for substructures observed in protoplanetary discs. Using three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations, we study dust trapping in discs perturbed by parabolic coplanar flybys. We find that spiral structures are induced in the gas and dust discs for both prograde and retrograde encounters. By tracking individual dust particles within the flyby-induced substructures, we determine that they have a highly enhanced dust to gas ratio compared to particles in an unperturbed disc. We further find that the local dust to gas ratios in flyby-induced substructures are sufficiently high to trigger the streaming instability and hence facilitate planetesimal formation in young discs.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We explore frequency-dependent changes in pulsar radio emission by analyzing their profile widths and emission heights, assessing whether the simple radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) or the fan beam model can describe the data. Methods. Using wideband (704-4032 MHz) Murriyang (Parkes) observations of over 100 pulsars, we measured profile widths at multiple intensity levels, fit Gaussian components, and used aberration-retardation effects to estimate emission altitudes. We compared trends in width evolution and emission height with a fan beam model. Results. Similar to other recent studies, we find that while many pulsars show profiles narrowing with increasing frequency, a substan- tial fraction show the reverse. The Gaussian decomposition of the profiles reveals that the peak locations of the components vary little with frequency. However, the component widths do, in general, narrow with increasing frequency. This argues that propagation effects are responsible for the width evolution of the profiles rather than emission height. Overall, the evolution of the emission height with frequency is unclear, and clouded by the assumptions in the model. Spin-down luminosity correlates weakly with profile narrowing but not with emission height. Conclusions. The classic picture where pulsars emit at a single emission height which decreases with increasing observing frequency cannot explain the diversity in behavior observed here. Instead, pulsar beams likely originate from extended regions at multiple altitudes, with fan-beam or patchy structures dominating their frequency evolution. Future models must incorporate realistic plasma physics and multi-altitude emission to capture the range of pulsar behaviors.

 - **Abstract**
 How the event rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs) evolves with redshift is a hot topic to explore their cosmological origin and the circum-burst environment. Particularly, it is urgent to know what the difference of event rates between repeating and non-repeating FRBs is. For the first time, we calculate the event rates of repeating FRBs detected by diverse telescopes at frequencies higher/lower than 1 GHz in this work. Luminosity and redshift are found to be positively correlated with a power law form for both high- and low-frequency FRBs, showing an obvious evolution of luminosity with redshift. Furthermore, we compare the differential luminosity and local event rate distributions of high- and low-luminosity FRBs at different frequencies. It is found that the event rates of these sub-samples of repeating FRBs similarly exceed the star formation rate at lower redshift than 1. Interestingly, we confirm with bootstrap method that the event rates of low-frequency FRBs exhibit different evolution patterns and are higher than that of high-frequency ones.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Dark Energy Survey 5-year sample, we determine the properties of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) host galaxies across a wide multi-wavelength range - from the optical to far-infrared - including data from the $Herschel$ and $Spitzer$ space telescopes. We categorise the SNe Ia into three distinct groups according to the distribution of their host galaxies on the star-formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass ($M_\star$) plane. Each region comprises host galaxies at distinct stages in their evolutionary pathways: Region 1 - low-mass hosts; Region 2 - high-mass, star-forming hosts and Region 3 - high-mass, passive hosts. We find SNe Ia in host galaxies located in Region 1 have the steepest slope (quantified by $\beta$) between their colours and luminosities, with $\beta_{\mathrm{R_1}} = 3.51 \pm 0.16$. This differs at the ${\sim}6\sigma$ significance level to SNe Ia in Region 3, which have the shallowest colour-luminosity slope with $\beta_{\mathrm{R_3}} = 2.12 \pm 0.16$. After correcting SNe Ia in each subsample by their respective $\beta$, events in Region 3 (high-mass, passive hosts) are $0.07 - 0.12$ mag ($>3\sigma$) brighter, post-standardisation. We conclude that future cosmological analyses should apply standardisation relations to SNe Ia based upon the region in which the SN host galaxy lies in the SFR-$M_\star$ plane. Alternatively, cosmological analyses should restrict the SN Ia sample to events whose host galaxies occupy a single region of this plane.

 - **Abstract**
 We characterize two candidate cool galactic outflows in two relatively low mass, highly inclined Virgo cluster galaxies: NGC4424 and NGC4694. Previous analyses of observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) carbon monoxide (CO) line emission maps did not classify these sources as cool outflow hosts. Using new high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, JWST mid-infrared photometry in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-tracing F770W band, we identify extended structures present off of the stellar disk. The identified structures are bright in the MIRI F770W and F2100W bands, suggesting they include PAHs as well as other dust grains. As PAHs have been shown to be destroyed in hot, ionized gas, these structures are likely to be outflows of cool (T$\leq 10^4$K) gas. This work represents an exciting possibility for using mid infrared observations to identify and measure outflows in lower mass, lower star formation galaxies.
#### High-energy interstellar isomers: cis-N-methylformamide in the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud

 - **Abstract**
 Isomerism in complex organic molecules provides key insights into the formation mechanisms and physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM). Among the C$_2$H$_5$NO isomers, only acetamide and trans-N-methylformamide (trans-NMF) have been detected in space. The recent detection of higher-energy isomers in other chemical families raises questions about the formation and abundance of less stable isomers. We used ultra-sensitive wide-band spectral surveys obtained with the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes to search for cis-NMF towards the Galactic Centre molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. We present the first detection of cis-NMF in the ISM, with 55 unblended or slightly blended transitions, 44 of which were new transitions identified based on extrapolated spectroscopic data. Due to the lack of collisional rate coefficients, a quasi-non-LTE analysis, which separated the transitions into different K$_a$ ladders, was used to determine the excitation conditions. The resulting trans/cis-NMF isomeric ratio of 2.9$\pm$0.6 deviates significantly from thermodynamic expectations, suggesting that kinetic non-equilibrium processes and stereospecific chemical pathways are responsible for the formation of cis-NMF in this environment. The detection of cis-NMF expands the known inventory of interstellar C$_2$H$_5$NO isomers and challenges the assumption that isomer abundances strictly correlate with thermodynamic stability. Laboratory and theoretical studies propose formation via CH$_3$NCO hydrogenation or spin-forbidden reactions involving CH$_2$ and NH$_2$CHO, though these may not reflect typical ISM conditions. This finding highlights the need for further investigation into isomerisation mechanisms and constrains astrochemical models of complex organic molecules.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs with infrared excess emission provide a window into the late stages of stellar evolution and the dynamics of circumstellar environments. Using data from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), we characterized 30 white dwarfs exhibiting infrared excess, including 29 DA and 1 DB stars. While an infrared excess can arise from dusty disks or cool (sub-)stellar companions, our sample is limited to stellar companions due to our selection based on SDSS photometry, which is sensitive to excess emission at wavelengths $\lambda < 1\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. Our sample contains 22 newly identified excess sources not previously reported in the literature. Spectroscopic observations are available for 10 sources via SDSS, of which only 8 have prior spectroscopic classifications in the literature. In this paper, we present the determination of the effective temperature and surface gravity of these white dwarfs. We used the Balmer line profiles to compare with current atmospheric models to determine the photospheric parameters of the white dwarfs, minimizing contamination introduced by the infrared source. We used photometric data from the SDSS and the \textit{Gaia} mission to resolve the degeneracies between hot and cold solutions from spectroscopy, constraining the photospheric parameters. These results help refine our understanding of white dwarf evolution in binary systems, focusing on stellar companions that cause the infrared excess. This study contributes to identifying systems with potential substellar companions or unresolved stellar partners, adding to the growing effort to map out the fate of planetary systems after their host stars evolve beyond the main sequence.

 - **Abstract**
 The gas-phase metallicity distribution in galaxies provides significant information on their evolution. We report the discovery of nega- tive radial gradients in the gas-phase metallicity of the narrow-line region of the nine galaxies in the Measuring Active Galactic Nuclei Under MUSE Microscope (MAGNUM) galaxies: Centaurus A, Circinus, IC 5063, NGC 1068, NGC 1365, NGC 1386, NGC 2992, NGC 4945, NGC 5643. From strong-line abundance relations for active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming regions, along with emission-line ratio diagnostics, we determine spatially resolved gas-phase metallicities for the kinematic components, galaxy disc and outflow. These relations involve sensitive strong emission lines, specifically [O III]5007, [N II]6584, H{\alpha}, H\b{eta}, [S II]6716, and [S II]6731. The existence of predominantly negative radial metallicity gradients in these AGN host galaxies indicates that metals are not necessarily moved from the central regions to the outskirts by AGN activity and that the gas-phase metallicity in galaxies may follow the general inside-out star formation scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 We report a new population of objects discovered using the data from the James Webb Space Telescope, which are characterized by their point-like morphology and narrow permitted emission lines. Our sample includes nine objects found in three JWST wide survey fields, which have z=3.624 to 5.378 and M_B ~ -18.3 to -21.4 mag. Their light distributions follow gaussian profiles, with the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) values only 3.7%--34.6% larger than those of the point spread functions. Their sharpest FWHM sizes correspond to only 0.49 to 0.96 kpc. They have very strong [O III] and Halpha lines (median rest-frame equivalent widths of 1610.6 and 1374.0 A, respectively), and the line widths of the latter are only 150--360 km/s. Due to the limitation of the current data, the exact nature of this new population is still uncertain. The emission line diagnostics shows that at least one object is consistent with being AGN. On the other hand, the spectral energy distributions of most of the nine objects can be fitted reasonably by normal galaxy templates, which suggest that they could also be very young (median age of 120 Myrs), star-forming (median star formation rate of 1.8 Msun/yr) galaxies in the early formation stage (having acquired a median stellar mass of only 10^{8.4} Msun). If they are indeed star-forming galaxies, their gas-phase metallicities range from 12+log(O/H) = 7.8 to 8.3. It will be critical to understand this population by deeper medium-resolution spectroscopy in the future. If they are AGNs, they constitute a new kind of type 2 AGNs that are low-luminosity and almost "hostless". If they are star-forming galaxies, they also constitute a new kind whose early formation is likely a secular process starting from a very compact core, which is in line with the picture of a monolithic collapse.
