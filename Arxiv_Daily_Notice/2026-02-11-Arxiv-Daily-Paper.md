 - **Abstract**
 Low-mass or dwarf galaxies (M$_{\ast}<10^{9}$ M${\odot}$) are abundant in the Universe, yet their formation and evolution remain poorly understood. Their enhanced sensitivity to feedback from star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) make them excellent laboratories to test whether feedback prescriptions in cosmological simulations accurately reproduce their interstellar medium (ISM) properties. We present JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of nine dwarf galaxies from COSMOS-Web survey at redshift $z<0.08$, with star formation rates ranging from 0.003-0.3 M${\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and stellar masses of log M$_{\ast}\sim8-9$ M$_{\odot}$. The detection rate with both NIRCam and MIRI is 100\%, indicating that these dwarfs possess substantial ISM content. The detected sample includes a roughly equal mix of early-type and late-type dwarfs, suggesting that it is representative of the broader dwarf galaxy population in low-density environments. We find that the observed MIRI flux distributions are comparable to forward-modelled flux distributions of mass-matched simulated galaxies in TNG50. We further conduct a multi-wavelength morphological analysis complementing the JWST NIRCam and MIRI imaging with archival HST/ACS data, employing the CAS (concentration, asymmetry, smoothness) framework. Among the multi-wavelength images, MIRI exhibits the largest variation in CAS parameters, likely due to dust lanes and clumps in several galaxies, also suggested by Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting. This suggests that the dust content in these systems may be higher than those implied by rest-frame optical or near-infrared observations alone. Upcoming UV/optical and mid-infrared spectroscopic follow-up will be critical for constraining the gas kinematics and dust grain properties of dwarf galaxies in low-density environments such as COSMOS.

 - **Abstract**
 The high-redshift progenitors of present-day galaxy clusters are believed to substantially contribute to the global star-formation rate density and drive the large-scale reionization of the Universe. Here we present a blind and unbiased search for and characterization of galaxy overdensities during the reionization epoch at redshifts $z\sim 5.5-7$, based on rest-frame optical JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy of the Abell\,2744 lensing field as part of the JWST-ALT survey. Using a physically-motivated, cosmological inference Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm, we identify six galaxy overdensities, including five robust systems at $z=5.66$ to $6.77$. They are all characterized by total halo masses $M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$ inferred from a range of proxies. We find that the galaxy members in these overdense environments are on average less massive though equally metal-rich, and generally comprised of younger stellar populations as indicated from their bluer spectral slopes less prominent Balmer breaks, than field galaxies at similar redshifts. Further, we use this novel rest-frame optical selection of galaxy proto-clusters to infer the fraction and 3D distribution of strong Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) and damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) in the overdensity environments. We find that two out of six galaxy overdensities have excess \hi\ absorption compared to the field-average, while the other four are consistent within their large scatter in density. These results present the first direct observational constraints on the tomography of the dense, neutral gas reservoirs in large-scale galaxy overdensities at $z>5$ and highlight the limitations of pre-JWST searches for reionization-era galaxy overdensities relying on the detection of strong LAEs alone.[Abridged]
#### Downsizing does not extend to dwarf galaxies: identifying the stellar mass regimes shaped by supernova and AGN feedback

 - **Abstract**
 We explore how the fraction of red (quenched) galaxies varies in the dwarf galaxy regime (10^7 MSun < Mstar < 10^9.5 MSun), using a mass-complete sample of ~5900 dwarfs at z<0.15, constructed using deep multi-wavelength data in the COSMOS field. The red fraction decreases steadily until Mstar ~ 10^8.5 MSun and then increases again towards lower stellar masses. This 'U' shape demonstrates that the traditional notion of 'downsizing' (i.e. that progressively lower mass galaxies maintain star formation until later epochs) is incorrect -- downsizing does not continue uninterrupted into the dwarf regime. The U shape persists regardless of environment, indicating that it is driven by internal processes rather than external environment-driven mechanisms. Our results suggest that, at Mstar < 10^8 MSun, the quenching of star formation is dominated by supernova (SN) feedback and becomes more effective with decreasing stellar mass, as the potential well becomes shallower. At Mstar > 10^9 MSun, the quenching is driven by a mix of SN feedback and AGN feedback (which becomes more effective with increasing stellar mass, as central black holes become more massive). The processes that quench star formation are least effective in the range 10^8 MSun < Mstar < 10^9 MSun, likely because the potential well is deep enough to weaken the impact of SN feedback, while the effect of AGN feedback is still insignificant. The cosmological simulations tested here do not match the details of how the red fraction varies as a function of stellar mass -- we propose that the red fraction vs stellar mass relation (particularly in the dwarf regime) is a powerful calibrator for the processes that regulate star formation in galaxy formation models.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarimetric interferometry is a powerful tool for probing both black hole accretion physics and the background spacetime. Current models aimed at explaining the observed multiwavelength flares in Sgr A* often assume hotspots moving on geodesic, Keplerian orbits. In many scenarios, though, a hotspot may instead follow an inspiraling trajectory, potentially transitioning into a plunge toward the black hole. In this work, we present a general framework to simulate the polarized emission from generic equatorial inspiraling hotspots in Kerr spacetime using a parametric four-velocity profile. This parametrization defines a continuous family of flows, ranging from Cunningham's disk model (fixed radius orbits outside the innermost stable circular orbit and plunging motion within the innermost stable circular orbit) to purely radial motion, thereby extending the standard assumptions. Within this framework, we show that inspiral motion produces a distinctive observational signature: a precessing, unwinding evolution of the polarimetric Stokes Q-U looping pattern, in sharp contrast with the closed Q-U loops associated with stable orbits at a fixed radius. We then explore how the morphology of these signatures depends on black hole spin, observer inclination, and magnetic-field configuration. The presented model can be applied to current and near-future interferometric observations of linear polarization, offering a new avenue to probe the physics of matter spiraling inward and the relativistic velocities of plunging plasma.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of the first transient relativistic iron K{\alpha} line in an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) J1047+5907. The line was detected 21.5 days (rest-frame) after an X-ray coronal flare observed in 2008 and it exhibits significant broadening consistent with relativistic reflection from the accretion disk in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). The line has a width of ~300 eV, corresponding to a Keplerian velocity of 14,000 km s-1, at a distance of 5-41 light-days from the SMBH, strongly implying that the observed coronal flare triggered the emergence of the line. This event provides rare direct evidence of the response of the accretion disk to impulsive coronal illumination and offers a new method to probe the SMBH and disk physics. The relativistic modeling favors a broadened line produced by distant reflection from an accretion disk around a rapidly spinning black hole viewed at an intermediate inclination, consistent with other observations. Systematic monitoring of type 1 AGN following strong X-ray flares may open a new observational window into the innermost regions of AGN, enabling constraints on the physics of SMBH and its accretion disk at different radii that are otherwise challenging to access.
#### Origin of Hyperion and Saturn's Rings in A Two-Stage Saturnian System Instability

 - **Abstract**
 The age of the rings and some of the moons of Saturn is an open question, and multiple lines of evidence point to a recent (few hundred Myr ago) cataclysm involving disruption of past moons. The main driver of the evolution of the Saturnian system is the relatively rapid tidal expansion of its largest moon, Titan, which is likely driven by resonant tides within Saturn. The obliquity of Saturn and the orbit of the small moon Hyperion both serve as a record of the past orbital evolution of Titan. Saturn's obliquity was likely generated by a secular spin-orbit resonance with the planets, while Hyperion is caught in a mean-motion resonance with Titan, with both phenomena driven by Titan's orbital expansion. We propose that the breaking of Saturn's spin resonance was also the event in which Hyperion formed, when an outer mid-sized satellite (``Proto-Hyperion'') was destabilized and collided with Titan, with some of the debris accreting into Hyperion. During the instability Proto-Hyperion's perturbations produced the observed orbital inclination of Iapetus. The same event also excited the eccentricity of Titan, which then, through Titan's resonant interaction with the inner moons, led to destabilization, collisional disruption and re-accretion of the inner moon system, including the rings. We present numerical integrations that show that this chain of events has a relatively high probability, and discuss how it fits within our knowledge of the Saturnian system.

 - **Abstract**
 Post-StarBurst (PSB) galaxies are galaxies that have undergone a large burst of star formation followed by rapid quenching. Understanding their properties as a population can help us better understand how galaxies evolve to quiescence. This project aims to use Star Formation History (SFH) measurements from the Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys MaNGA, CALIFA, and AMUSING++ processed with the Pipe3D analysis pipeline in order to select PSB galaxies as well as PSB regions in galaxies. Most PSB selection methods use cutoffs determined by spectral features, but in this work we introduce a new PSB selection method based directly on the property we are most interested in; inferred SFHs. IFS data allows us to probe a galaxy's star formation on a spatially resolved scale, enabling us to examine the size, shape, and location of PSB regions within a galaxy. We select 107 PSB galaxies, only 7 of which are among known PSBs selected by other methods. Unlike traditional PSB selection methods, our approach is not biased against Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Despite this, we still find no evidence for a significant Seyfert 2 PSB population, suggesting that strong AGN activity is uncommon throughout the PSB phase. Our spatially-resolved SFH selection identifies a wide range of galaxies, including globally quiescent elliptical galaxies with centrally-concentrated PSB spaxels, galaxies with ring-like PSB spaxels and a preference for inside-out age gradients (contrary to what has previously been observed in the literature), and galaxies with widespread PSB regions that have significant star formation elsewhere in the galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 A fundamental challenge in star formation is understanding how a protostar accretes mass from its circumstellar disk while removing excess angular momentum. Protostellar jets are widely invoked as the primary channels for angular momentum removal, yet the mechanism by which they are launched and extract angular momentum remains poorly constrained. Here we report high-resolution ALMA Band 7 (345 GHz) and Band 6 (230 GHz) observations of CO (3-2), CO (2-1), and SiO (5-4) emission from the protostar HOPS 10 (G209.55-19.68S2). The combined data trace both the entrained outflow and the collimated jet with excellent spatial and velocity resolution, revealing a uniquely monopolar protostellar jet, the clearest example reported to date. The system exhibits a distinctly unipolar high-velocity jet with velocity offsets of +44 to +66 km s-1, unlike the predominantly bipolar morphology characteristic of most protostellar jets. While the low-velocity outflow, with velocity offsets of -20 to +30 km s-1, is detected in both directions, the high-velocity jet appears only on one side, and this monopolarity is consistent across all tracers. Given the nearly edge-on geometry and low submillimeter extinction, comparable emission would normally be expected from both lobes. The shock tracer SiO emission confirms a genuine, highly collimated jet rather than cloud contamination, and no ambient structure is capable of obscuring a counterjet. We argue that intrinsically asymmetric mass loading along the disk magnetic field lines provides the most plausible explanation for the observed monopolarity.
#### A deep MeerKAT view of associated HI absorption in radio AGNs at intermediate redshift: Role of absorber geometry and conditions of the gas

 - **Abstract**
 We present MeerKAT observations searching for HI absorption in a sample of 17 powerful ($L_{\rm 1.4GHz}> 10^{27}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) radio sources at intermediate redshifts ($0.25<z<0.7$). The sample is well characterised at radio and optical wavelengths, allowing us to connect the presence (or absence) of HI to the properties of the AGN and its host galaxy. The sample consists mostly of core-dominated sources and quasars. Half of the targets have a UV luminosity $L_{\rm UV} = 10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, above this limit, the gas would be expected to be ionised by this radiation. We obtained 15 spectra free (or almost free) of radio frequency interference, reaching extremely low optical depths ($\tau_{\rm peak} < 0.005$) resulting in three new HI absorption detections. Two are associated HI absorptions, giving a detection rate of such systems of $13\%\pm 7\%$. Both are found in young radio sources (PKS 1151-34 and PKS 1306-09), confirming the trend that this type of sources are more often detected in HI compared to more evolved ones. The UV luminosity of both these sources is below $10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. Surprisingly, one of the detections (PKS 1151-34) is hosted by a quasar, suggesting that the radio lobes are still embedded in the circumnuclear disc. In the second source (PKS 1306-09), the HI is highly blueshifted and likely part of a jet-driven outflow. A third detection is a 'local intervening' system, caused by a galaxy in the local environment of PKS 0405-12 and located in front of the southern radio lobe of this source, about 100 kpc in projection from this quasar. Overall, the results indicate a variety of plausible situations, which resemble what is seen at low redshifts. For the associated absorption, a combination of evolutionary status of the radio sources, physical conditions, and geometry of the gas structure determine the detection rate of HI absorption.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectral line analysis of the hot molecular core G10.47+0.03 (hereafter, G10). Our aim is to determine molecular abundances and excitation conditions across a wide spectral range inaccessible to ground-based observatories. We utilize archival data from the Herschel Space Observatory, obtained with the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI). We report here the detection of high-excitation CO, 13CO, and C18O, H2O isotopologues, HCO+, HCN, HNC, CS, C34S, SO, SO2, H2CS, and CH3OH. CO, p-H2O, CS, and HCN show similar velocity profiles with a narrow, blueshifted component, which may be linked to the outer outflow layer. Redshifted wings may indicate inner outflow activity. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework is employed to infer column densities and temperatures accurately. We also performed spectral energy distribution fitting to constrain the global physical parameters of G10, providing essential context for interpreting the molecular emission. The MCMC analysis revealed two excitation temperature components: a warm component (30-65 K) and a hot component (90-250 K). The higher temperatures indicate dense, hot gas typical of massive hot cores. The lower temperatures correspond to the warm, less dense envelope around the core. Transitions of H2O, high-excitation CO, and HCN indicate outflowing gas and high-density shocked regions. These findings highlight G10's complex dynamical environment.
#### Organic Acid Chemistry in ISM: Detection of Formic Acid and its Prebiotic Chemistry in Hot Core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1

 - **Abstract**
 In the interstellar medium, formic acid (HCOOH) plays a significant role in the synthesis of the simplest amino acid, glycine (NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH). The presence of HCOOH suggests that oxygen-bearing molecules may be directly involved in the chemical and physical evolution of star formation regions, particularly in hot molecular cores. This paper presents the first detection of the rotational emission lines of the $trans$-conformer of HCOOH toward the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, located in the massive star formation region G358.93$-$0.03. This study employed high-resolution observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 7. The column density and excitation temperature of $t$-HCOOH are determined as $(8.13\pm0.72)\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $120\pm15$ K, respectively. The fractional abundance of $t$-HCOOH relative to H$_{2}$ is $(2.62\pm 0.29)\times 10^{-9}$. The column density ratios of $t$-HCOOH/CH$_{3}$OH and $t$-HCOOH/H$_{2}$CO are $(1.56 \pm 0.12)\times 10^{-2}$ and $(1.16 \pm 0.12)$, respectively. We computed a three-phase warm-up chemical model of HCOOH using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. We found that the observed and modelled abundances of HCOOH are almost identical, within a factor of 0.89. Based on chemical modelling, we showed that HCOOH may be formed through the reaction between HCO and OH on the grain surface, which is further released in the gas-phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We present multi-wavelength observations of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 5938 (Araish) to investigate the origin of its radio emission, specifically the contribution from active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and star formation. Using Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) data, we detect extended radio emission extending outwards to the galactic axis, with a steep non-thermal spectral index ($\alpha = -1.2 \pm 0.2$) indicative of synchrotron radiation from an AGN jet. The jet has a physical extent of $\approx 8.2\,kpc$ (angular length of $64^{\prime\prime}$). Multi-wavelength data from The Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey 2 (DECaPS2), Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) provide further support for this interpretation. The colour-colour diagram presenting WISE infrared observations suggests the presence of dust and young stars that trace the galaxy's disk structure. Our analysis reveals a radio jet, alongside star formation traced by infrared emission, demonstrating the complex interplay of AGN activity and star formation in this well-resolved galaxy. Intriguingly, the spatial relationship reveals the brighter X-ray emission to be largely adjacent to and enveloping the extended radio emission. This suggests that the radio jet, while extending at a significant angle to the galactic disk, is confined by the larger X-ray gas halo, similar to other systems (i.e., ESO 295-IG022, Centaurus A) and may indicate jet collimation and channelling effects.

 - **Abstract**
 We present here two H II region catalogues with azimuthal resolution for the two grand design galaxies NGC 628 and NGC 6946. With the help of these catalogues, we study several properties of the star-forming processes occurring in spiral galaxies. We obtained direct imaging in the narrow-band filters centred at H{\alpha}, H\b{eta}, [O II]{\lambda}3727, and [O III]{\lambda}{\lambda}4959, 5007 and their respective continua. After the calibration and correction of the data, we obtained for each H II region the de-reddened fluxes in the aforementioned lines, the size, the H{\alpha} equivalent width, and, using two different empirical calibrations, the metallicity. Employing a method based on the Delaunay triangulation, a two-dimensional (2D) representation of the metallicity was obtained. Data for 209 H II regions of NGC 628 and 226 H II regions of NGC 6946 are obtained. The radial behaviours of the H{\alpha} equivalent width, the excitation, and the oxygen abundance are derived. Two-dimensional representations of the metallicity and the excitation are calculated for the galaxies in the study. The two empirical calibrations of the metallicity are compared. The oxygen abundance gradients obtained in this study agree with previously published values. However, more regions were examined than in previous studies. We find a difference of about 0.6 dex between the two empirical calibrations employed. Finally, the 2D representations of the metallicity reveal high metallicity knots in NGC 628, and for NGC 6946 a high metallicity azimuthal structure is discovered. These high metallicity regions seem to be linked to the arms of the galaxies and are probably produced by an increase in the temperature of the ionizing clusters in the H II regions, which may be linked to variations in the initial mass functions of the galaxies between the arm and interarm regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave (GW) detections by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observatories suggest multiple formation channels for GW compact binary mergers. Here I assess the role of young massive clusters (YMC) evolving into old open clusters (OC) -- the YMC/OC channel -- to the GW merger population. A homogeneous grid of 90 N-body evolutionary model star clusters, spanning initial masses of $10^4M_\odot\leq M_{cl}(0)\leq10^5M_\odot$, half-mass radii of 1-3 pc, and metallicities between 0.0002-0.02 is computed with the direct, post-Newtonian N-body code NBODY7. The N-body simulations include primordial binaries, delayed stellar-remnant model forming black holes (BH) and neutron stars (NS), BH spin prescriptions, and GW recoil kicks, and they are evolved until BH depletion. Most GW mergers from the cluster models are dynamically assembled binary black holes (BBH) that merge within their host clusters. Merger mass ratios reach down to 0.1-0.2 despite an overall bias toward nearly symmetric pairs. The GW merger efficiency varies non-monotonically with cluster mass, peaking around $M_{cl}(0)=7.5\times10^4M_\odot$ and also for $M_{cl}(0)\leq3.0\times10^4M_\odot$. The computed mergers reproduce some of the key features of the latest observed GW event catalogue, including asymmetric low-mass mergers, misaligned events among highly spinning, massive BHs, and an excess of $30M_\odot$ primaries, though they under-produce $10M_\odot$ primaries, hinting at contributions from other channels. The model merger rate density accounts for 25%-33% of the observed rate; it increases with redshift somewhat faster than the cosmic star formation, consistently with LVK's inferences. The model effective spin distribution is positively asymmetric at zero redshift and broadens with redshift. The models yield field BH- and NS-main sequence star binaries with parameters consistent with the Gaia-discovered candidates. [Abgd.]

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar outbursts from variable or periodic accretion are thought to be ubiquitous across young stellar populations. However, relatively few outbursting objects have been discovered to date. Here, we present the characterisation of a new EXor-type episodic accretor. We aim to characterise the nature of the 2023 outburst of SPICY 97589/Gaia23bab and characterise the stellar source for the first time, while exploring how an accretion outburst contributes to disk evolution. We employ multi-waveband medium-resolution spectroscopy with UVB-VIS-NIR coverage during the peak of the 2023 outburst and the post-outburst quiescent object. The broad wavelength coverage of the dataset allows for robust measurements of the accretion rate using known line tracers. The addition of quiescent spectra provides a good estimation of stellar parameters of the central star while also informing us on the evolution of the disk during outburst phases. We find the stellar source to be a 3410\,K, M3.0 type star with a luminosity of 0.41 $L_\odot$ and an estimated stellar mass of 0.29 $M_\odot$. We measure the accretion rate of SPICY 97589 to be $\dot M = 2.38\pm0.58\times10^{-7}\,\mathrm{M_\odot yr^{-1}}$. This value is at two orders of magnitude greater than the quiescent accretion rate. Thus, we confirm that the 2023 outburst was driven by an influx of material from the surrounding environment to the central star, an accretion outburst. The spectral fingerprint of emission lines is also characteristic of an outbursting EXor-type source, including variable disk winds.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the diagnostic potential of the G-band at 430.4 nm for probing small-scale magnetic fields in the solar photosphere. Combining three-dimensional MHD simulations from the MURaM code and spectral synthesis via the RH 1.5D code, we evaluate the intensity contrast in the G-band filtergrams by comparing the filter centered at 430.4 nm in comparison to the conventional 430.5 nm. Our results show that filtergrams centered at 430.4 nm provide higher contrast across varying magnetic environments, particularly at narrow filter widths. This enhancement arises from its slightly higher formation height and greater sensitivity to temperature variations in magnetized regions. These findings indicate that G-band filtergrams centered at 430.4 nm show enhanced diagnostic potential under the assumptions of the present modeling. The obtained results are also relevant and suggest potential applications in stellar contexts, where molecular bands are often used as proxies for magnetic activity.

 The circumnuclear star-forming ring of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1097 provides a unique laboratory to study star formation under extreme conditions. This work aims to derive the physical properties of the circumnuclear star-forming regions (CNSFRs) using MUSE integral field spectroscopy observations. A total of 24 individual ionised HII are identified and analysed within its ring, which spans from $\sim$385 pc to $\sim$1.3 kpc. Despite the complex nuclear activity, all HII regions are found to be purely photoionised. Directly derived abundances reveal supersolar metallicities, with the highest one exceeding five times the solar value (12+log(S/H) = 7.875 $\pm$ 0.353, T$_e$([SIII]) = 3912 $\pm$ 567 K), and representing the highest abundance reported to date. In this high-metallicity regime, we find a break in the ionisation parameter-[SII]/[SIII] relation, which can be explained by changes in the ionisation structure and line emissivities, as confirmed by photoionisation models that successfully reproduce the observed emission-line ratios. Our results also indicate that the local gas supply regulates the star formation activity within the ring, with the young stars ionising 8 % of the total gas in the ring. Furthermore, our findings support a propagating starburst scenario, originating in the galaxy nucleus and extending towards the ends of the bar and into the circumnuclear ring through bar-driven shocks, this being consistent with the results of previous multi-wavelength studies. Finally, we likely detect optical signatures associated with one of the two known jets in this galaxy. This finding, together with the radio core emission previously found at sub-parsec scales, reflects the presence of feedback processes operating even on small galactic disc scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear runaways in certain white dwarfs in binary systems. They have been extensively studied, yet their progenitor and explosion mechanisms remain poorly understood. We study a large sample of SNe Ia comparing the narrow interstellar absorption features in their spectra with various photometric and spectroscopic supernova properties, as well as with environmental characteristics. We find that the sodium absorption is significantly stronger in younger, more star-forming and more centrally located SNe Ia, as expected. However, we also show that there is a strong dependence on intrinsic properties that is independent of the environment. In fact, we find strong evidence for two environmental SN Ia populations, an old and a young one, with the young population showing significantly different distributions of sodium strength when divided according to the Si II ejecta velocity, nebular velocity, extinction, E(B-V), and reddening curve, RV. Performing a clustering of the SNe Ia, we recover an old population of SNe with low extinction and normal ejecta velocity, while we confirm that the young population can be subdivided into a group of highly-extincted, high-velocity SNe Ia with much stronger blueshifted sodium absorption, and another of low-extincted, normal-velocity objects with little sodium absorption. We interpret this relation of intervening material with intrinsic properties as evidence for the young SN Ia population, occurring in young and star-forming environments, to have asymmetric radiation that interacts with nearby material, and whose observables depend thus on the viewing angle. Finally, we show that the cosmological mass-step is consistent with these populations.
