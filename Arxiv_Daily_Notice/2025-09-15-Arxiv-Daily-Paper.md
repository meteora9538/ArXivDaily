 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of two low-mass, high-redshift, quiescent galaxies, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1, using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy alongside NIRCam and MIRI photometry. Observed at a redshift of z=5.39 and z=5.11 respectively, and with stellar masses of $\rm 10^{9.6}M_\odot$ and $\rm 10^{9.5}M_\odot$, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1 are two of the most distant quiescent galaxies spectroscopically confirmed to-date, and are by far the least massive ($\sim10\times$ lower mass). Full spectrophotometric modelling reveals that COS-z5-Q1 appears to have quenched more than 300Myr prior to observation ($z\sim 7$) and has a formation redshift of around z$\sim$11, whilst GS-z5-Q1 formed and quenched in a single burst around 150Myr prior to observation ($z\sim6$). GS-z5-Q1 is found to lie near the centre of a known high-z overdensity in GOODS-S, as would be expected by galaxy formation models, while COS-z5-Q1 lies towards the outskirts of an overdense region. This highlights the role that environment could play in accelerating galaxy evolutionary processes and could possibly be linked to the galaxies' quiescent nature. By modelling their stellar populations, we show that these types of low-mass quiescent galaxies could potentially be descendants of the higher-z "mini-quenched" galaxies. The discovery of these two low-mass $z>5$ quiescent galaxies illuminates a previously undiscovered galaxy population and motivates dedicated follow-up surveys to investigate the overall population.

 - **Abstract**
 [Shortened for arXiv] We conduct a systematic search for $\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 9.5$ quiescent galaxies at $z > 3$ in six extragalactic deep fields observed with NIRCam, with the goal of extracting their physical and statistical features in a uniform and self-consistent manner. We exploit the ASTRODEEP-JWST photometric catalogs to single out robust candidates, including sources quenched only a few tens of Myr before the observation. We apply a SED-fitting procedure which explores three functional forms of star formation history and the $\chi^2$ probabilities of the solutions, with additional checks to minimise the contamination from interlopers, tuning our selection criteria against available spectroscopic data from the DAWN archive and simulated catalogs. We select 633 candidates, which we rank by a reliability parameter based on the probabilities of the quiescent and alternative star-forming solutions, with 291 candidates tagged as "gold". According to the best-fit models, 79\% of the massive ($\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 10.5$) quiescent galaxies at $3 < z < 5$ stopped forming stars at least 150 Myr before the time of observation, while 89\% of low-mass sources have been quenched for less than 150 Myr. The abundance of low-mass old quiescent systems does not increase significantly with time from $z = 5$ to 3: low-mass objects seem to be experiencing a short episode of quenching followed by rejuvenation (``breathing''), consistent with a downsizing scenario of galaxy formation. We also find an abrupt drop in the density of massive quiescent candidates at $z > 5$. We derive estimates for the number density of early passive galaxies up to $z = 10$ and compare them against various models: tensions with data remain in the modeling of the observed bimodality of time passed since quenching as a function of mass.

 - **Abstract**
 IceAct is an array of imaging air Cherenkov telescopes located at the ice surface above the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Each telescope features a silicon photomultiplier based 61 pixel camera and a Fresnel-lens as imaging optic, resulting in a 12-degree field of view. The design is optimized to be operated in harsh environments, particularly at the South Pole. The setup will consist of seven telescopes in a so-called fly's eye configuration, increasing the field of view to 36^\circ, and an additional telescope 200m apart for stereoscopic observations. Rigorous testing procedures have been performed before deployment to ensure that operation under these conditions is possible, e.g. night sky observations and cold temperature tests. Furthermore, on-site calibrations are used to verify the accuracy and reliability of the installation. We derive the geometric alignment of each IceAct telescope by comparing the directional reconstruction of muons measured with IceCube to the corresponding primary particle direction reconstruction from IceAct. This contribution presents these testing procedures. Additionally, we present the on-site alignment calibration, including a Graph Neural Network reconstruction for the primary particle direction in IceAct, verification on Monte Carlo simulation, and the application to a commissioning dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent efforts to identify secondary variations in the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) have primarily focused on simulations examining the role of large-scale cosmic environments such as superclusters, filaments, and underdense regions or voids. If present, these variations could yield valuable insights into galaxy formation mechanisms, halo assembly processes, and the influence of external factors on cosmic structure. We aim to test whether secondary trends in the HOD driven by the large-scale structure of the Universe are detectable observationally. In particular, we examine whether the HOD depends on distance to key features of the cosmic web by explicitly quantifying these spatial relationships. We also analyze whether HODs vary across different cosmic environments, defined by critical point classifications, and assess the influence of intrinsic galaxy properties such as central galaxy color. We create volume-limited galaxy samples from SDSS-DR18 and use a group catalog to determine halo masses and identify central and satellite membership. Additionally, we employ a DisPerSE catalog to locate critical points such as maxima, minima, and filaments in the cosmic web. We evaluate how the HOD varies with proximity to these features and across five distinct cosmic environments. We further examine trends related to the color of central galaxies and test the robustness of our results with alternative DisPerSE catalogs generated using different smoothing scales and persistence thresholds. Our analysis shows that large-scale environments only weakly influence the HOD. However, second-order dependencies may be revealed through a multivariate approach that combines local and large-scale metrics with intrinsic galaxy properties. Future work with next-generation surveys and advanced modeling may achieve the precision required to detect and characterize these subtle environmental correlations.
#### Initial conditions for tidal synchronisation of a planet by its moon

 - **Abstract**
 Moons tidally interact with their host planets and stars. A close moon is quickly synchronised by the planet, or becomes captured in a higher spin-orbit resonance. However, the planet requires much more time to significantly alter its rotation rate under the influence of moon-generated tides. The situation becomes more complex for close-in planets, as star-generated tides come into play and compete with the moon-generated tides. Synchronisation of the planet by its moon changes the tidal dynamics of the entire star-planet-moon system and can lead to long-term stable configurations. In this paper, we demonstrate that a certain initial condition must be met for this to occur. Based on the angular-momentum conservation, the derived condition is universal and bears no dependence upon the planet's internal structure or tidal dissipation model. It is applicable to dwindling systems as well as tidally expanding orbits, and to the cases of initially retrograde motion. We present calculations for specific planet-moon systems (Earth and the Moon; Neptune and Triton; Venus and its hypothetical presently-extinct moon Neith; Mars, Phobos, and Deimos; Pluto and Charon), to constrain the dynamically plausible formation and evolution scenarios. Among other things, our analysis prompts the question of whether Pluto and Charon evolved into their current state from an initially more compact configuration (as is commonly assumed) or from a wider orbit -- a topic to be discussed at length elsewhere. Our results are equally applicable to exoplanets. For example, if asynchronous close-in exoplanets are detected, the possibility of tidal synchronisation by an exomoon should be considered.
#### Trends in the Population of Binary Black Holes Following the Fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog: a Data-Driven Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 Current population models of binary black hole distributions are difficult to interpret because standard population inferences hinge on modeling choices, which can mask or mimic real structure. The maximum population likelihood ``$\pistroke$ formalism'' provides a means to investigate and interpret features in the distribution of binary black holes using only data -- without specifying a population model. It tells us if features inferred from current population models are truly present in the data or if they arise from model misspecification. It also provides guidance for developing new models by highlighting previously unnoticed features. In this study, we utilize the $\pistroke$ formalism to examine the binary black hole population in the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4). Our analysis supports the existence of a gap around $45\,M_\odot$ in the secondary black hole mass distribution and identifies a widening in the distribution of the effective inspiral spin parameter $\chi_\text{eff}$ near this mass as recently reported by Tong et al. (2025). Similar to earlier studies, we find support for an anti-correlation between $\chi_\text{eff}$ and mass ratio. However, we argue that this may be a spurious correlation arising from misspecification of the joint distribution of black hole masses. Furthermore, we identify support for dimensionless black hole spin magnitudes at approximately $\chi \approx 0.2$ and $\chi\approx0.7$. The data support the existence of a correlation between the spin magnitudes $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$, though subsequent study is required to determine if this feature is statistically significant. The accompanying data release includes $\pistroke$ samples, which can be used to compare theoretical predictions to LVK data and to assess assumptions in parameterised models.
#### Kinematics of the lens host S0 galaxy NGC 1553: role of secular processes

 - **Abstract**
 We present an investigation of the central structure of the S0 galaxy NGC 1553, to understand its origin and the underlying dynamical processes that shape it. The high-resolution integral field spectroscopic data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) reveal a well-ordered rotation pattern, consisting of a rapidly rotating nuclear disc that is somewhat decoupled from the main disc, together with an inner lens; we collectively refer to these structures as the "disc-lens". The central peak in the velocity dispersion indicates the presence of a classical bulge. The nuclear disc is dynamically colder than the surrounding disc, while the lens is dynamically hotter. The higher-order Gauss-Hermite moments, $h_{3}$ and $h_{4}$, further characterise the stellar kinematics. An anti-correlation between the line-of-sight velocity and skewness ($h_{3}$) is consistent with regular rotation. In contrast, the ring-like enhancement in kurtosis ($h_{4}$) confirms the presence of the nuclear disc component. Unsharp masking of HST images (Erwin et al. 2015) reveals a nuclear bar and faint spiral structures within the central 10 arcsec, supporting the role of secular evolution. The mass-weighted stellar age map shows an old stellar population in the central regions, with high metallicity that suggests the in-situ formation of the disc-lens from disc material. We discuss possible formation scenarios for the disc-lens, including both minor mergers and secular processes, and examine the influence of the Dorado group environment on NGC 1553. Our findings suggest that the disc-lens in NGC 1553 formed during the early stages of the galaxy's evolution. However, its subsequent development has been shaped by internal and external processes. These results provide new insights into the origin and evolution of kinematically distinct substructures in S0 galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the aftermath of a giant quiescent solar filament eruption on December 24, 2023. One feature of the eruption is an extensive fan above the filament channel that is about three times as wide as similar structures that appear above active regions (ARs) during solar flares. The fan contains numerous supra-arcade downflows (SADs), and we investigate the largest SADs with continuous Hinode X-ray Telescope (XRT) observations. The measured maximum width of the SADs in this event is at least three times the maximum width of SADs observed in AR flares, whereas the velocities of the largest SADs are similar to the typical values of AR SADs. The kinetic characteristics of the largest SADs observed in this event align with previous model predictions, where SADs originate from the non-linear development of Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities. In this scenario, the larger system size allows the existence of larger-scale instabilities, while the development of the velocities of these instabilities is expected to be independent of the system size. Compared to AR flares, the temperature and emission measure in this event are lower, and there is less overall radiation, resulting in no evident Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) signature. Similar to those in AR flares, SADs show lower temperatures compared to the surrounding fan plasma. Our observations show that SADs are present in a wide variety of eruptions. The reconnection mechanisms present in quiescent filament eruptions are similar to those driving more compact eruptions originating from ARs.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries of dust and molecular gas in quiescent galaxies (QGs) up to $z\sim3$ challenge the long-standing view that the interstellar medium depletes rapidly once star formation ceases, raising key questions of whether dust and gas co-evolve in QGs, and how their depletion links to stellar aging. We present deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band~6 continuum and CO(3--2) observations of 17 QGs at $z\sim0.4$ in the COSMOS field. Using the dust-to-molecular gas mass ratio ($\delta_{\rm DGR}$) as a key diagnostic, we trace post-quenching evolution of the cold interstellar medium. Our study triples the number of QGs with direct $\delta_{\rm DGR}$ estimates, constraining 12 systems with stellar population ages of $\sim$5--10 Gyr. For the first time, we show that $\delta_{\rm DGR}$ in QGs ranges from $\sim8\times$ below to $\sim2.5\times$ above the canonical value of $\delta_{\rm DGR}\sim1/100$. Despite uniformly low molecular gas fractions (median $f_{\rm H_2}=M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\star}\sim4.1\%$), QGs follow diverse evolutionary paths: about half exhibit rapid ($\sim700$ Myr) exponential dust decline with age, while the rest show mild decline over $\gtrsim$2 Gyr, maintaining elevated $\delta_{\rm DGR}\gtrsim1/100$. Our results support simulations predictions of dust and molecular gas evolving independently post-quenching, without a preferred quenching mode. This challenges the use of dust continuum as a $\rm H_2$ tracer, implying that quenching cannot be robustly linked to interstellar medium conditions when relying solely on dust or gas.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray burst oscillations are quasi-coherent periodic signals at frequencies close to the neutron star spin frequency. They are observed during thermonuclear Type I X-ray bursts from a number of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) hosting a fast-spinning, weakly magnetic neutron star. Besides measuring the spin frequencies, burst oscillations hold the potential to accurately measure neutron star mass and radius, thus providing constraints on the equation of state of matter at nuclear densities. Based on far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations of the X-ray binary EXO 0748-676 taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2003, we report a possible indication of ultraviolet burst oscillations at the neutron star spin frequency ($\sim$552 Hz), potentially the first such case for an LMXB. The candidate signal is observed during an $\sim$8 s interval in the rising phase of an FUV burst, which occurred $\sim$4 s after a Type I X-ray burst. Through simulations, we estimated that the probability of detecting the observed signal power from pure random noise is 3.7$\%$, decreasing to 0.3$\%$ if only the burst rise interval is considered, during which X-ray burst oscillations had already been observed in this source. The background-subtracted folded pulse profile of the candidate FUV oscillations in the (120-160 nm) band is nearly sinusoidal with a $\sim$16$\%$ pulsed fraction, corresponding to a pulsed luminosity of $\sim$8$\times$10$^{33}$ erg/s. Interpreting the properties of this candidate FUV burst oscillations in the light of current models for optical-ultraviolet emission from neutron star LMXBs faces severe problems. If signals of this kind are confirmed in future observations, they might point to an unknown coherent emission process as the origin of the FUV burst oscillations observed in EXO 0748-676.
#### Impact of stochastic star-formation histories and dust on selecting quiescent galaxies with JWST photometry

 - **Abstract**
 While the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now allows identifying quiescent galaxies (QGs) out to early epochs, the photometric selection of quiescent galaxy candidates (QGCs) and the derivation of key physical quantities are highly sensitive to the assumed star-formation histories (SFHs). We aim to quantify how the inclusion of JWST/MIRI data and different SFH models impacts the selection and characterisation of QGCs. We test the robustness of the physical properties inferred from the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, such as M*, age, star formation rate (SFR), and AV, and study how they impact the quiescence criteria of the galaxies across cosmic time. We perform SED fitting for ~13000 galaxies at z<6 from the CEERS/MIRI fields with up to 20 optical-mid infrared (MIR) broadband coverage. We implement three SFH prescriptions: flexible delayed, NonParametric, and extended Regulator. For each model, we compare results obtained with and without MIRI photometry and dust emission models. We evaluate the impact of these configurations on the number of candidate QGCs, selected based on rest UVJ colours, sSFR and main-sequence offset, and on their key physical properties such as M*, AV, and stellar ages. The number of QGCs selected varies significantly with the choice of SFH from 171 to 224 out of 13000 galaxies, depending on the model. This number increases to 222-327 when MIRI data are used (up to ~45% more QGCs). This enhancement is driven by improved constraints on dust attenuation and M*. We find a strong correlation between AV and M*, with massive galaxies (M*~10^11 M\odot) being 1.5-4.2 times more attenuated in magnitude than low-mass systems (M*~10^9 M\odot), depending on SFH. Regardless of the SFH assumption, ~13% of QGCs exhibit significant attenuation (AV > 0.5) in support of recent JWST studies challenging the notion that quiescent galaxies are uniformly dust-free.
#### Towards Precision Cosmology With Improved PNLF Distances Using VLT-MUSE. III. Impact of Stellar Populations in Early-Type Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Distance measurements using the planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) rely on the bright-end power-law cut-off magnitude ($M^*$), which is defined by a number of the [OIII]$\lambda5007$-brightest planetary nebulae (PNe). In early-type galaxies (ETGs), the formation of these PNe is enigmatic; the population is typically too old to form the expected $M^*$ PNe from single star evolution. We aim to give a solution to this problem. We selected five ETGs with known MUSE-PNLF distances. The MUSE instrument allows us to calculate the PNLF and consistently investigate the underlying stellar populations. Using stellar population synthesis, we derive the population age, star formation history, metallicity, and alpha abundance. We compare these parameters to the PNLF variables: $M^*$ and luminosity-specific PN number at the top 0.5 mag of the PNLF ($\alpha_{0.5}$). We also compare our results with PNe In Cosmological Simulations (PICS) model applied to Magneticum Pathfinder analogue galaxies. The average mass-weighted ages and metallicities of our observations are typically old ($9 <\mathrm{Age}< 13.5$ Gyr) and rather metal-rich ($-0.4 <\mathrm{[M/H]}< +0.2$). We find $M^*$ to be independent of age and metallicity in these ages and metallicity intervals. We discover a positive correlation between $\alpha_{0.5}$ values and the mass fraction of stellar population ages of 2--10 Gyr, implying that most of the PNe originate from stars with intermediate ages. Similar trends are also found in the PICS analogue galaxies. We show that the presence of at least $\sim 2\%$ of stellar mass younger than 10 Gyr is, in principle, sufficient to form the $M^*$ PNe in ETGs. We also present observing requirements for an ideal PNLF distance determination in ETGs.

 - **Abstract**
 The energy equilibrium between the corona and the underlying disk in a two-phase accretion flow sets a lower limit on the achievable photon index. A slab corona may not explain the hard state observations of X-ray binaries (XRBs). We incorporate energy feedback to the accretion disk resulting from illumination by an extended corona, and vice versa. The interaction between these two components allows for the possibility of finding an energetically self-consistent equilibrium solution for a given disk-corona system. We have upgraded the existing Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, MONK, to incorporate the interaction between the disk and the extended corona within the general relativistic framework. We introduce an albedo parameter to specify the fraction of the incident flux that is reflected by the disk, while the remainder is absorbed and added to the intrinsic dissipation. Reflection is modeled assuming a semi-infinite electron atmosphere. We find global equilibrium solutions by iterating interaction between disk and extended slab corona. A higher black hole spin, higher coronal temperature, and higher albedo all lead to harder spectra. For typical coronal temperatures and disk albedo, the lowest achievable photon index with a static slab corona fully covering the disk is approximately 1.7-1.8. With the upgraded version of MONK, we are now able to achieve global energy equilibrium for a given disk-corona system. This approach holds significant potential for constraining the coronal geometry using not only the observed flux but also polarization. A static slab does not appear to be a favorable coronal geometry for the hard state of XRBs, even when global energy balance is taken into account. In future work, we will explore truncated disk geometries and outflowing coronae as potential alternatives. (shortened)

 - **Abstract**
 X-rays emitted by high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and supernovae-driven winds in the first galaxies during Cosmic Dawn are expected to warm the intergalactic medium prior to its reionization. While most of the heating will be uniform on measurable scales, exceptionally bright sources will produce a warm ring around them with a distinctive 21-cm signature. The detection of such systems would confirm X-rays are a source of IGM heating during Cosmic Dawn and provide a test of models predicting higher X-ray luminosities per star formation rate compared with present-day galaxies. We illustrate the effect for a star-forming galaxy in a $10^{11}\, M_\odot$ halo at $z=12$, treating the photoionizing radiation and X-rays using a novel fully time-dependent 3D ray-tracing radiative transfer code. We consider a range in possible spectra for the HMXBs and star formation efficiencies, as well as the possible effect of an extended halo around the galaxy. We find detection of the signal would require integration times of a few thousand hours using SKA1-Low except for a bright galaxy like a starburst, but only a thousand hours for the expected noise levels of SKA2-Low. Depending on the surrounding gas density profile, the 21-cm signature of X-ray heating may still require an exceptionally high star formation rate, either intrinsic to the source or provided by other systems clustered near it, to avoid dominance of the signal by absorption from the surrounding gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy evolution theories require co-evolution between accreting supermassive black holes (SMBH) and galaxies to explain many properties of the local galaxy population, yet observational evidence for the mechanisms driving this co-evolution is lacking. The recent star-formation histories of the host galaxies of accreting SMBHs (Active Galactic Nuclei, AGNs) can help constrain the processes that feed SMBHs and halt star formation in galaxies, but are difficult to obtain for the most luminous AGNs (quasars). We introduce Mean-Field Independent Component Analysis (MFICA) to decompose quasar spectra and obtain recent star formation histories of their host galaxies. Applying MFICA to quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 Quasar Catalogue in the redshift range $0.16 \leq z \leq 0.76$, we find that 53 per cent of quasar host galaxies are star-forming, 17 per cent lie in the green-valley, while only 5 per cent are quiescent. This contrasts with 14, 11, and 74 per cent of a mass-matched control sample that are star-forming, green-valley, and quiescent, respectively. We find that $\sim25$ per cent of quasars are hosted by post-starburst galaxies, an excess of $28\pm1$ compared to our control sample. While the heterogeneity of recent star formation histories implies multiple SMBH feeding mechanisms, the excess of post-starburst host galaxies demonstrates the link between accreting SMBHs and a recent starburst followed by rapid quenching. Given that massive post-starburst galaxies are predominantly caused by gas-rich major mergers, our results indicate that $30-50$ per cent of quasars originate from merger-induced starbursts.

 - **Abstract**
 Jets from accreting black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRBs) are powerful outflows that release a large fraction of the accretion energy to the surrounding environment, providing a feedback mechanism that may alter the interstellar medium (ISM) properties. Studying accretion and feedback together enables estimates of matter and energy input/output around accreting BHs. We focus on the extended jet structures of the BH-XRB GRS1758-258. First seen in VLA data, these parsec-scale jets arise from jet-ISM interaction and show a Z-shaped morphology. Using the MeerKAT telescope we observed GRS1758-258 in L-band for a total exposure of 7 hr. Applying a calorimetry-based method developed for AGN and later used for XRBs, we estimated the properties of the jets and of the surrounding ISM. We detect a jet and counter-jet terminating in bow-shocks. Within the northern jet lobe we identify synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission, while the southern lobe is dominated by thermal emission. We measure ISM densities between 10-40 cm-3 across both jets, slightly lower in the northern region. The estimated ages of the two lobes range from 6-51 kyr. The time-averaged jet power lies between 4.4x10^33 and 3.3x10^36 erg/s, with differences between north and south likely due to different local ISM conditions. Comparing new MeerKAT with archival VLA data, we measured a proper motion of 130 mas/yr in a portion of the northern jet. Jet-ISM interaction structures on both sides of GRS1758-258 reveal different ISM properties. The comparison between these structures and those from other XRBs suggests that the lobes in GRS1758-258 are younger and may result from different jet activity phases. The time-averaged energy transferred to the environment is slightly lower than in other XRBs, consistent with the younger age of the lobes in GRS1758-258 relative to those of other systems.

 - **Abstract**
 There is a long-standing discussion in the astrophysical/astrochemical community as to the structure and morphology of dust grains in various astrophysical environments (e.g., interstellar clouds, protostellar envelopes, protoplanetary and debris disks, and the atmospheres of exoplanets). Typical grain models assume a compact dust core which becomes covered in a thick ice mantle in cold dense environments. In contrast, less compact cores are likely to exhibit porosity, leading to a pronounced increase in surface area with concomitant much thinner ice films and higher accessibility to the bare grain surface. Several laboratory experimental and theoretical studies have shown that this type of dust structure can have a marked effect on several physico-chemical processes, including adsorption, desorption, mobility, and reactivity of chemical species. Porous grains are thus thought to likely play a particularly important and wide-ranging astrochemical role. Herein, we clarify what is meant by porosity in relation to grains and grain agglomerates, assess the likely astrochemical effects of porosity and ask whether a fractal/porous structural/morphological description of dust grains is appropriate from an astronomical perspective. We provide evidence for high porosity from laboratory experiments and computational simulations of grains and their growth in various astrophysical environments. Finally, we assess the observational constraints and perspectives on cosmic dust porosity. Overall, our paper discusses the effects of including porosity in dust models and the need to use such models for future astrophysical, astrochemical and astrobiological studies involving surface or solid-state processes.

 - **Abstract**
 As the compact binary catalog continues to grow rapidly, developing and refining tests to probe the nature of compact objects is essential for a comprehensive understanding of both the observed data and the underlying astrophysics of the binary population. We investigate the effectiveness of spin-induced multipole moments (SIQM) and tidal deformability measurements in distinguishing lower mass-gap black hole (BH) binaries from non-BH binaries with different mass and spin configurations. We perform model-agnostic tests on binary BH (BBH) simulations using full Bayesian inference, evaluating the independent and joint measurability of SIQM and tidal parameters across the parameter space. We extend the analysis to simulations of self-interacting spinning boson stars, using synthetic signals that exhibit (a) both SIQM and tidal effects and (b) each effect individually. For case (a), recovery is performed using (i) a BBH model, (ii) a model incorporating both SIQM and tidal effects, and (iii) models including either SIQM or tidal effects. For case (b), we employ (i) a BBH model and (ii) models incorporating either SIQM or tidal effects, consistent with the injection. Simulations employ TaylorF2 waveform model and consider binaries in the low mass gap with varying spin magnitudes. We find that employing an incorrect model to analyze the signal can lead to biases in parameter inference. Notably, when analyzing a simulated binary boson star-like signal with component masses $\rm{(4, 4) \, M_{\odot}}$ using a BBH model, the system is incorrectly identified as having masses $\rm{(8, 2) \, M_{\odot}}$. In contrast, using the correct recovery model that includes both SIQM and tidal deformability effects successfully recovers the true masses, highlighting the significance of waveform model accuracy in performing reliable distinguishability tests for compact objects in the low-mass gap.

 - **Abstract**
 Star clusters are valuable indicators of galaxy evolution, offering insights into the buildup of stellar populations across cosmic time. Understanding intrinsic star cluster populations of dwarf galaxies is particularly important given their role in the hierarchical growth of larger systems. Using Euclid Early Release Observation data, we study star clusters in two star-forming dwarf irregulars in the Local Group, NGC 6822 and IC 10 [$M_\star \sim$ (1--4) $\times10^8 M_\odot$]. With Euclid, clusters are resolved into individual stars across the main bodies and haloes of both galaxies. Visual inspection of $I_E$ images uncovers 30 new cluster candidates in NGC 6822 and 16 in IC 10, from compact to extended clusters. We re-evaluate literature candidates, producing combined catalogues of 52 (NGC 6822) and 71 (IC 10) clusters with confidence-based classifications. We present homogeneous photometry in $I_E$, $Y_E$, $J_E$, $H_E$, and archival UBVRI data, alongside size measurements and properties from BAGPIPES SED fitting. Synthetic cluster injection shows our sample is $\sim 50$% complete to $M \lesssim 10^3 M_\odot$ for ages $\lesssim 100$ Myr, and to $M \lesssim 3\times10^4 M_\odot$ for $\sim 10$ Gyr. IC 10 has more young clusters than NGC 6822, extending to higher masses, consistent with its starburst nature. Both dwarfs host several old massive ($\gtrsim 10^5 M_\odot$) clusters, including an exceptional $1.3 \times 10^6 M_\odot$ cluster in NGC 6822's outskirts. In NGC 6822, we identify a previously undetected, old, extended cluster ($R_h = 12.4 \pm 0.11$ pc). Using well-defined criteria, we identify 11 candidate GCs in NGC 6822 and eight in IC 10. Both galaxies have high specific frequencies ($S_N$) but remain consistent with known GC scaling relations at low luminosity.
