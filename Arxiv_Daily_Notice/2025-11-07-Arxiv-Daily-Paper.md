#### Dynamical Friction Constraints on the Dark Matter Hypothesis Across Astronomical Scales

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamical friction implies a consistency check on any system where dark matter particles are hypothesised to explain orbital dynamics requiring more mass under Newtonian gravity than is directly detectable. Introducing the assumption of a dominant dark matter halo will also imply a decay timescale for the orbits in question. A self-consistency constraint hence arises, such that the resulting orbital decay timescales must be longer than the lifetimes of the systems in question. While such constraints are often trivially passed, the combined dependencies of dynamical friction timescales on the mass and orbital radius of the orbital tracer and on the density and velocity dispersion of the assumed dark matter particles leads to the existence of a number of astronomical systems where such a consistency test is failed. Here, we review cases from stars in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, galactic bars, satellite galaxies, and, particularly, the multi-period mutual orbits of the Magellanic Clouds, as recently inferred from the star formation histories of these two galaxies, as well as the nearby M81 group of galaxies, where introducing enough dark matter to explain observed kinematics leads to dynamical friction orbital decay timescales shorter than the lifetimes of the systems in question. Taken together, these observations exclude dark matter halos made of particles as plausible explanations for the observed kinematics of these systems.

 - **Abstract**
 It is widely believed that the ultraviolet background produced during the epoch of reionization conspires against the formation of low-mass galaxies. Indeed, this mechanism is often invoked as a solution to the so-called `missing satellites problem.' In this paper we employ FIREbox, a large-volume cosmological simulation based on the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) physics model, to characterize the mechanisms governing galaxy ignition in the post-reionization era. By carefully matching recently-ignited halos (with stellar ages below $100$ Myr) to halos that failed to form any stars, we conclude that the presence of cold-dense gas and halo concentration help incite the process of galaxy formation. Concretely, we find that $100\%$ of recently-ignited halos experience cold-dense gas enhancements relative to their matched failed counterparts. Likewise, approximately $83\%$ display enhancements in both cold-dense gas and Navarro-Frenk-White concentration ($c_{\rm NFW}$), while the remaining $\sim17\%$ exhibit enhanced cold-dense gas content and suppressed $c_{\rm NFW}$ values. Lastly, our simulation suggests that galaxy ignition can occur as late as $z=2$, potentially allowing us to observationally catch this process `in the act' in the forseeable future.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telecope (JWST) opened a new window for the study of the highest redshift ($z>7$) Universe. This work presents a theoretical investigation of the very-high redshift Universe using the state-of-the-art GALaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) model, run on merger trees from the Planck-Millennium $N$-body simulation. We show that GAEA successfully reproduces a wide range of high-$z$ observational estimates including: the galaxy stellar mass function up to $z\sim13$ and the total (galaxies and AGN) UV luminosity function (LF) up to $z\sim10$. We find that the AGN UV emission represents an important contribution at the bright end of the UVLF up to $z\sim8$, but it is negligible at higher redshift. Our model reproduces well the observed mass-metallicity relation at $z\leq4$, while it slightly overestimates the normalization of the relation at earlier cosmic epochs. At $z\geq11$, current UVLF estimates are at least one order of magnitude larger than model predictions. We investigate the impact of different physical mechanisms, such as an enhanced star formation efficiency coupled with a reduced stellar feedback or a negligible stellar feedback at $z>10$. In the framework of our model, both the galaxy stellar mass and UV luminosity functions at $z\geq10$ can be explained by assuming feedback-free starbursts in high-density molecular clouds. However, we show that this model variant leads to a slight increase of the normalization of the $z\geq10$ mass-metallicity relation, strengthening the tension with available data. A model with negligible stellar feedback at $z>10$ also predicts larger numbers of massive and bright galaxies aligning well with observations, but it also overestimates the metallicity of the interstellar medium. We show that these model variants can in principle be discriminated using the relation between the star formation rate and galaxy stellar mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Gas accretion, hot ($\sim 10^6\,{\rm K}$) atmospheres, and a tilt between the rotation axes of the disc and the atmosphere are all robust predictions of standard cosmology for massive star-forming galaxies at low redshift. Using idealized hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate that the central regions of hot galaxy atmospheres continuously condense into cool ($\sim10^4\,{\rm K}$) discs, while being replenished by an inflow from larger scales. The size and orientation of the condensed disc are determined by the angular momentum of the atmosphere, so it is large and often tilted with respect to the pre-existing galaxy disc. Continuous smooth accretion from hot atmospheres can thus both provide the necessary fuel for star formation and explain the observed ubiquity of extended and warped HI discs around local spirals. In this hot accretion scenario, cool gas observations cannot be used to trace the source of the HI, warps out to halo radii, consistent with recent indications of a lack of $21\,{\rm cm}$ emission from the halos of nearby galaxies (the `HI desert'). Observations of HI warps formed via hot accretion can be used to constrain the angular momentum, accretion rate, and gas metallicity of hot galaxy atmospheres, important parameters for disc galaxy evolution that are hard to determine by other means.
#### Spectral Diversity in Type Ibn Supernovae and the Large Host Offset of SN2024acyl

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we first present observations of SN~2024acyl, a normal Type Ibn supernova with a large projected offset ($\sim$35~kpc) from its host galaxy. The low star-formation rate measured at the explosion site raises the possibility that the progenitor of SN~2024acyl may not have been a massive star. We then examine, more broadly, the spectral diversity of Type Ibn supernovae around 20--35 days after peak brightness and identify two distinct groups: Group I, which shows bluer rest-frame optical color and narrower He~I emission lines; and Group II, which shows redder rest-frame optical color and broader He~I lines. Group~I also tends to show higher peak luminosities. The diversity we identify appears to be closely connected to the diversity observed around peak and to persist into late phases ($>80$ days after peak). Given its redder color and broader He~I lines, we classify SN~2024acyl as belonging to Group II. Based on the current dataset, we find no clear connection between this spectral diversity and either the host environments of Type Ibn SNe or their pre-explosion activity. The observed diversity in Type Ibn SNe likely reflects differences in circumstellar material properties and/or explosion energetics. These differences could result from a range of progenitor properties, such as different helium star mass, orbital period and companion type if they are in binary systems, and may indicate fundamentally diverse progenitors. Whether a continuous distribution exists between the two groups remains to be determined and will require further data to explore.
#### Early evidence for isotropic planetary obliquities in young super-Jupiter systems

 - **Abstract**
 This decade has seen the first measurements of extrasolar planetary obliquities, characterizing how an exoplanet's spin axis is oriented relative to its orbital axis. These measurements are enabled by combining projected rotational velocities, planetary rotation periods, and astrometric orbits for directly-imaged super-Jupiters. This approach constrains both the spin axis and orbital inclination relative to the line of sight, allowing obliquity measurements for individual systems and offering new insights into their formation. To test whether these super-Jupiters form more like scaled-up planets or scaled-down stars, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer their population-level obliquity distribution. Using a single-parameter Fisher distribution, we compare two models: a planet-like formation scenario ($\kappa=5$) predicting moderate alignment, versus a brown dwarf-like formation scenario ($\kappa=0$) predicting isotropic obliquities. Based on a sample of four young super-Jupiter systems, we find early evidence favoring the isotropic case with a Bayes factor of 15, consistent with turbulent fragmentation.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence plays a central role in many astrophysical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM), including star formation, heat conduction, and cosmic-ray scattering. MHD turbulence can be decomposed into three fundamental modes-fast, slow, and Alfvén-each contributing differently to the dynamics of the medium. However, characterizing and separating the energy fractions of these modes was challenging due to the limited information available from observations. To address this difficulty, we use 3D isothermal and multiphase MHD turbulence simulations to examine how mode energy fractions vary under different physical conditions. Overall, we find that the Alfvén and slow modes carry comparable kinetic-energy fractions and together dominate the turbulent energy budget in multiphase media, while the fast mode contributes the smallest fraction. Relative to isothermal conditions, multiphase simulations exhibit an enhanced fast-mode energy fraction. We further introduce a machine-learning-based approach that employs a conditional Residual Neural Network to infer these fractions directly from spectroscopic data. The method leverages the fact that the three MHD modes imprint distinct morphological signatures in spectroscopic maps owing to their differing anisotropies and compressibilities. Our model is trained on a suite of isothermal and multiphase simulations covering typical ISM conditions. We further demonstrate that our machine learning model can robustly recover the mode fractions from spectroscopic observables, achieving mean absolute errors of approximately 0.05 for seen data and 0.1 for unseen data.

 - **Abstract**
 Most of the physical information about astrophysical objects is obtained via the analysis of their electromagnetic spectra. Observed data coupled with radiation transfer models in physical conditions representative of stars, planets, kilonovae, and ISM, yield constrains on their physical structure, gas flow dynamics at the surface, mass loss, and detailed chemical composition of the systems. All these core astrophysical parameters are just as reliable as the physical quality of the models that are employed for simulations of radiation transfer. Recent advances in multi-D transfer modeling with Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) in inhomogeneous time-dependent systems revealed systematic shortcomings of canonical models. Owing to major complexities of solving coupled multi-frequency RT equations in 3D geometry, a number of approximations have been introduced. This review presents an overview of the physical problem, standard solutions, and recent methodological advances. We also provide an overview of main results in the area of 3D NLTE radiation transfer and its applications to modeling diverse astrophysical environments, including FGKM type- and OBA-type stars, multi-epoch spectra of kilonovae, and atmospheres of rocky and gaseous exoplanets.
#### The Initial mass function of field stars with mass $\leq$ 1 $M_{\odot}$ varies with metallicity

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated a volume-limited sample of LAMOST main-sequence stars with masses from 0.25 to 1 $M_{\odot}$ and distances of 150-350 pc to explore how the stellar initial mass function (IMF) varies with metallicity. We corrected the spectroscopic selection function by comparing the stellar number densities with the photometric ones at the same colour and magnitude. From these corrected number density distributions, we derived IMFs for each metallicity sub-samples. Fitting a broken power-law function in each IMF with a fixed break point at 0.525 $M_{\odot}$, we found the power-law indices increase with [Fe/H] for both mass regimes: $\alpha_1$ (mass $\leq$ 0.525 $M_{\odot}$) rises from 0.54 $\pm$ 0.21 to 1.40 $\pm$ 0.07 and $\alpha_2$ (mass>0.525 $M_{\odot}$) grows from 1.40 $\pm$ 0.16 to 1.86 $\pm$ 0.04 as [Fe/H] varies from -1 to +0.5 dex. It demonstrates that low-mass stars make up a larger fraction in metal-rich environments than in metal-poor ones. We performed simulations to assess the impact of unresolved binaries on the IMF power-law indices. After correction, the binary-adjusted $\alpha$ values retained a similar metallicity-dependent trend. Furthermore, by examining the IMF of the aggregate sample, we found the corrected indices ($\alpha_{\rm{1,corr}} = 1.48 \pm 0.03$ , $\alpha_{\rm{2,corr}} = 2.17 \pm 0.03$) are consistent with Kroupa's IMF values ($\alpha_1 = 1.3 \pm 0.5$ and $\alpha_2 = 2.3 \pm 0.3$). Finally, we verified the robustness of our results by testing different break points and mass bin sizes, confirming that the IMF's dependence on [Fe/H] remains consistent.

 - **Abstract**
 Thanks to a recent observation with XMM-Newton, we discovered periodic pulsations at P= 9.6652 +/- 0.0002 s in a new ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in the galaxy NGC 4631. This source, dubbed as X-8, shows one of the largest spin-up rates ever observed, dP/dt = (-9.6 +/- 0.5)*1E-8 s/s. These findings indicate that the compact object is a neutron star, and X-8 is a new member of the pulsating ULX class. The 0.3-10 keV luminosity of X-8 is ~3.4E39 erg/s, and its X-ray spectrum can be described by an absorbed disk blackbody or a cut-off power law, similar to what is observed in other pulsating ULXs. We discuss two possible causes for the large spin-up rate: Doppler shift from orbital motion of the neutron star and intrinsic spin-up due to accretion torque. This new ULX pulsar adds a key source to the small known population, and will enable future studies to better constrain the physical mechanisms responsible for their super-Eddington luminosities.

 - **Abstract**
 In addition to comprehensive surveys of the Milky Way bulge, disk, and halo, the Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) project observed seven dwarf spheroidal satellites (dSphs) of the Milky Way: Carina, Sextans, Sculptor, Draco, Ursa Minor, Bootes 1, and Fornax. APOGEE radial velocities, stellar parameters, and Gaia EDR3 proper motions are used to identify member stars in the vicinity of each dwarf. To properly analyze the abundance patterns of these galaxies, a novel procedure was developed to determine the measurable upper limits of the APOGEE chemical abundances as a function of the effective temperature and the spectral signal-to-noise ratio. In general, the APOGEE abundance patterns of these galaxies (limited to [Fe/H] $>$ -2.5) agree with those found in high-resolution optical studies after abundance offsets are applied. Most of the galaxies studied have abundance patterns that are distinctly different from the majority of stars found in the MW halo, suggesting that these galaxies contributed little to the MW halo above [Fe/H] $>$ -2.0. From these abundance patterns, we find that these dSphs tend to follow two types of chemical evolution paths: episodic and continuous star formation, a result that is consistent with previous photometric studies of their star formation histories. We explore whether mass and/or environment have an impact on whether a galaxy has an episodic or continuous star formation history, finding evidence that, in addition to the galaxy's mass, proximity to a larger galaxy and the cessation of star formation may drive the overall shape of the chemical evolution.
#### How the gradient of $M_{\rm d}$ versus UV field strength yields insights into the ages of protoplanetary disc populations

 - **Abstract**
 FUV radiation from massive stars launch photoevaporative winds from the outer regions of protoplanetary discs around other stars, removing gas and dust. Observations have identified a relation between the median dust disc mass and the external UV field strength. Here we use disc evolutionary models to explore how this relation evolves over time, and with respect to other stellar and disc properties. We find that the slope for the relationship $\lambda_{\rm UV}$ flattens over time as populations age, possibly explaining the differences seen between the L1641-N and L1641-S clusters in Orion A. We determine that $\lambda_{\rm UV}$ depends on the stellar mass where more massive stars exhibit steeper gradients than their lesser counterparts, in agreement with the differences seen between Herbig and T Tauri stars. Additionally, the strength of the mechanism for angular momentum transport, either viscosity or MHD disc winds, is found to significantly affect $\lambda_{\rm UV}$ with stronger $\alpha$ values reducing $\lambda_{\rm UV}$ due to more material accreting on to the central stars in weaker UV environments. Estimates of $\lambda_{\rm UV}$ from observations of L1641 place preliminary constraints on $\alpha$ to be between $10^{-3.5}$--$10^{-2.5}$, consistent with literature estimates. Further observations in different regions and better classifications of stellar masses will allow us to place stringent constraints on disc evolution properties, improving our understanding of how protoplanetary discs evolve.
#### Dust Collisions in Protoplanetary Disks: Atomic Simulations of the Surface Free Energy

 - **Abstract**
 Coagulation of dust particles in protoplanetary disks is the first step on the journey to the formation of planets. The surface free energy (SFE) of the dust particles determines the effectiveness of particles sticking to each other after collision, as well as the critical collision velocity above which fragmentation will occur. Studies of SFE have focused on the simplest silicate, silica, usually at standard temperature and pressure. However, protoplanetary dust grains have a wide variety of mineralogical compositions, temperatures, and a low-pressure environment lacking in water vapor. We perform molecular dynamics simulations using a ReaxFF-type potential of the SFE of silica, albite, and anorthite at temperatures ranging from 30 to 700 K in a true vacuum. We find that the SFE drops by tens of percent with increasing temperature or shifting to more complex silicate compositions. More dramatically, we find that the values of the SFE in a vacuum are two orders of magnitude higher than those usually measured in terrestrial laboratories. Our results confirm previous work that suggests that hydroxylation by monolayers of water produces this reduction in SFE in experiments. The coagulation of dust grains thus appears to depend critically on the cleanliness of their surfaces, as well as their temperature and composition.

 - **Abstract**
 The Euclid Quick Data Release 1 (Q1) encompasses 30 million sources across 63.1 square degrees, marking the beginning of petabyte-scale data delivery through Data Release 1 (DR1) and subsequent releases. Systematic exploitation of such datasets requires extracting millions of source-specific cutouts, yet standard tools like Astropy's Cutout2D process sources individually, creating bottlenecks for large catalogues. We introduce Cutana, a memory-efficient software tool optimised for batch processing in both local and cloud-native environments. Cutana employs vectorised NumPy operations to extract cutout batches simultaneously from FITS tiles, implements automated memory-aware scheduling, and supports both Zarr and FITS output formats with multiple common normalisation schemes (asinh, log, zscale). Cutana outperforms Astropy in all tested Q1 subset scenarios achieving near linear scaling and processing thousands of cutouts per second. On just four worker threads, Cutana can process all of Q1 in under four hours. The tool includes an ipywidget interface for parameter configuration and real-time monitoring. Integration with ESA Datalabs is underway for the Euclid DR1 release, with open-source release pending ESA open-source licensing processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations from JWST have revealed unexpectedly luminous galaxies, exhibiting stellar masses and luminosities significantly higher than predicted by theoretical models at Cosmic Dawn. In this study, we present a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations targeting high-redshift ($z \geq 10$) galaxies with dark matter halo masses in the range $10^{10} - 10^{11}\ {\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$, using state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulation codes (Enzo, Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gadget-4, and Gizmo). This study aims to evaluate the convergence of the participating codes and their reproducibility of high-redshift galaxies with the galaxy formation model calibrated at relatively low redshift, without additional physics for high-redshift environments. The subgrid physics follows the AGORA CosmoRun framework, with adjustments to resolution and initial conditions to emulate similar physical environments in the early universe. The participating codes show consistent results for key galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass), but also reveal notable differences (e.g., metallicity), indicating that galaxy properties at high redshifts are highly sensitive to the feedback implementation of the simulation. Massive halos (${\rm M}_{\rm halo}\geq5\times10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$) succeed in reproducing observed stellar masses, metallicities, and UV luminosities at $10\leq z\leq12$ without requiring additional subgrid physics, but tend to underpredict those properties at higher redshift. We also find that varying the dust-to-metal ratio modestly affects UV luminosity of simulated galaxies, whereas the absence of dust significantly enhances it. In future work, higher-resolution simulations will be conducted to better understand the formation and evolution of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study on the physical and chemical structures of a chemically rich bipolar outflow in a high-mass star forming region IRAS 16272$-$4837 (SDC335), utilizing high-resolution spectral line data at 1.3 mm and 3 mm dual-bands from the ALMA ATOMS and QUARKS surveys. The high-velocity jet is enveloped by a lower-velocity outflow cavity, containing bright knots that show enhanced molecular intensities and elevated excitation temperatures. Along the outflow, we have identified 35 transitions from 22 molecular species. By analyzing the spatial distribution and kinematics of these molecular lines, we find that the molecular inventory in the outflow is regulated by three processes: (i) direct entrainment from the natal molecular core by the outflow; (ii) shock-induced release of molecules or atoms from dust grains; and (iii) thermal desorption and gas-phase reactions driven by shock heating. These results confirm that outflows are not only dynamical structures but also active chemical factories, where entrainment, shocks, and thermal processing jointly enrich the molecular content. Our findings confirmed that outflow chemistry has multi-origin nature, and provide critical insights into chemical evolution during high-mass star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The atmospheres of massive O-type stars (O stars) are dynamic, turbulent environments resulting from radiatively driven instabilities over the iron bump, located slightly beneath the stellar surface. Here, complex radiation hydrodynamic processes affect the structure of the atmosphere as well as the formation of spectral lines. In quantitative spectroscopic analysis, the effects of these processes are often parametrized with ad hoc techniques and values. This work is aimed at exploring how variation of basic atmospheric parameters affects the dynamics within the subsurface turbulent zone. We also explore how this turbulence relates to absorption lines formed in the photosphere for a broad range of O stars at solar metallically. The work in this paper centers around a grid of 2D, radiation-hydrodynamic O-star atmosphere and wind simulations, where the turbulent region is an emergent property of the simulation. For each of the 36 models in the grid, we derived the turbulent properties and correlated them to an estimate of turbulent line broadening imposed by the models' velocity fields. Our work suggests that the subphotospheric turbulent velocity in O-stars scales approximately with the square of the Eddington arameter, $\Gamma_{\rm e}$. We also find a linear correlation between subphotospheric turbulent velocity and the line broadening of several synthetic photospheric absorption lines. Radiation carries more energy than advection throughout the atmosphere for all models in the grid; however, for O-type supergiants, the latter can account for up to 30 \% of the total flux at the peak of the iron bump.

 - **Abstract**
 The coexistence of PAHs and the C$_{60}$ fullerene in different astrophysical environments can give rise to the formation of new complex species denoted as PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts, which may contribute to the infrared (IR) emission observed. These PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts have been previously reported experimentally due to the high reactivity between PAHs and C$_{60}$. From the astrophysical point of view, however, they have not been considered in detail yet. Here we have performed a combined experimental and theoretical study in order to characterize the IR spectra of PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts, including multiple adducts. By using new advanced experimental techniques, we have been able to synthesize some specific PAH-C$_{60}$ adduct isomers, and measured their IR spectra. These experimental data are used to correct their harmonic scaled spectra, as obtained from quantum-chemistry calculations performed at the DFT level under the B3LYP-GD3/6-31+G(d) approach. This way, we simulate the IR ($\sim$3$-$25 $\mu$m) spectra of multiple PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts, composed by a different number of PAH units: mostly one or two units. In addition, the chemical kinetics data available in the literature are used to tentatively estimate the possible order of magnitude of the abundances of these PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts using the available observational data. Essentially, our results reveal a possible strong modification of the IR spectra when astronomically estimated abundances are considered. Several spectral peculiarities are observed, such as a broad $\sim$3.4-3.6 $\mu$m feature, and important modifications in the 6-10 and 12-16 $\mu$m spectral regions together with contributions to the C$_{60}$ features at 7.0 and 18.9 $\mu$m. Interestingly, these PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts lack aliphatic CH bonds, but they display IR features around 3.4 $\mu$m, challenging previous interpretations of this astronomical feature.

 - **Abstract**
 Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) provides high angular resolution images and has been used for stellar astrometry for decades. The DYNAMO-VLBA project utilizes the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) to study tight binary and multiple pre-main sequence stars, whose components have detectable radio emission and typical separations on the order of milli-arcseconds. Such systems cannot be resolved by Gaia, making VLBI an essential tool for the study of their orbital parameters and, eventually, the determination of their mass. Here, we report VLBA dynamical mass measurements of the individual stars in the S1 system in Ophiuchus and EC\,95 in Serpens. S1 is the most luminous and massive stellar member of the nearby Ophiuchus star-forming region. We find that the primary component, S1A, has a mass of $4.11 \pm 0.10\,M_{\odot}$. This is significantly less than the value of $\sim6\,M_{\odot}$ expected from theoretical models given the location of S1A on the HR diagram. The secondary, S1B, has a mass of $0.831 \pm 0.014\,M_{\odot}$ and is most likely a T Tauri star. In the Serpens triple system EC\,95, we measure the masses of EC\,95A and EC\,95B, finding $2.15\pm0.10$ M$_\odot$ and $2.00\pm0.12$ M$_\odot$, respectively. In this case, the measured masses agree with the location of the stars in the HR diagram for very young 2 $M_\odot$ stars. For the first time, we also estimated the mass of tertiary, EC\,95C, to be 0.26 $^{+0.53}_{-0.46}$ M$_\odot$.
