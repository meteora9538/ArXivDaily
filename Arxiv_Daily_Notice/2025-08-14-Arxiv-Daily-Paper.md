 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanets with and without a magnetic field are predicted to form, behave, and evolve very differently. Therefore, there is great need to directly constrain these fields to holistically understand the properties of exoplanets including their potential habitability. This goal aligns with the Astro2020 Decadal Survey recommendations. Observing planetary auroral radio emissions is among the most promising detection methods, but decades of searching have yet to yield a conclusive detection, though promising hints are now emerging from ground-based radio telescopes. However, these ground-based efforts are fundamentally limited by Earth's ionosphere, which blocks the low-frequency signals (<10 MHz) expected from terrestrial and Neptune-like exoplanets. In this white paper, we outline a strategy to overcome this barrier by utilizing the unique environment of the Moon. We discuss how the upcoming LuSEE-Night and ROLSES pathfinder missions will study our Solar System's planets as exoplanet analogs and place the first meaningful upper limits on exoplanetary radio flux below 10 MHz. Furthermore, we explore the revolutionary potential of the proposed future lunar arrays FarView and FARSIDE. For example, FarView will be sensitive enough to study the magnetic fields of a diverse set of exoplanets (super-Earths to gas giants) and an order of magnitude more Jupiter-like planets than ground-based telescopes, providing crucial tests for dynamo theory. Most significantly, FARSIDE will be able to detect the magnetospheres of nearby terrestrial exoplanets, offering a powerful synergy with atmospheric characterization efforts by JWST and HWO to fully assess their potential habitability. By opening this unexplored low-frequency window, radio astronomy from the Moon is poised to transform the field of exoplanet magnetospheric science. [Abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 Extremely metal-poor (XMP) galaxies are systems with gas-phase oxygen abundances below $\sim$5% Solar metallicity (12+log(O/H)$\le$7.35). These galaxies populate the metal-poor end of the mass-metallicity and luminosity-metallicity relations (MZR and LZR, respectively). Recent studies have found XMP galaxies in the nearby Universe to be outliers on the LZR, where they show enhanced luminosities relative to other galaxies of similar gas-phase oxygen abundance. Here, we present a study of the recently discovered XMP galaxy Leonessa and characterize the system's properties using new imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope and spectra from the Green Bank Telescope and Hobby-Eberly Telescope. We use these observations to measure a tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distance (15.86$\pm$0.78 Mpc) to Leonessa, the HI gas mass, the gas-phase oxygen abundance, and N/O ratio. We find Leonessa is an isolated, gas rich (gas fraction $\mu$=0.69), low-mass (log(M$_\star$/M$_\odot$)=6.12$\pm$0.08), XMP (12+log(O/H)=7.32$\pm$0.04), star-forming galaxy at a distance of 15.86$\pm$0.78 Mpc. Our measurements show that Leonessa agrees with the MZR, but disagrees with the LZR; we conclude the LZR offset is due to recent star formation enhancing the system's luminosity. To investigate possible chemical evolution pathways for nearby XMP galaxies we also compile a comparison sample of 150 dwarf galaxies (53 XMP systems) taken from the literature with gas-phase metallicity measurements based on the direct method. We find evidence for an anti-correlation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and HI gas-to-stellar mass ratios. We posit Leonessa is undergoing a chemical evolution pathway typical of field dwarf galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 There are several puzzling phenomena from recent JWST observations, which seem to push the standard {\Lambda}CDM cosmology over the edge. All those puzzles can be understood in a coherent way if we assume that first massive black holes (MBHs, the "heavy eggs") formed by directly collapsing from wave CDM haloes, which can be even earlier than the formation of first galaxies (the "chickens"). We elucidate two false obstacles that have been believed to prevent wave CDM haloes from collapsing into black holes (namely "maximum stable mass" and "bosenova") and point out that general-relativistic instabilities (e.g., the non-axisymmetric instability numerically found in spinning scalar-field boson stars) could serve as the concrete mechanisms for direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) born from wave dark matter. Once the MBHs formed, star formation bursts in and around the accretion flows, characteristic of a special mode in compact regions of high gravitational accelerations.
#### Primordial planet spin driven by boundary layer effects in a decretion disc

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion of material from a protoplanetary disc on to a forming giant planet can spin the planet up to close to its breakup rate, $\Omega_{\rm b}=(G M_{\rm p}/R_{\rm p}^3)$, where $M_{\rm p}$ is the mass and $R_{\rm p}$ is the radius of the planet. After the protoplanetary disc dissipates, the rapidly rotating planet may eject a decretion (outflowing) disc in a similar way to a Be star. Boundary layer effects in a hydrodynamic disc allow for decretion disc formation at spin rates below the breakup spin rate of the planet. The decretion disc exerts a torque on the planet that slows its spin to an equilibrium value that is sensitive to the planet temperature. By considering steady state circumplanetary decretion disc solutions, we show that the equilibrium spin rate for planets is around $0.4\,\Omega_{\rm b}$ for $H/R=0.2$ and around $0.2\,\Omega_{\rm b}$ for $H/R=0.3$, where $H$ is the disc scale height at radius $R$. These values are in line with the spins of the giant planets in the solar system and observed exoplanet spins.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting Population III (Pop. III) stars remains a major observational challenge. Their Balmer series recombination line emission, redshifted into the infrared at $z \sim 5-11$, is a potential tracer. JWST/NIRSpec offers the first opportunity to detect such lines, provided fluxes exceed instrumental sensitivity. This study aims to model the expected luminosities of the first four Balmer series transitions from Pop. III star-forming halos and assess their detectability with JWST/NIRSpec across $5 \leq z \leq 11$. We use the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH with merger trees constructed from the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism and cosmological N-body simulations targeting Milky Way-like halos and the halo population in a 8~Mpc$/h$ box. Predicted fluxes are compared to JWST detection limits derived from the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) assuming a 10,000 s NIRSpec exposure at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5. For our default model parameters, Pop. III H$\alpha$ fluxes peak at $\sim10^{-21}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, 2-3 orders of magnitude below the JWST detection threshold ($\sim6 \times 10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$). The fluxes in the other Balmer series lines are weaker than H$\alpha$ and hence are also not detectable. Among the model parameters that we explore, the ionizing photon escape fraction $f_{\mathrm{esc,III}}$ has the strongest effect on Pop. III Balmer series fluxes when changed: reducing $f_\mathrm{esc,III}$ from 0.9 to 0.1 increases the fluxes by $\gtrsim$1 order of magnitude. However, even in this case, the lines remain undetectable. Balmer series lines powered by emission from Pop. III stars will be undetectable by JWST without strong lensing ($\mu \gtrsim 10$). A-SLOTH provides a useful tool to predict emission strengths and assess the detectability of Pop. III stars across cosmic history.
#### Stingrays in the radio sky: Two unusual diffuse radio relic sources in the direction of the Magellanic Stream

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of two extended, low surface brightness radio continuum sources, each consisting of a near-circular body and an extended tail of emission, nicknamed Stingray 1 (ASKAP J0129-5350) and Stingray 2 (ASKAP J0245-5642). Both are found in the direction of the Magellanic Stream (MS) and were discovered in the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey at 944 MHz. We combine the ASKAP data with low-frequency radio observations from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA Survey (GLEAM) to conduct a radio continuum analysis. We explore both Galactic/near Galactic scenarios, including runaway or circumgalactic supernova remnants (SNRs) and parentless pulsar-wind nebulae (PWNe), and extragalactic scenarios including radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs), dying radio galaxies, galaxy clusters, galaxy pairs or groups, head-tail radio galaxies, and Odd Radio Circles (ORCs), as well as the possibility that the morphology is due to a chance alignment. The Stingrays exhibit non-thermal emission with spectral indices of $\alpha$ = -0.89 $\pm$ 0.09 for Stingray 1 and $\alpha$ = -1.77 $\pm$ 0.06 for Stingray 2. We find that none of the proposed scenarios can explain all of the observed properties, however we determine it most likely that their shape is caused by some kind of complex environmental interaction. The most likely scenario from the available data is that of a head-tail radio galaxy, but more data is required for a definitive classification.
#### Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect in the circumgalactic medium -- II: dependence on star formation

 - **Abstract**
 We measure thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) Effect in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of $\approx$2.5 million $\rm M_{200}$=$\rm 10^{12-14}\,M_\odot$ WISE$\times$DESI galaxies out to $z$=1.2. We split the sample into quiescent (0.7 million) and star-forming (1.8 million) galaxies, exploring the relation between the thermal pressure of the CGM and star formation for the first time. We develop and implement a novel probabilistic approach to cross-correlate the galaxy catalog with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope+Planck data by taking into account the uncertainties in redshift, mass, and star formation rate. The S/N of the stacked Compton-$y$ value in the CGM varies from 4.9 to 18.5, depending on the sample size and the CGM signal strength within the relevant mass bin. We detect the CGM signal down to $\rm M_{200}=10^{12.3}\,M_\odot$, and provide stringent upper limit at $\rm M_{200}<10^{12.3}\,M_\odot$. The data fit well with the standard GNFW profile of thermal pressure and do not require a flatter or steeper profile. This suggests a significant impact of cooling and the absence of dominant feedback. In galaxies with $\rm M_{200}\approx10^{12.3-12.8}\,M_\odot$ halos, the volume filling CGM is likely the largest contributor to the $galactic$ baryons at their virial temperatures of $\sim$10$^{6-6.4}\rm\,K$. For $\rm M_{200}>10^{12.8}\,M_\odot$ halos, the most massive phase of the CGM is likely at a sub-virial temperature of $\rm\gtrsim 10^6\,K$. The thermal energy of the CGM of quiescent galaxies follows the self-similar relation with mass, but the star-forming galaxies deviate from this relation. This indicates that the impact of non-gravitational factors varies among halos of different degrees of star-forming activity.
#### RAD@home citizen science discovery of two spiral galaxies where the 30-220 kpc radio lobes are possibly shaped by ram pressure stripping

 - **Abstract**
 We report the RAD@home citizen science discovery of two rare spiral-host radio galaxies (NGC 3898 and WISEA J221656.57-132042434.1 or RAD-"Thumbs up" galaxy), both exhibiting asymmetric radio lobes extending over 30 to 220 kiloparsec scales. We present a multi-wavelength image analysis of these two sources using radio, optical, and ultraviolet data. Both host galaxies are young, star-forming systems with asymmetric or distorted stellar disks. These disks show similarities to those in galaxies undergoing ram pressure stripping, and the radio morphologies resemble those of asymmetric or bent FR-II and wide-angle-tailed radio galaxies. We suggest that non-uniform gas density in the environment surrounding the ram pressure-stripped disks may contribute to the observed asymmetry in the size, shape, and brightness of the bipolar radio lobes. Such environmental effects, when properly accounted for, could help explain many of the non-standard radio morphologies observed in Seyfert galaxies and in recently identified populations of galaxies with galaxy-scale radio jets, now being revealed through deep and sensitive radio surveys with uGMRT, MeerKAT, LOFAR, and, in the future, the SKAO. These findings also underscore the potential of citizen science to complement professional research and data-driven approaches involving machine learning and artificial intelligence in the analysis of complex radio sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Predictions from current theories and simulations suggest that dual AGN systems are exceedingly rare at high redshifts. The intense radiation and powerful outflows from AGNs regulate star formation, heat the interstellar medium, and drive massive gas outflows that shape the host galaxy and its surroundings. One manifestation of AGN feedback is the creation of extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae. However, identifying these systems at high-$z$ is challenging. Here, we report a remarkable dual AGN candidate at $z \sim 5.4$ using JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec, with a separation of $\sim1.7$ arcseconds ($\sim10.4$ pkpc). This is one of the highest spectroscopically confirmed redshift dual AGNs discovered. Photometric SED fitting shows excellent agreement with AGN templates, strongly suggesting a rare dual AGN system. BPT diagrams and high ionisation lines further support the presence of AGNs. VLT/MUSE observations reveal strong extended Ly$\alpha$ emission, extending to $>22$ kpc, making it one of the most extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae at $z \sim 6$. This provides observational evidence of anisotropic AGN-driven photoionization or shocks. The high Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction also indicates an AGN outflow. This dual AGN candidate is also associated with a well-defined overdensity, potentially at the center of a $z \sim 5.4$ protocluster or filamentary structure node. Further analysis indicates the fraction of dual AGNs is significantly higher than theoretically expected at high redshifts. This discovery provides a new opportunity to study dual AGN interactions and their impact on the circumgalactic medium and cosmic structure evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The discrepancy between the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the observed lithium abundance in Spite plateau stars has been attributed either to a challenge to the standard model of nucleosynthesis or to stellar processes occurring after the stars formed. To understand the origin of this discrepancy, it is crucial to link the cosmic star formation rate with a chemical enrichment model that incorporates the yields of both Population (Pop) III and II stars. It is within this framework that the evolution of lithium can be determined. The primary goal is to demonstrate that there is no discrepancy between the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the observed lithium abundance. By combining a standard chemical evolution model with the hierarchical structure formation scenario, it is possible to determine the lithium abundance as a function of $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]$. The model's results are compared with observational data, including two extremely iron-poor stars: J0023+0307 and SMSS J0313-6708. The Spite plateau is naturally established in the range $-8.0 \lesssim [\mathrm{Fe/H}] \lesssim -2.0$ with $^{7}\mathrm{Li/H}$ $\sim 1.81 \times 10^{-10}$. We find that J0023+0307 could have formed $\sim 4.4 \times 10^{5} - 1.3 \times 10^{6}$ years after the explosion of the first Pop III star in the Universe, whereas for SMSS J0313-6708 this event would have occurred $\sim 2.2 \times 10^{5} - 4.4 \times 10^{5}$ years later. The Spite plateau serves as an observational signature of the formation of Pop III stars. The abundances observed in J0023+0307 and SMSS J0313-6708 are consistent with Pop III progenitor stars in the mass range $10-100 M_{\odot}$. However, if some high-redshift star formation occurs within subhalo-like structures, the contribution of stars in the mass range $140-260 M_{\odot}$ to the formation of the extended Spite plateau cannot be ruled out.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-channel aperiodic fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based hydroxyl (OH) line filters have attracted significant interest in ground-based near-infrared (NIR) astronomical observations. In this paper, we present the performance of a new self-compensating enclosure for the filters, that can be used in non-temperature-controlled environments. Our prototype encloses a 110 mm long single-mode photosensitive optical fiber with three 10 mm filter gratings. A fourth grating was used as a reference outside the package to measure the uncompensated wavelength shift. The prototype was tested over three thermal cycles, and showed a maximum wavelength deviation of 12 pm, a wavelength drift of only 0.37 pm/$^{\circ}$C, over the temperature range of -17$^{\circ}$C to 15$^{\circ}$C. The athermalization factor, i.e., the ratio of the maximum wavelength shift of the compensated grating to the uncompensated reference filter grating was $\frac{1}{22}$. The results demonstrate the capability of the prototype for stabilizing multi-channel long-length FBGs or chirped FBGs, particularly for astronomical applications that require sub-picometer stability.
#### Multi-TeV Gamma Rays from GRB 221009A: Challenges for Emission Mechanisms, EBL Opacity, and Fundamental Physics

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of gamma-ray burst GRB~221009A has attracted significant attention due to its record brightness and the first-ever detection of multi-TeV $\gamma$-rays from a GRB. Located at redshift $z=0.151$, this event is relatively nearby by GRB standards yet remains cosmologically distant, making the survival of multi-TeV photons surprising. The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory detected photons with energies up to $\sim 13$~TeV during the early afterglow phase, challenging standard EBL models. We investigate whether several theoretical frameworks can explain this anomalous emission: reduced EBL opacity due to cosmic voids along the line of sight, novel emission mechanisms within the GRB environment, secondary $\gamma$-ray production through cosmic-ray cascades, and new-physics scenarios involving Lorentz-invariance violation or axion-like particles. Our analysis highlights the exceptional nature of this event and ongoing theoretical tensions about the dominant physical processes. We discuss the limitations of current models and identify specific observational signatures that future multiwavelength and multi-messenger observations could provide to discriminate between competing explanations. Continued study of similar events with next-generation facilities will be crucial for resolving these challenges and advancing our understanding of extreme particle acceleration in astrophysical environments.
#### Tight correlation of star formation with [Ci] and CO lines across cosmic time

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Cold molecular gas tracers, such as CI and CO lines, have been widely used to infer specific characteristics of the ISM and to derive star-formation relations among galaxies. Aims. However, there is still a lack of systematic studies of the star-formation scaling relation of CO and [CI] lines across cosmic time on multiple physical scales. Methods. We used observations of the ground state transitions of [CI], CO, and [CII], for 885 sources collected from the literature, to infer possible correlations between line luminosities of $\rm L^{'}_{[CI](1-0)}, \rm L^{'}_{CO(1-0)}$, and $\rm L^{'}_{[CII]}$ with star formation rates (SFR). With linear regression, we fit the relations between SFR and molecular mass derived from CO, CI, and CII lines. Results. The relation between [CI] and CO-based total molecular masses is weakly superlinear. Nevertheless, they can be calibrated against each other. For $\rm \alpha_{CO} = 0.8$ and $4.0\ \rm {M}_{\odot}\,({K}\,{km}\,{s}^{-1}\,{pc}^2)^{-1}$ we derive $\alpha_{\rm [CI]} = 3.9$ and $\sim$$17\ \rm {M}_{\odot}\,({K}\,{km}\,{s}^{-1}\,{pc}^2)^{-1}$ , respectively. Using the \emph{lmfit} package, we derived relation slopes of SFR--$\rm L^{'}_{[CI](1-0)}$, SFR--$\rm L^{'}_{CO(1-0)}$, and SFR--$\rm L^{'}_{[CII](1-0)}$ to be $\rm \beta$ = 1.06 $\pm$ 0.02, 1.24 $\pm$ 0.02, and 0.74 $\pm$ 0.02, respectively. With a Bayesian-inference \emph{linmix} method, we find consistent results. Conclusions. Our relations for [CI](1-0) and CO(1-0) indicate that they trace similar molecular gas contents, across different redshifts and different types of galaxies. This suggests that these correlations do not have strong evolution with cosmic time.
#### GW231123: a Possible Primordial Black Hole Origin

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123, the heaviest binary black hole merger detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration to date, lies in the pair-instability mass gap and exhibits unusually high component spins. In this letter, we show that both merging black holes may have a primordial origin with smaller initial masses. The observed masses and, crucially, the spins of GW231123 are naturally accommodated within the most vanilla primordial black hole framework, once cosmological accretion is taken into account. Interestingly, the parameter space needed to explain the inferred GW231123 rate is at the edge of the exclusion region from Xray and CMB observations, suggesting that this interpretation can be either confirmed or ruled out. The upcoming O5 observing run by the collaboration should detect ${\cal O}(20)$ similar events, testing their mass-spin correlation, while next-generation detectors would be capable of observing high redshift events, as predicted in this scenario.
