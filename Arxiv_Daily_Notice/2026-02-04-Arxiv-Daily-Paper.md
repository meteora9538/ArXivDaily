#### Formation and Evolution of Antimatter Objects

 - **Abstract**
 The fundamental question of baryogenesis and the problem of matter-antimatter asymmetry motivate this study into the formation and evolution of antimatter objects in the early Universe. Hypothesize is the existence of isolated antimatter domains in a baryon-asymmetric Universe that survive until the era of first star formation ($Z \approx 20$). By assuming CPT-symmetry, the thermodynamics, mechanics, and energy dynamics of an antimatter gas cloud (composed of antihydrogen and antihelium) are treated symmetrically to their primordial matter counterparts. Analysis demonstrates the physical feasibility of the gravitational collapse process for a conservatively estimated antimatter domain ($\approx 5 \times 10^3 M_{\odot}$). The initial conditions easily satisfy the Jeans and Bonnor-Ebert mass criteria, indicating a high propensity for instability and runaway collapse. The subsequent dynamical evolution, driven by $\bar{H}_2$ cooling, is predicted to proceed identically to that of Population III star formation, leading to the formation of a dense, adiabatic anti-protostellar core. The theoretical viability of a true antistar hinges upon a critical assumption: the physical possibility of antinuclear fusion (e.g., the antiproton cycle) under extreme core conditions. Assuming this symmetry holds, the collapse is predicted to yield massive antistars ($\gtrsim 22 M_{\odot}$). This suggests that if antimatter domains formed in the early Universe, they likely underwent stellar formation. Observational constraints on the existence of these objects must rely on the detection of characteristic high-energy $\gamma$-ray or X-ray signals resulting from matter-antimatter annihilation at the domain boundaries or during mass accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the physical origin of the star formation scaling relations between the gas depletion time, the star-forming gas mass fraction, and the gas surface density, $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$, on kiloparsec scales, all of which are the key ingredients of the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. To elucidate these trends, we employ an analytical framework that explicitly connects these kiloparsec-scale properties to the timescales governing the rapid, continuous ISM gas cycle on the scales of individual star-forming regions, including the formation, dispersal, and local depletion of star-forming gas. Using a suite of idealized disk galaxy simulations spanning a range of environments from dwarf and Milky Way-mass systems to a gas-rich starburst analog, we measure the timescales of the gas cycle and relate them to the dynamical and turbulent properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). We find that star-forming regions form on a timescale close to the vertical turbulent crossing time of the galactic disk, $\sim$3-30 Myr, which decreases at higher $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ due to the increase in turbulent velocities in the ISM and the decrease in the disk thickness. In contrast, the local star formation and dispersal of such gas are set by the local conditions. Specifically, the local depletion time, $\sim$200-2000 Myr, is decreasing at higher $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$, as star-forming gas becomes denser and more efficient in forming stars. The lifetime of such gas is very short, $\sim$0.4-1 Myr, and only weakly increases with $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$. Together, our results demonstrate how the star formation properties of galaxies on kiloparsec scales emerge directly from the interplay between the galaxy-scale dynamics, ISM turbulence, and the state of star-forming gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular gas, modest in mass yet pivotal within the cosmic inventory, regulates baryon cycling as the immediate fuel for star formation. Across most of cosmic history, its reservoir has remained elusive, with only the tip of the iceberg revealed by luminous carbon monoxide (CO) emitting galaxies. Here we report the first detections of the mean cosmic CO background across its rotational ladder at 7$\sigma$, together with ionized carbon ([CII]) at 3$\sigma$, over $0<z<4.2$. This uses tomographic clustering of diffuse broadband intensities with reference galaxies, directly probing aggregate emission in the cosmic web. From CO(1-0) we infer the total molecular gas density, $\Omega_{\rm H_2}$, finding it about twice that resolved in galaxy surveys. The global depletion time is $\sim$1 Gyr, shorter than the Hubble time, requiring sustained inflow. CO excitation links to star-formation surface density and, with depletion time, yields a super-linear Kennicutt-Schmidt law that appears universal. Together these results establish a global picture of galaxy growth fueled by a larger, short-lived molecular reservoir. The CO and [CII] detections mark a turning point for line-intensity mapping, replacing forecasts with empirical line strengths and defining sensitivity requirements for upcoming 3D experiments poised to open new windows on galaxy formation and cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 We fit the multi-band light curves of 2,205 Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) from the Zwicky Transient Facility DR2 with a one-zone radioactive decay model with a phenomenological addition to include Fe recombination physics. We find a strong correlation between inferred nickel mass and SALT2 stretch, which within our simplified modelling is linked to larger ejecta masses providing longer diffusion times, providing a physical basis for the brighter-slower relation. SN~Ia in low-mass hosts ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_\odot) < 10$) produce $12\%$ more $^{56}$Ni than those in high-mass hosts ($\Delta M_{\rm Ni} = 0.13~M_\odot$), linking the host-galaxy mass step to ejecta properties and hinting at metallicity or age-dependent burning efficiencies. This suggests that standardisation based on physical parameters may remove the mass-step. SN~1991T-like events show higher ejecta masses (median $1.64~M_\odot$ vs. $1.38~M_\odot$ for normals) and produce $30\%$ more $^{56}$Ni, with $84\%$ having super-Chandrasekhar masses. Through Hierarchical modelling of $902$ SNe ($z \leq 0.06$), we find thermonuclear supernovae can be well described by a Gaussian distribution in ejecta mass and nickel mass with $\mu_{\rm ej} = 1.26 \pm 0.01~M_\odot$ ($\sigma_{\rm ej} = 0.33 \pm 0.01~M_\odot$) and $\mu_{\rm Ni} = 0.64 \pm 0.06~M_\odot$ ($\sigma_{\rm Ni} = 0.42 \pm 0.02~M_\odot$), respectively. This leads to inferred fractions of $43 \pm 2\%$ sub-$M_{\rm Ch}$ ($<1.2~M_\odot$), $34 \pm 1\%$ near-$M_{\rm Ch}$ ($1.2$--$1.5~M_\odot$), and $24 \pm 2\%$ super-$M_{\rm Ch}$ ($>1.5~M_\odot$) events. This work provides a step towards holistic physical characterization of the local SN~Ia population, reinforcing the physical basis of SN~Ia standardization while quantifying diversity and environmental dependencies critical for understanding progenitor physics and mitigating systematics in precision cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift quasars have been an excellent tracer to study the astrophysics and cosmology at early Universe. Using 216,949 high-redshift quasar candidates ($5.0 \leq z < 6.3$) selected via machine learning from the Legacy Survey Data Release 9 and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we perform wide-field clustering analysis to investigate the large-scale environment of those high-redshift quasars. We construct the projected auto correlation function of those high-redshift quasars that is weighted by its predicted probability of being a true high-redshift quasar, from which we derive the bias parameter and the typical dark matter halo mass of those quasars. The dark matter halo mass of quasars estimated from the projected auto correlation function is $\log(M_h/M_{\odot})=12.2 ^{+0.2}_{-0.7}$ ($11.9^{+0.3}_{-0.7}$), with the bias parameter $b$ of $12.34 ^{+4.26}_{-4.37}$ ($11.52^{+4.02}_{-4.14}$) for the redshift interval of $5.0 \leq z <5.7$ ($5.7 \leq z <6.3$). Our results, combined with other measurements of dark matter halo masses for quasars or active galactic nucleus which obtain a lower dark matter halo mass of $\sim 10^{11.5}$ M$_\odot$ at similar redshift, suggest a more complex, and possibly non-monotonic evolution of quasar hosting dark matter halo. Moreover, we estimate the duty cycle of those quasars, which is $0.008^{+0.135}_{-0.007}$ ($0.003+^{+0.047}_{-0.003}$) for the redshift interval of $5.0 \leq z <5.7$ ($5.7 \leq z <6.3$).

 - **Abstract**
 Complete catalogs of molecular clouds in the Milky Way allow analysis of the molecular medium and the star formation properties of the Milky Way that closely follows the method used for nearby galaxies. We explore whether the big dip in the radial distribution of molecular gas in the Milky Way is peculiar and find several other galaxies with similar patterns, all with similar morphological classifications of YClxxGnR, indicating a clearly defined, long bar leading to a grand-design spiral. This category is fairly rare among galaxies in the PHANGS sample, but all galaxies with this classification have some evidence for dips in the radial distribution of CO emission. The lengths of the bars correlate with the extents of the dips. The Milky Way and the other galaxies with dips have similar stellar masses and star formation rates, both lying near the high ends of the distributions for all PHANGS galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a cosmological zoom-in radiation magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation, using FORGE'd in FIRE, that follows the formation, growth, and evolution of a single metal-free Pop. III (proto)star at redshift $z \sim 14$. The simulation captures a rotationally supported circumstellar disk and protostellar jets, both resolved down to $<100$ au scales. We find the star grows to $\sim 27$ M$_{\odot}$ over $31,000$ years, with its final mass regulated by accretion and protostellar jets. Protostellar jets form because the magnetic mass-to-flux ratio lies within the regime that allows jet launching, and they are further enabled by a rotating circumstellar disk with sufficient gas-magnetic-field coupling, both present in this simulation. These jets regulate accretion onto the (proto)star and drive outflows that collide with infalling gas, slowing inflow at large radii due to the substantial momentum they carry. A circumstellar disk forms, extending out to $\sim 0.01$ pc, which remains gravitationally stable (Q $\gg 1$). The stability of the disk is maintained through both thermal support and turbulence. In this paper we focus on how jets play a critical role not only in shaping the final masses of Pop. III stars but also in directly influencing their surroundings by regulating accretion. These results will provide important insights into the initial mass function and feedback processes in the earliest star-forming regions of the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We report a revised spectroscopic redshift for the dusty massive galaxy S1, previously inferred with an exceptionally high baryon-to-star conversion efficiency from NIRCam slitless grism data at $z_{\rm grism}=5.58$. Our new JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations reveal multiple rest-frame optical and NIR emission lines, yielding a secure spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\rm spec}=3.2439\pm0.0002$. We show that the earlier grism-based redshift resulted from contamination by a nearby galaxy whose dispersed spectral trace overlaps with S1, illustrating a known challenge of slitless spectroscopy when only a single dispersion angle and single emission feature are available. In addition, we present new ALMA 1 mm observations, which robustly detect dust emission ($S_{\rm 1mm}=0.99\pm0.03$ mJy) and show a dust half-light radius ($R_{\rm e,1mm}=0.73\pm0.10$ kpc) slightly smaller than the stellar size ($R_{\rm e, F444W} = 0.97\pm0.01$ kpc). Using the revised redshift and compiled multi-wavelength photometry, we update the UV-to-FIR SED and find that S1 is less extreme than previously inferred, yet remains a very massive (log$M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\sim10.6$), heavily obscured star-forming galaxy. The updated SED modeling reveals S1 to be a very dust- and gas-rich system with a moderate star formation rate and a long gas depletion time ($\tau_{\rm dep} \sim 1.4$ Gyr), deviating from SMGs and OFGs, but more closely resembling typical massive main-sequence galaxies. We note that, although this revision reduces the number of ultra-massive galaxies reported in Xiao et al. 2024, it does not alter the main conclusions of that work. Overall, our study clarifies the nature of S1 and underscores the importance of multi-line spectroscopic confirmation, slitless observations at multiple position angles, and IFU data for robust redshift and physical characterization of rare massive galaxies in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Cluster environments influence galaxy evolution by curtailing star formation activity, notably through ram-pressure stripping (RPS). In this study, using spatially resolved spectroscopic data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey, we identify galaxies undergoing or recently affected by RPS in eight nearby clusters ($0.029 < z < 0.058$), through a visual classification scheme based on the ionised gas ($\rm H\alpha + [NII]\lambda 6584$) morphologies, split into unperturbed, asymmetric, and truncated. The projected phase-space analysis shows that asymmetric galaxies are found in a narrow region in cluster-centric distance ($\rm 0.1 < R/R_{200} < 0.6$) and have a larger dispersion in line-of-sight velocity ($\sigma(|v_{pec}|)_\mathrm{Asym} = 0.71^{+0.09}_{-0.07}\ \sigma_{200}$) compared to the truncated and unperturbed samples. In terms of star formation activity, RPS candidates yield a much steeper resolved star-forming main sequence (rSFMS; $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR} - \Sigma_\ast$) relation compared to the unperturbed counterparts, primarily emerging from having lower $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ values for the low mass density regime, with the steepest gradient deriving from the truncated sample. Moreover, radial star formation profiles reveal that star formation in RPS candidates is suppressed in the outskirts relative to unperturbed galaxies and is more prominent for the truncated sample. In contrast, central ($\rm r/r_{eff}<0.5$) star formation activity in RPS candidates is comparable with that in their unperturbed and field counterparts, suggesting no elevated activity. Taken together, this suggests an evolutionary trend linked to the RPS stage, where unperturbed galaxies likely represent recently accreted systems (pre-RPS), while asymmetric and truncated galaxies may correspond to populations undergoing RPS and post-RPS phases, respectively, favouring outside-in quenching.

 - **Abstract**
 The outer Galaxy (galactocentric distance $\gtrsim$13.5 kpc) serves as an excellent laboratory for investigating the chemical complexity in low-metallicity environments. Here, we present the chemical analyses for the outer Galactic hot core Sh 2-283-1a SMM1 ($D_\mathrm{GC}$ = 15.7 kpc and $Z$ $\sim$0.3 $Z_\odot$), recently detected by Ikeda et al. (2025) using ALMA. Toward this source, a variety of molecular species, including complex organic molecules (COMs: CH$_3$OH, $^{13}$CH$_3$OH, CH$_2$DOH, and CH$_3$OCH$_3$) are detected. The molecular abundances relative to CH$_3$OH are similar to those of another outer Galactic hot core, demonstrating that chemically rich hot cores exist in different regions of the outer Galaxy. We also compared molecular abundances among hot cores in the inner Galaxy, outer Galaxy, and Magellanic Clouds. This comparison revealed that the metallicity-corrected $N$(SO$_2$)/$N$(H$_2$) ratios of outer Galactic hot cores are significantly lower than those of the inner Galactic ones, while their $N$(CH$_3$OH)/$N$(H$_2$) ratios are similar. The Magellanic hot cores show different trends despite having metallicities similar to those of the outer Galaxy, indicating that the chemical complexity of hot cores is governed by environmental conditions (e.g., cosmic ray intensity and dust temperature) rather than simple metallicity scaling. These environmental differences would also affect the production efficiency of COMs derived from CH$_3$OH, as the $N$(CH$_3$OCH$_3$)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) and $N$(C$_2$H$_5$OH)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) ratios in the outer Galactic sources are moderately lower than those of inner Galactic sources. The $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) ratio of Sh 2-283-1a SMM1 is 1.5$^{+3.9}_{-1.2}$$\%$, comparable to that of inner Galactic high-mass sources.
#### Periodic 6.7 GHz $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$ maser emission in G353.273+0.641: First candidate for a pulsating high-mass protostar

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the periodic flux variations in the 6.7 GHz $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$ maser associated with the high-mass protostar G353.273+0.641, based on 13 yr of monitoring mainly by the Hitachi 32 m telescope. We identified a periodicity of 309 days based on a nearly complete light curve, with 833 epochs every few days. A strong correlation is found between the maser and the mid-infrared fluxes at 3.4 and 4.6 $\mu$m observed by NEOWISE during these periods, suggesting that the maser emission responds to variations in the protostellar luminosity. The average profile of the maser light curve is asymmetric and shows a steep drop in intensity just before the brightening, resembling that of some pulsating variable stars. Assuming a protostellar pulsation as the origin of maser periodicity, the observed period implies a cool and highly bloated, red supergiant-like structure. Such a bloated structure is consistent with a theoretical model of protostellar evolution under high accretion rates. The inferred protostellar parameters are broadly consistent with the theoretical model of pulsational instability during the early phase of high-mass star formation. However, a periodic accretion scenario caused by an unresolved compact protobinary cannot be completely ruled out. Several irregular peaks that deviate from the periodicity may result from episodic accretion phenomena or jet-launching events independent of the protostellar pulsation. Extremely high-resolution imaging with next-generation interferometers such as the ngVLA will provide a conclusive test for both the protostellar pulsation and the binary accretion scenarios.
#### Convolutional Neural Networks for classifying galaxy mergers: Can faint tidal features aid in classifying mergers?

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying mergers from observational data has been a crucial aspect of studying galaxy evolution and formation. Tidal features, typically fainter than 26 ${\rm mag\,arcsec^{-2}}$, exhibit a diverse range of appearances depending on the merger characteristics and are expected to be investigated in greater detail with the Rubin Observatory Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will reveal the low surface brightness universe with unprecedented precision. Our goal is to assess the feasibility of developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can distinguish between mergers and non-mergers based on LSST-like deep images. To this end, we used Illustris TNG50, one of the highest-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to date, allowing us to generate LSST-like mock images with a depth $\sim$ 29 ${\rm mag\,arcsec^{-2}}$ for low-redshift ($z=0.16$) galaxies, with labeling based on their merger status as ground truth. We focused on 151 Milky Way-like galaxies in field environments, comprising 81 non-mergers and 70 mergers. After applying data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning, a CNN model was developed with an accuracy of 65--67\%. Through additional image processing, the model was further optimized, achieving an accuracy of 67--70\% when trained on images containing only faint features. This represents an improvement of $\sim$ 5\% compared to training on images with bright features only. This suggests that faint tidal features can serve as effective indicators for distinguishing between mergers and non-mergers. The future direction for further improvement based on this study is also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamics of the inner regions of young stellar objects (YSOs) is driven by a variety of physical phenomena, from magnetospheres and accretion to the dust sublimation rim and inner disk flows. These inner environments evolve on timescales of hours to days, exactly when bursts, dips, and rapid structural changes carry the most valuable information about star and planet formations, but remain hardly reachable with current facilities. A better reactive infrastructure with six or more telescopes, combined with alerts from large time-domain surveys (e.g., at the era of LSST/Rubin type facilities), and equipped with instruments spanning from the V-band to the thermal infrared (N), would provide the instantaneous uv-coverage and spectral diagnostics needed to unambiguously interpret and image these events as they happen. Such a world's first time-domain interferometric observatory would enable qualitatively new science: directly linking optical and infrared variability to spatially resolved changes in magnetospheric accretion, inner-disk geometry, and dust and gas dynamics in the innermost astronomical unit. Crucially, connecting these processes to outer-scale unresolved information from JWST, ALMA, and the ELT would yield a complete tomography of the planet-forming region.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D MHD) simulations of the plasma flow structure in the vicinity of a compact cluster of young massive stars. The cluster is considered at the evolutionary stage dominated by Wolf-Rayet stars. This stage occurs in clusters with ages of several million years, close to the onset of supernova explosions; the well-known objects Westerlund 1 and 2 are the prototypes. The collisions of powerful winds from massive stars in the cluster core, calculated as interactions of individual outflows, are accompanied by their partial thermalization and produce a collective cluster wind. The MHD dynamics of the cluster wind bubble expansion into the interstellar medium is considered, depending on the density of the surrounding medium with a uniform magnetic field. We show that when expanding into a cold neutral medium, the cluster wind is able to reshape its surrounding environment over the Wolf-Rayet star lifetime, sweeping up more than $10^4$ $M_{\odot}$ of gas in $\sim 2 \times 10^5$ yr and producing extended, thin and dense shells with an amplified magnetic field. In a cold neutral medium with a density of $\sim 20$ cm$^{-3}$ and a magnetic field of $\sim 3.5$ $\mu$G, a thin shell forms around the cluster wind bubble, characterized by a cellular structure in its density and magnetic field distributions. The cellular magnetic field structure appears in parts of the shell expanding transversely to the orientation of the external magnetic field. Magnetic fields in the shell are amplified to strengths $\gtrsim 50$ $\mu$G. The formation of the cellular structure is associated with the development of instabilities. The expansion of the bubble into a warm neutral interstellar medium also leads to the formation of a shell with an amplified magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent theoretical and observational analysis of the interaction between the Milky Way (MW) and LMC suggest that it has a significant dynamical impact on the MW's stellar halo. We investigate this effect using simulations from the Latte project, a simulation suite from the Feedback In Realistic Environments 2 (FIRE-2) Project. By comparing simulations with and without an LMC-analog interaction, we show that fully cosmological LMC interactions create prominent velocity asymmetry in the stellar halo of the MW, resulting from both barycentric displacement (the "reflex motion") and the dynamical wake of the LMC. The strength and direction of this asymmetry depend on the mass ratio at pericenter and orbit of the LMC analog. We perform a spherical-harmonic decomposition of the velocities of halo star particles to confirm that the identified signatures are LMC-induced and persist even when LMC star particles are removed. We also show that this strategy separates and individually detects the dipole (l=1) of the global reflex motion and the quadrupole (l=2) of the local wake. These asymmetries are consistent with those identified in previous work using non-cosmological simulations; the dipole is easily distinguishable from other complex halo substructure using spherical harmonics while the quadrupole is sometimes confused. These findings support the detectability of MW--LMC interaction signatures in upcoming observational surveys of the MW stellar halo.

 - **Abstract**
 Narrow interstellar absorption features in supernova (SN) spectra serve as valuable diagnostics for probing dust extinction and the presence of circumstellar or interstellar material. In this third paper in a series, we investigate how the strength of narrow interstellar absorption lines in low-resolution spectra varies with SN type and host galaxy properties, both on local and global scales. Using a dataset of over 10000 spectra from $\sim1800$ low-redshift SNe, we find that Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) in passive galaxies exhibit significantly weaker narrow absorption features compared to CC-SNe and SNe Ia in star-forming hosts (SNe Ia-SF), suggesting lower interstellar gas content in quiescent environments. Within the star-forming hosts, the Na I D equivalent-width distribution of SNe II is much lower than that of both SNe Ia-SF and stripped-envelope SNe (SE-SNe). This result is somewhat unexpected, since CC-SNe are generally associated with star-forming regions and occur deeper within galactic disks, where stronger line-of-sight extinction would be anticipated. This suggests that the observed behaviour cannot be explained solely by absorption from the integrated interstellar medium (ISM) along the line of sight. Instead, if part of the absorption arises from material near the explosion, the similarity between the Na I D EW distributions of SNe Ia-SF and SE-SNe implies that comparable absorption signatures can emerge from distinct progenitor pathways. Possible explanations include (a) circumstellar material (CSM) expelled by the progenitor system before explosion, or (b) interaction of SN radiation with nearby patchy ISM clouds. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of interstellar absorption features in revealing the diverse environments and progenitor pathways of SNe.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterium fractionation is highly efficient during the early stages of star formation, particularly in starless and prestellar cores where temperatures are low (<10 K) and molecular freeze-out onto dust grains is significant. Methanol forms early in these environments following CO freeze-out via successive hydrogenation reactions on grain surfaces, while the production of deuterated methanol requires elevated gas-phase D/H ratios generated through dissociative recombination of deuterated H3+. Consequently, large abundances of deuterated methanol are observed toward young stellar objects where prestellar ices have recently sublimated. Here, we present laboratory infrared spectra of methanol and its deuterated isotopologues in astrophysical ice analogues, complemented by anharmonic vibrational calculations used to guide band assignments. Experiments were performed at the CASICE laboratory using a Bruker Vertex 70v spectrometer coupled to a closed-cycle helium cryostat, with isotopologue ices deposited at 10 K under high-vacuum conditions. Infrared transmission spectra were recorded over 6000-30 cm-1 (1.67-333 um) and compared with spectra of pure isotopologue ices. Distinctive mid-infrared band patterns are identified for each deuterated species. In particular, CH2DOH exhibits a characteristic doublet at 1293 and 1326 cm-1 (7.73 and 7.54 um), while CHD2OH shows a similar doublet at 1301 and 1329 cm-1 (7.69 and 7.52 um), both remaining largely invariant across all studied ice mixtures. These robust spectral signatures provide reliable tracers for identifying deuterated methanol in JWST observations and for constraining astrochemical gas-grain models of deuterium enrichment prior to star and planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical simulations are a key tool to decipher the dynamics of gravitation. Yet, they fail to spatially reproduce the Universe we observe, limiting comparison between observations and simulations to a statistical level. This is highly problematic for rare, faint or well studied nearby objects that are observed in a single environment. The computational cost of recovering this environment in random simulations is prohibitive. We present Hamlet-PM, a method that enables the constraining of initial conditions for cosmological simulations so as to produce evolved numerical universes that can be directly compared to observations of the Local Universe: constrained simulations. Our method implements the field-level forward modeling of the early-time density field from sparse and noisy measurements of late-time peculiar velocities. The dynamics are integrated with a particle-mesh gravity solver, thus probing the mildly non-linear regime. The code is applied to the Cosmicflows-4 compilation of peculiar velocities up to z < 0.05 (160 Mpc/h). The constrained ICs a re-simulated with a high precision N-body code. A series of one hundred dark-matter only cosmological constrained simulations with a resolution of 512^3 particles in a 500^3 [Mpc/h]3 box is presented. Special attention is given to twelve prominent nearby galaxy clusters, whose simulated counterparts are matched on criteria of mass and separation. We provide a mass estimate constrained by the dynamical environment for each cluster. Field-level forward modeling of the initial conditions produces highly constrained cosmological simulations. Currently, this method already overtakes in quality the pipeline in use in the peculiar-velocity community, although systematic biases still need to be addressed. Furthermore, improving the model is easy thanks to the inherent flexibility of the Bayesian approach.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal interactions play a crucial role in the orbital evolution of close-in star-planet systems. There are numerous manifestations of tides, including planetary orbital migration, breaking resonant chains, tidal heating, orbital circularization, spin-orbit alignment, and stellar and planetary spin synchronization. In the present study, we focus on the dissipation of internal gravity waves within stars. We examine two mechanisms: wave breaking in stars with radiative cores and magnetic wave conversion in stars with convective cores. Applying tidal prescriptions modelling these processes, we demonstrate that the enhanced stellar rotation of both TOI-2458 and GJ 504 can be explained by the previous engulfment of a hot Jupiter caused by gravity wave damping. Furthermore, we show that the observed population of hot Jupiters can be divided into two distinct subsamples: those that are too young for gravity wave dissipation and those where it is ongoing. These subsamples exhibit qualitatively different orbital period distributions: young systems have a uniform distribution, while older systems show a steep decline at short orbital periods. Using a population synthesis approach, we successfully reproduce the main features of the older hot Jupiter sample based on the distribution of the younger systems. According to our estimates, up to 20% of the main-sequence stars within the mass range [0.7,1.5] $M_{\odot}$ that once hosted a hot Jupiter may have since engulfed it. Our results highlight the key role of internal gravity wave dissipation in shaping the orbital architectures of hot Jupiter systems.
#### Star Grazing with Alumina Grass: Antireflection coatings in the visible and near-infrared on IPX-Clear Microlenses assisted by Grass-like Alumina

 - **Abstract**
 Two-photon polymerization (2PP) enables fabrication of high-precision micro-optics with complex freeform geometries, opening a new parameter space for custom astronomical optics. Among available resins, the newly developed IPX Clear is particularly well suited for visible applications, offering high transmission across the visible-near-IR, low surface roughness, and excellent shape fidelity. However, Fresnel reflections at the air-polymer interface introduce significant optical losses, which are detrimental in low-signal astronomy. Previous studies show grass-like alumina coatings on glass and fused silica can raise average transmission from 91.9% to approximately 99% over 400-900 nm. Here we explore the feasibility of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) to apply such coatings to IPX-Clear micro-optics over 400-1700 nm. Grass-like alumina anti-reflective (AR) coatings can approximate the ideal index condition by creating a gradual refractive-index transition from air to bulk IPX Clear, suppressing surface reflections. While grass-like coatings are established on bulk optics and conformal ALD films have been applied to 2PP micro-optics, we demonstrate - for the first time - alumina grass on 2PP microlenses made with the new IPX-Clear resin. We discuss key challenges and process steps, and observe that alumina-grass-coated microlenses lose only approximately 0.3% of photons to reflection in the 400-850 nm range. Future work will test performance across the full 400-1700 nm band and explore improved environmental resilience, e.g., a SiO2 overcoat. Combined with the high optical transparency of IPX Clear, these coatings enable custom-designed, highly efficient microlenses for astronomical applications.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) are thought to be a driving mechanism of large-scale winds driven by active galactic nuclei, which cause significant galactic feedback through quenching star formation and regulating supermassive black hole growth. We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium-Resolution Spectrometer observations of two nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), F11119+3257 and F05189-2524, with nuclear X-ray detected UFOs and kiloparsec-scale outflow. These galaxies show remarkably similar mid-infrared continuum and emission line features, notably including a high-velocity $v_{90}$ $\sim$ 4000 km s$^{-1}$ outflow detected in highly ionized neon emission lines, e.g., \nevi. In F05189-2524, we see a slightly slower biconical outflow extending up to $\sim2$ kpc in the same neon emission lines. Both sources show evidence of AGN-driven radiative feedback through a deficit of rotational molecular hydrogen lines in the nuclear region, $<$1 kpc from the central quasar, but no clear evidence of any molecular gas entrained in the quasar-driven outflow. Energetic analysis shows that the warm ionized gas in both of these sources contributes minimally ($\sim0.1-5\%$) to the momentum outflow rate of these sources and leaves the conclusions of previous literature unchanged: the energetics of these sources are broadly consistent with a momentum-conserving outflow.
