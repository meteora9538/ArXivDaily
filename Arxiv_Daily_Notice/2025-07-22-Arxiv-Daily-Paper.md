 - **Abstract**
 Carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are significant contributors of carbonaceous dust to the galactic environment, however the mechanisms and conditions for formation and subsequent evolution of dust around these stars remain open questions. Here we present JWST observations of the WR+WR colliding-wind binary Apep which reveal an intricate series of nested concentric dust shells that are abundant in detailed substructure. The striking regularity in these substructures between successive shells suggests an exactly repeating formation mechanism combined with a highly stable outflow that maintains a consistent morphology even after reaching 0.6 pc (assuming a distance of 2.4 kpc) into the interstellar medium. The concentric dust shells show subtle deviations from spherical outflow, which could reflect orbital modulation along the eccentric binary orbit or some mild degree of non-sphericity in the stellar wind. Tracking the evolution of dust across the multi-tiered structure, we measure the dust temperature evolution that can broadly be described with an amorphous carbon composition in radiative thermal equilibrium with the central stars. The temperature profile and orbital period place new distance constraints that support Apep being at a greater distance than previously estimated, reducing the line-of-sight and sky-plane wind speed discrepancy previously thought to characterise the system.

 - **Abstract**
 ALMA-IMF is a large program of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) that aims to determine the origin of the core mass function (CMF) of 15 massive Galactic protoclusters (~ 1.0-25.0 x 10^3 solar mass within ~ 2.5 x 2.5 pc^2 ) located towards the Galactic plane. In addition, the objective of the program is to obtain a thorough understanding of their physical and kinematic properties. Here we study the turbulence in these protoclusters with C18O (2-1) emission line using the sonic Mach number analysis (M_s ) and the size-linewidth relation. The probability distribution functions (PDFs) for M_s show a similar pattern, exhibiting no clear trend associated with evolutionary stage, peaking in the range between 4 and 7, and then extending to ~ 25. Such values of M_s indicate that the turbulence in the density regime traced by the C18O line inside the protoclusters is supersonic in nature. In addition, we compare the non-thermal velocity dispersions (sigma_nth, C18O) obtained from the C18O(2-1) line with the non-thermal line widths (sigma_nth, DCN ) of the cores obtained from the DCN (3-2) line. We observe that, on average, the non-thermal linewidth in cores is half that of the gas surrounding them. This suggests that turbulence diminishes at smaller scales or dissipates at the periphery of the cores. Furthermore, we examine the size-linewidth relation for the structures we extracted from the position-position-velocity C18O(2-1) line emission cube with dendrogram algorithm. The power-law index (p) obtained from the size-linewidth relation is between 0.41 and 0.64, steeper than the Kolmogorov law of turbulence, as expected for compressible media. In conclusion, this work is one of the first to carry out such a statistical study of turbulence for embedded massive protoclusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Human activities degrade the Earth environment at an unprecedented scale and pace, threatening Earth-system stability, resilience and life-support functions. We can of course deny the facts, get angry about them, try to bargain, or fall into deep depression. Or we may overcome these stages of grief and move towards accepting that human activities need to change, including our own ones. The purpose of this paper is to support astronomers in this transition, by providing insights into the origins of environmental impacts in astronomical research and proposing changes that would make the field sustainable. The paper focuses on the environmental impacts of research infrastructures, since these are the dominant sources of greenhouse gas emissions in astronomy, acknowledging that impact reductions in other areas, for example professional air travelling, need also to be achieved.

 - **Abstract**
 Outflows are key indicators of ongoing star formation. We report the discovery of an unanchored forked stream within the propagating path of an extremely young protostellar outflow in the 70 $\mu$m-dark clump G34.74-0.12, based on ALMA 1.3 mm observations with an angular resolution of 1''.6 (~ 5000 au). This outflow originate from a 9.7 $M_{\odot}$ core, exhibits a fork-shaped stream structure in its red-shifted lobe, which is traced by CO (2-1), SiO (5-4), and H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$-2$_{0,2}$). It has a momentum of 13 $M_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$, an energy of 107 $M_{\odot}$ km$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$, and a dynamical timescale of ~10$^{4}$ yr. Significantly, the enhanced relative abundances of SiO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH with respect to CO, along with the increased temperature at the forked point, indicate a collisional origin. The forked point does not coincide with any dust continuum core > 0.1 $M_{\odot}$. Moreover, CO (2-1) emission also traces three other outflows in this region, characterized by their masses (0.40, 0.02 and 0.15 $M_{\odot}$) and momenta (5.2, 0.2, 1.8 $M_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$), as part of the ALMA Survey of 70 $\mu$m dark High-mass clumps in Early Stages (ASHES) project. All the newly discovered morphological and kinematic features associated with these extremely young protostellar outflows (with timescales of 10$^3$ - 10$^4$ years) suggest that the initial stages of star formation are more complicated than previously understood.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Molecular hydrogen and its cation H+2 are among the first species formed in the early Universe, and play a key role in the thermal and chemical evolution of the primordial gas. In molecular clouds, H+2 ions formed through ionization of H2 by particles react rapidly with H2 to form H+3 , triggering the formation of almost all detected interstellar molecules. Aims. We present a new set of cross sections and rate coefficients for state-to-state ro-vibrational transitions of the H+2 and HD+ ions, induced by low-energy electron collisions. Study includes the major electron-impact processes relevant for low-metallicity astrochemistry: inelastic and superelastic scattering, and dissociative recombination. Methods. The electron-induced processes involving H+2 and HD+ are treated using the multichannel quantum defect theory. Results. The newly calculated thermal rate coefficients show significant differences compared to those used in previous studies. When introduced into astrochemical models, particularly for shock-induced chemistry in metal-free gas, the updated dissociative recombination rates produce substantial changes in the predicted molecular abundances. Conclusions. These data provide updated and improved input for the modeling of hydrogen-rich plasmas in environments

 - **Abstract**
 Much of the carbonaceous dust observed in the early universe may originate from colliding wind binaries (CWBs) hosting hot, luminous Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Downstream of the shock between the stellar winds there exists a suitable environment for dust grain formation, and the orbital motion of the stars wraps this dust into richly structured spiral geometries. The Apep system is the most extreme WR-CWB in our Milky Way: two WR stars produce a complex spiral dust nebula, whose slow expansion has been linked to a gamma-ray burst progenitor. It has been unclear whether the O-type supergiant 0.7" distant from the WR+WR binary is physically associated with the system, and whether it affects the dusty nebula. Multi-epoch VLT/VISIR and JWST/MIRI observations show that this northern companion star routinely carves a cavity in the dust nebula - the first time such an effect has been observed in a CWB - which unambiguously associates the O star as a bound component to the Apep system. These observations are used together with a new geometric model to infer the cavity geometry and the orbit of the WR+WR binary, yielding the first strong constraints on wind and orbital parameters. We confirm an orbital period of over 190 years for the inner binary - nearly an order of magnitude longer than the next longest period dust-producing WR-CWB. This, together with the confirmed classification as a hierarchical triple, cements Apep as a singular astrophysical laboratory for studying colliding winds and the terminal life stages of the most massive star systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf galaxies dominate the galaxy population across all redshifts, and majority of mergers are expected to occur between them. However, the impact of dwarf-dwarf mergers on star formation (SF) is less understood. In this context, we study SF in 6,155 isolated dwarf galaxies (no massive galaxy, $M_{*} > 10^{10} M_{\odot}$, within 1 Mpc$^3$), including 194 post-mergers and 5,961 non-interacting galaxies, spanning stellar masses of $10^7$ - $10^{9.6}$ M$_{\odot}$ and redshifts of 0.01 - 0.12. Post-mergers sample is from a previous study, which used deep optical images to identify dwarf galaxies with merger signatures. Using GALEX FUV data, we estimate star formation rates (SFRs) and find difference in log(SFR) between a post-merger galaxy and the median of its corresponding control sample, matched in stellar mass and redshift. SFR offsets range from -2 to +2 dex, indicating both enhancement and suppression of SF in our sample with 67% of post-mergers showing enhancement. The median SFR is found to be elevated by 0.24 dex ($\sim$1.73 times) in post-mergers, comparable to enhancements seen in massive galaxies. SF is found to be similarly enhanced in both the central (6" diameter region) and outer regions of post-mergers with respect to their non-interacting counterparts. This is in contrast to what is observed in massive galaxies, where the merger-triggered SF is more significant in the central regions. In the given small range of redshift, post-merger dwarfs exhibit a higher median specific SFR compared to their non-interacting counterparts. About 33% of post-mergers are quenched, possibly reflecting a later stage of the post-merger regime, where quenching can happen as observed in massive galaxies. This study suggests that dwarf-dwarf mergers can affect SF in the local universe. A more comprehensive study of post-merger dwarfs is required to understand their evolution.
#### Searching for periodic signals and quasi-periodic oscillations from an extremely active cycle of FRB 20240114A

 - **Abstract**
 Possible periodic features in fast radio bursts (FRBs) may provide insights into their astrophysical origins. Using extensive observations from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we conduct a search for periodicity across multiple timescales in the exceptionally active repeater source FRB 20240114A. A detailed analysis of 11,553 bursts reveals three candidate periodic signals (3.4-6$\sigma$), with frequencies of approximately 1.486 Hz, 1.576 Hz, and 1.865 Hz. This finding offers tentative evidence for a potential association with magnetar spin, although further studies are necessary for definitive confirmation. On longer timescales, a 67.5-69.2 day activity cycle is identified using two independent methods, with a significance exceeding $3.5\sigma$. In the burst time series, quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the range of a few hundred Hz are identified, with a significance exceeding 5$\sigma$, and a strong correlation is found between their central frequencies and widths (Pearson $R=0.97$). The decomposed temporal profiles of these QPOs suggest an amplitude-modulated quasi-periodic signal. The burst clusters manifest periodic burst trains ranging from a few milliseconds to several tens of milliseconds, revealing transient periodic characteristics. Despite the unprecedentedly large sample size from a single repeating FRB source during a time-continuous active period, no stable periodic signals are detected. Instead, there are multiple QPOs that dynamically evolve over time. These results clarify the bias of previous studies that occasionally detected QPOs believed to be potentially related to the spin of compact objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Searching for signs of life is a primary goal of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). However, merely detecting oxygen, methane, or other widely discussed biosignatures is insufficient evidence for a biosphere. In parallel with biosignature detection, exoplanet life detection additionally requires characterization of the broader physicochemical context to evaluate planetary habitability and the plausibility that life could produce a particular biosignature in a given environment. Life detection further requires that we can confidently rule out photochemical or geological phenomena that can mimic life (i.e. "false positives"). Evaluating false positive scenarios may require different observatory specifications than biosignature detection surveys. Here, we explore the coronagraph requirements for assessing habitability and ruling out known false positive (and false negative) scenarios for oxygen and methane, the two most widely discussed biosignatures for Earth-like exoplanets. We find that broad wavelength coverage ranging from the near UV (0.26 $\mu$m) and extending into the near infrared (1.7 $\mu$m), is necessary for contextualizing biosignatures with HWO. The short wavelength cutoff is driven by the need to identify Proterozoic-like biospheres via O$_3$, whereas the long wavelength cutoff is driven by the need to contextualize O$_2$ and CH$_4$ biosignatures via constraints on C-bearing atmospheric species. The ability to obtain spectra with signal-to-noise ratios of 20-40 across this 0.26-1.7 $\mu$m range (assuming R=7 UV, R=140 VIS, and R=70 NIR) is also required. Without sufficiently broad wavelength coverage, we risk being unprepared to interpret biosignature detections and may ultimately be ill-equipped to confirm the detection of an Earth-like biosphere, which is a driving motivation of HWO..

 - **Abstract**
 Planets orbiting young, solar-type stars are embedded in a more energetic environment than that of the solar neighbourhood. They experience harsher conditions due to enhanced stellar magnetic activity and wind shaping the secular evolution of a planetary atmosphere. This study is dedicated to the characterisation of the magnetic activity of eleven Sun-like stars, with ages between 0.2 and 6.1 Gyr and rotation periods between 4.6 and 28.7 d. Based on a sub-sample of six stars, we aim to study the large-scale magnetic field, which we then use to simulate the associated stellar wind and environment. Finally, we want to determine the conditions during the early evolution of planetary habitability. We analysed high-resolution spectropolarimetric data collected in 2018 and 2019 with Narval. We computed activity diagnostics from chromospheric lines such as CaII H&K, H$\alpha$, and the CaII infrared triplet, as well as the longitudinal magnetic field from circularly polarised least-squares deconvolution profiles. For six stars exhibiting detectable circular polarisation signals, we reconstructed the large-scale magnetic field at the photospheric level by means of Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI). In agreement with previous studies, we found a global decrease in the activity indices and longitudinal field with increasing age and rotation period. The large-scale magnetic field of the six sub-sample stars displays a strength between 1 and 25 G and reveals substantial contributions from different components such as poloidal (40-90 %), toroidal (10-60 %), dipolar (30-80 %), and quadrupolar (10-40 %), with distinct levels of axisymmetry (6-84 %) and short-term variability of the order of months. Ultimately, this implies that exoplanets tend to experience a broad variety of stellar magnetic environments after their formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent 3D dust maps of the local Milky Way are revolutionizing our understanding of the Sun's Galactic neighborhood, bringing much-needed insight into the large-scale organization of the interstellar medium. Focusing on the largest scales in $\textit{Gaia}$-based 3D dust maps, we find a pattern of seven highly elongated, mostly parallel structures in the local $5\,\mathrm{kpc}^2$, five of which were previously unknown. These structures show pitch angles of $33.5 \pm 4.0 ^\circ$, and masses ranging from $10^5$ to $10^6$ $M_\odot$. We refer to these structures as superclouds. Nearly all known star-forming regions in the solar neighborhood lie within the superclouds, primarily along their central axes, supporting the idea that they are precursors to giant molecular clouds. All but one of the seven superclouds show an underlying undulation, indicating that this is not a property unique to the Radcliffe wave. We find that while the superclouds have line masses that vary by about a factor of four, their volume densities vary by about 10$\%$ only. This suggests that superclouds self-regulate their physical sizes and internal structure to maintain pressure equilibrium with their environment. These findings establish a new framework for understanding how large-scale Galactic structures shape the conditions for star formation in the solar vicinity, and likely in galaxies like the Milky Way.
#### A deep Search for Ethylene Glycol and Glycolonitrile in the V883 Ori Protoplanetary Disk

 - **Abstract**
 Ethylene glycol ($\mathrm{(CH_2OH)_2}$, hereafter EG) and Glycolonitrile ($\mathrm{HOCH_2CN}$, hereafter GN) are considered molecular precursors of nucleic acids. EG is a sugar alcohol and the reduced form of Glycolaldehyde ($\mathrm{CH_2(OH)CHO}$, hereafter GA). GN is considered a key precursor of adenine formation (nucleotide) and can be a precursor of glycine (amino acid). Detections of such prebiotic molecules in the interstellar medium are increasingly common. How much of this complexity endures to the planet formation stage, and thus is already present when planets form, remains largely unknown. Here we report Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations in which we tentatively detect EG and GN in the protoplanetary disk around the outbursting protostar V883 Ori. The observed EG emission is best reproduced by a column density of $\mathrm{3.63^{+0.11}_{-0.12} \times 10^{16} \; cm^{-2}}$ and a temperature of at least 300 K. The observed GN emission is best reproduced by a column density of $\mathrm{3.37^{+0.09}_{-0.09} \times 10^{16} \; cm^{-2}}$ and a temperature of $88^{+1.2}_{-1.2}$ K. Comparing the abundance of EG and GN relative to methanol in V883 Ori with other objects, V883 Ori falls between hot cores and comets in terms of increasing complexity. This suggests that the build up of prebiotic molecules continues past the hot core phase into the epoch of planet formation. Nascent planets in such environments may inherit essential building blocks for life, enhancing their potential habitability. Further observations of this protoplanetary disk at higher spectral resolution are required to resolve blended lines and to confirm these tentative detection.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite growing efforts to find the sources of high energy neutrinos measured by IceCube, the bulk of the neutrinos remain with unknown origins. We aim to constrain the emissivity of cosmic high-energy neutrinos from extragalactic sources through their correlation with the large-scale structure. We use cross-correlations between the IceCube 10-year dataset and tomographic maps of the galaxy overdensity to place constraints on the bias-weighted high-energy neutrino emissivity out to redshift $z\sim3$. We test two different models to describe the evolution of neutrino emissivity with redshift, a power law model $\propto (1+z)^a$, and a model tracking the star formation history, assuming a simple power law model for the energy injection spectrum. We also consider a non-parametric reconstruction of the astrophysical neutrino emissivity as a function of redshift. We do not find any significant correlation, with our strongest results corresponding to a $1.9 \sigma$ deviation with respect to a model with zero signal. We use our measurements to place upper bounds on the bias-weighted astrophysical high-energy neutrino emission rate as a function of redshift for different source models. This analysis provides a new probe to test extragalactic neutrino source models. With future neutrino and galaxy datasets we expect the constraining and detection power of this type of analysis analysis to increase.

 - **Abstract**
 A majority of JWST/NIRSpec/IFU studies at high redshifts to date have focused on UV-bright or massive objects, while our understanding of low-mass galaxies at early cosmic times remains limited. In this work, we present NIRSpec/IFS high-resolution observations of two low-mass ($M_* < 10^9 \ M_\odot$), low-metallicity ($[12 + \log(\text{O/H})] < 8$) galaxies at $z \sim 7.66$ with evidence of hosting AGN. Using spatially-resolved maps of rest-frame optical emission lines, we find flat metallicity profiles, indicative of ISM redistribution by outflows or past merging. We identify kinematical components decoupled from galactic rotation with velocities of $\sim 250 - 500 \ \text{km} \ \text{s}^{-1}$. We argue that these components are likely tracing outflows, possibly AGN-driven, for which we infer outflow rates of $\sim 21 - 40 \ M_\odot \ \text{yr}^{-1}$, suggesting they may suppress future star formation. We compare our observational results to those from the new large-volume AESOPICA simulations, which fully incorporate different models of black hole growth and AGN feedback. We find that our observational results of $v_\text{out}/v_\text{esc}$ and $\dot{M}_\text{out}$/SFR are consistent with the AGN population in these simulations, hinting that AGN-driven feedback may contribute to quenching both in our systems and in a wider population of low-mass galaxies in the early Universe. This novel study demonstrates the necessity of deep IFU observations to decompose the complex kinematics and morphology of high-$z$ galaxies, trace outflows, and constrain the effect of feedback in these low-mass systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the Type I migration of planets in low-density cavities and inner discs of strongly magnetized young stars using global three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, where the strong magnetic field carves the low-density cavity. Simulations show that a planet in the cavity migrates inwards up to the radius at which the outer Lindblad resonances are inside the cavity. At smaller radii, the migration stalls. The migration is faster if a star accretes in the unstable regime where the temporary tongues penetrate the magnetosphere. If a planet is in a highly inclined orbit, it interacts with the disc, and the eccentricity increases due to the Kozai-Lydov mechanism. A planet may stop or reverse its migration in the inner disc before entering the cavity. The magnetosphere interacts with the inner disc, changing its density distribution such that migration slows down or is even reversed. A tilted magnetosphere also excites density and bending waves in the disc, which may slow down migration and also increase the inclination and eccentricity of the planet. When a planet reaches the disc-cavity boundary, it is typically trapped at the boundary by asymmetric corotation torque. A planet moves together with the boundary when the cavity expands. Overall, a magnetized star provides an environment for slow or reverse migration.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present a study on the H$\alpha$ emission line flux concentration of 3098 low-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using the MaNGA data available in the Data Release 17 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We define the H$\alpha$ flux concentration index ($C_{\rm H\alpha}$) as $C_{\rm H\alpha}=F_{\rm H\alpha,0.8~R_e}/F_{\rm H\alpha,1.5~R_e}$, where $F_{\rm H\alpha,0.8~R_e}$ and $F_{\rm H\alpha,1.5~R_e}$ are the cumulative H$\alpha$ flux inside $0.8$ and $1.5$ $r-$band effective radius, respectively. We find that $C_{\rm H\alpha}$ is strongly correlated with the luminosity weighted stellar age gradient. $C_{\rm H\alpha}$ is also sensitive to environmental effects, in the sense that low-mass satellite galaxies below the star formation main sequence tend to have higher $C_{\rm H\alpha}$. For central galaxies, we find that massive disk galaxies with enhanced star formation rate tend to have higher $C_{\rm H\alpha}$, while such a phenomenon is not seen in the low-mass regime. We interpret this as evidence that compaction events more frequently occur in the high-mass regime, which eventually resulting in the buildup of prominent bulges in massive SFGs. Implications of these findings on galaxy structure formation are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Long-period radio transients (LPTs) represent a recently uncovered class of Galactic radio sources exhibiting minute-to-hour periodicities and highly polarised pulses of second-to-minute duration. Their phenomenology does not fit exactly in any other class, although it might resemble that of radio magnetars or of white dwarf (WD) radio emitting binary systems. Notably, two LPTs with confirmed multi-wavelength counterparts have been identified as synchronised white dwarf-M dwarf binaries (polars). Meanwhile, systems such as AR Scorpii and J1912-44 exhibit short-period pulsations in a hr-tight orbit, with polarized radio emission proposed to be generated by the interaction of the WD magnetosphere with the low-mass companion wind. Here we demonstrate that both LPTs and WD binary pulsars can be explained within a single geometric model in which radio emission is triggered when the magnetic pole of a rotating white dwarf intersects its companion's wind in the binary orbital plane. We use a 36-year timing baseline to infer the orbital period and binary geometry solely from radio data of GPM J1839-10, the longest-active LPT known. The model naturally predicts its intermittent emission and double-pulse structure. Crucially, we show that the beat period between the spin and the orbit matches the observed pulse substructure and polarisation signatures, providing strong support for the model. Applying this model to the WD binary pulsar J1912-44, it can also reproduce the system emission and geometry. Our results place GPM J1839-10, and other LPTs in general and radio emitting WD binaries, at different stages of a continuum between intermediate and synchronised polars, suggesting a unified population of magnetic WD binaries driving coherent radio emission.

 - **Abstract**
 To understand the chemical origin of the Solar system, the chemical evolution along the star/planet formation is a key issue. Extensive observational studies have demonstrated a chemical diversity in young low-mass protostellar sources so far. Furthermore, chemical differentiations in the vicinity of the protostars have recently been reported. This suggests that molecular distribution is sensitive to a change in the physical conditions associated with disk formation. Some kinds of molecular lines, especially Sulfur-bearing species, are therefore prospected to work as molecular markers to highlight particular structures of disk-forming regions. Conversely, detailed physical characterization is essential for elucidating the chemical evolution occurring there. Machine learnings may help us to disentangle the observed structures. Angular momentum of the gas is the key topic to understand the structure formation, which is also essential to the integration of the chemical and physical characterization.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently discovered supermassive black holes with masses of $\sim10^8\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\sim9$-$11$ in active galactic nuclei (AGN) pose severe challenges to our understanding of supermassive black hole formation. One proposed channel are rapidly accreting supermassive PopIII stars (SMSs) that form in large primordial gas halos and grow up to $<10^6\,M_\odot$. They eventually collapse due to the general relativistic instability and could lead to supernova-like explosions. This releases massive and energetic ejecta that then interact with the halo medium via an optically thick shock. We develop a semi-analytic model to compute the shock properties, bolometric luminosity, emission spectrum and photometry over time. The initial data is informed by stellar evolution and general relativistic SMS collapse simulations. We find that SMS explosion light curves reach a brightness $\sim10^{45\mathrm{-}47}\,\mathrm{erg/s}$ and last $10$-$200$ years in the source frame - up to $250$-$3000$ years with cosmic time dilation. This makes them quasi-persistent sources which vary indistinguishably to little red dots and AGN within $0.5$-$9\,(1+z)$ yrs. Bright SMS explosions are observable in long-wavelength JWST filters up to $z\leq20$ ($24$-$26$ mag) and pulsating SMSs up to $z\leq15$. EUCLID and the Roman space telescope (RST) can detect SMS explosions at $z<11$-$12$. Their deep fields could constrain the SMS rate down to $10^{-11}$Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, which is much deeper than JWST bounds. Based on cosmological simulations and observed star formation rates, we expect to image up to several hundred SMS explosions with EUCLID and dozens with RST deep fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Environmental effects within cosmological overdensities, such as galaxy groups and clusters, have been shown to impact galaxies and their cold gas reservoirs and thereby provide constraints on galaxy evolution models. Galaxy groups foster frequent galaxy-galaxy interactions, making them rich environments in which to study galaxy transformation. In this work, we study a serendipitously discovered large overdensity of HI galaxies at z~0.04. The galaxies appear to lie in a filamentary-like structure of megaparsec scale. MeerKAT's angular resolution and field of view allow us to spatially resolve the HI galaxies while simultaneously probing large-scale structure. The HI and sub-arcsec Dark Energy Survey (DES) imaging reveal a large number of interacting galaxies in this collective group. MeerKAT data enables us to derive HI masses and investigate interacting galaxies. We use DES and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data to quantify the star formation rates, stellar masses, and stellar morphologies of member galaxies and compare these with field scaling relations. To place this discovery and the environmental effects in context, we use the SIMBA simulation to investigate the prevalence of qualitatively similar HI overdensities and their large-scale morphological properties. This enables a prediction of how frequently such structures might be serendipitously discovered with MeerKAT and SKA-Mid HI observations in comparable observation time. The combination of spatially resolved HI data and optical imaging reveals a group rich in interactions, suggesting environmental processes are already shaping galaxy properties within the structure. More of these serendipitous discoveries are expected and, alongside ongoing targeted programmes, these will provide a rich sample to study galaxy transformation and enable a MeerKAT HI perspective on large-scale structure, including filaments.
#### Simulating Partial Sky Cosmic Microwave Background Maps with 3D Fast Fourier Transforms

 - **Abstract**
 Simulated maps of the microwave background (CMB) radiation are generally created using one of two methods: all-sky simulations use the spherical harmonic transform, while maps covering small areas approximate the sky as flat, allowing the use of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). Current and near-future experiments, particularly ones like CMB S4, will cover areas too large for the flat-sky approximation but significantly less than the full sky. In this regime, it can be more efficient to simulate maps in a 3-D box using FFTs, and then sample onto the observed part of the celestial sphere. We present a method for performing such simulations and show that it can be more efficient than full-sky simulations. We develop the method for scalar maps, but we expect it to be applicable to higher-spin (e.g., polarization) simulations as well.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs), the brightest cosmic radio explosions, is still unknown. Bearing critical clues to FRBs' origin, the long-term evolution of FRBs has yet to be confirmed, since the field is still young and most FRBs were seen only once. Here we report clear evidence of decadal evolution of FRB~20121102A, the first precisely localized repeater. In conjunction with archival data, our FAST and GBT monitoring campaign since 2020 reveals a significant 7% decline of local dispersion measure (DM). The rotation measure (RM) of 30,755$\pm$16 $\mathrm{rad\,m^{-2}}$ detected in the last epoch represents a 70% decrease compared to that from December 2016. The $\sigma_{RM}$ parameter, which describes the complexity of the magneto-ionic environment surrounding the source, was shown to have decreased by 13%. These general trends reveal an evolving FRB environment, which could originate from an early-phase supernova associated with an enhanced pair wind from the FRB central engine.
