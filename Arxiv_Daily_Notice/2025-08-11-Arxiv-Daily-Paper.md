 - **Abstract**
 We introduce CLAPP (CLASS LLM Agent for Pair Programming), an interactive AI assistant designed to support researchers working with the Einstein-Boltzmann solver CLASS. CLAPP leverages large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific retrieval to provide conversational coding support for CLASS-answering questions, generating code, debugging errors, and producing plots. Its architecture combines multi-agent LLM orchestration, semantic search across CLASS documentation, and a live Python execution environment. Deployed as a user-friendly web application, CLAPP lowers the entry barrier for scientists unfamiliar with AI tools and enables more productive human-AI collaboration in computational and numerical cosmology. The app is available at this https URL

 - **Abstract**
 A comprehensive account of the cosmic star-formation history demands an accurate census of dust-enshrouded star formation over cosmic time. We provide strong new constraints from a large sample of 777 red galaxies, selected based on their dust-reddened, rest-frame UV-optical emission. This sample of 777 galaxies spans $1 < z < 8$ and is selected from PRIMER JWST NIRCam and HST COSMOS optical data, ensuring robust colour criteria. The SEDs indicate that these dust-reddened galaxies are star-forming, with median $\mathrm{SFR \sim 40M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$ and stellar mass $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) = 10.3^{+0.6}_{-0.8}$; each exceeds the corresponding medians of the full JWST-detected population by over two dex. Our sample thus clearly shows that red galaxies dominate the high-mass end: they comprise 72 \% of galaxies with $\log(M/M_{\odot}) > 10$ at $z = 3.3$, rising to 91\% by $z \sim 7$ (albeit with large uncertainties at the highest redshifts). Crucially, we find that the number density of massive red star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 6$ is sufficient to explain the abundance of quiescent galaxies at $z > 3$, consistent with typical quenching timescales allowed in the $\mathrm{\sim 1Gyr}$ interval from $z \sim 6$ to $z \sim 3$. This large abundance yields a substantial contribution to the cosmic star-formation rate density: at $z \sim 4$, red galaxies provide $\mathrm {\rho_{SFR} = 3.9^{+0.6}_{-0.5} \times 10^{-2} M_{\odot} yr^{-1}Mpc^{-3}}$, and at $z \sim 5$ they supply nearly 40 \% of the total $\rho_{SFR}$. This exceeds the contribution of bright sub(mm)-selected dusty star-forming galaxies by more than an order of magnitude. Future deeper and wider ALMA surveys will provide further opportunities to strengthen and extend our results in our quest to fully quantify the contribution of dust-obscured activity to $\rho_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ at high redshifts.
#### Excavating The Ruins: an Ancient $z=2.675$ Galaxy Which Formed in the First 500 Myr

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of an ancient galaxy at $z=2.675$ which we dub ``Eridu.'' Simultaneously modeling the JWST/NIRSpec G140M and G235M spectra from the SMILES program and $0.4-25\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ HST, JWST/NIRCam, and JWST/MIRI photometry from the the JADES+SMILES photometric catalogs shows that Eridu is massive and quiescent with stellar mass $\log(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot})=10.96^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ and average star formation rate $<1\ \mathrm{M_\odot\ yr^{-1}}$ over the last 100 Myr. Star formation histories inferred from various models produce disconcertingly early and fast formation within $\sim300$ Myr of the Big Bang and quenching 2 Gyr prior to observation ($z\sim10$). This stellar mass assembly implies that the progenitor of Eridu had $M_*\approx10^{11}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$ at $z>10$, nearly two orders of magnitude more than the most massive current high redshift observations. From Eridu's spectrum we infer $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]} =+0.65^{+0.20}_{-0.19}$, indicating its stellar population is extremely $\alpha$-enhanced, which is consistent with the rapid formation timescale inferred from its star formation history. Eridu inhabits a massive protostructure which offers additional explanations for rapid mass assembly and quenching via environmental mechanisms, e.g. major mergers. Though its inferred formation is at odds with observations of the brightest cosmic dawn galaxies, we anticipate that future high-redshift galaxy formation models and sophisticated stellar population modeling codes will unearth how Eridu formed at the dawn of time.
#### Evidence for synchronisation of Gaia eclipsing binaries from their stellar rotational velocity

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia DR3 catalogue includes line-broadening (vbroad) measurements for 10,387 eclipsing binaries. In this study, we focus on a subset of 977 short-period main-sequence systems with primary radii between 1.25 and 3 solar radii, effective temperatures from 5600 to 8000 K, orbital periods between 0.3 and 3 days, vbroad values from 30 to 300 km/s, eclipse depth ratios below 0.7, and eccentricity indicators |e cos(omega)| less than 0.1. We find a clear inverse correlation between vbroad and orbital period, consistent with tidal synchronisation and spin-orbit alignment. Comparing the Gaia vbroad values with the expected rotational velocities based on stellar radii, we find that the measurements are generally consistent with rotational broadening, albeit with a systematic offset of approximately 10 percent.
#### Gravitational Binding and Star Formation in Molecular Clouds of the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational binding and star-forming properties of molecular clouds (MCs) in the Milky Way (MW) are estimated from CO cloud observations and from a model of pressure-bounded virial equilibrium (PVE). Two CO surveys are analyzed with the standard CO conversion factor. The main results are: (1) For each survey the cloud virial parameter $\alpha_{vir}$ increases by a factor ~2 from galactocentric radius $R_{gal}$ = 4 kpc to 15 kpc. (2) PVE models match these trends only if the surface densities of survey clouds and nearby stars are comparable. This evidence of environmental influence resembles that seen in other disk galaxies. (3) Many survey clouds form stars even though their virial parameter exceeds the critical value $\alpha_{vir}\approx2$. In PVE such clouds with constant velocity dispersion have stable equilibrium and cannot form stars by simple global collapse. (4) However, simulations show that $\alpha_{vir}\approx2$ clouds with dissipating turbulence may form filaments, cores and protostars with little global contraction. Such clouds can match the MW star formation rate if their protostellar cores have mass fraction ~10$^{-3}$. A simple model predicts that the star-forming age of a cloud is proportional to the ratio of its YSOs to its mass. (5) Clouds within ~500 pc of the Sun are predicted to have star-forming ages 1-10 Myr and average YSO age ~2 Myr, matching evolutionary models. The Orion A cloud is predicted to have ~60 Class 0 protostars, ~2900 YSOs and efficiency $SFE\approx0.02$, in good agreement with observed estimates.
#### Fast Radio Bursts from non-resonant Alfvén waves and synchrotron maser emission in the magnetar wind

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05840

 - **Abstract**
 Non-resonant interactions between Alfvén waves and a relativistic plasma result in the formation of the population inversions necessary for synchrotron maser emission (SME) across a wide range of magnetisations and temperatures. We calculate the peak frequencies of the SME resulting from this interaction and show that the characteristic frequencies and energetics of fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be produced in the relativistic wind of a magnetar using this mechanism. Wind Lorentz factors of $\gamma_w\gtrsim310$ are shown to be necessary to explain observed FRBs. Emission is possible at temperatures of $\theta = k_bT/mc^2\lesssim 0.02$. We further examine the periods and magnetic fields of the central magnetar and demonstrate that the optimal values of these properties align with the observed magnetar population provided that the magnetosphere is disturbed by the flaring activity. These results allow the properties of the environment such as temperature and magnetisation to be probed from the observed FRB frequency and luminosity.
#### The tidal interaction of an orbiting giant planet with a star near the Kraft break: the excitation of $r$-modes and the retention of orbital and spin angular momenta misalignment

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05894

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we extend the previous work of Papaloizou \& Savonije on tidal interactions between a solar mass star and a closely orbiting giant planet which is such that the orbital and stellar spin angular momentum directions are misaligned. Here we consider the situation when the central star has a mass of $1.3 M_{\odot}$ and is in the vicinity of the Kraft break. We find and determine the properties of the lowest order $r$ modes and the tidal response arising from the secular non axisymmetric forcing associated with a misaligned orbit. We find that the response of the thin convective envelope, as well as the shift of $r$ mode frequencies from the low rotation frequency, limit can be understood by adopting a vertically averaged model that is similar to the well known one governed by the Laplace tidal equation for an incompressible ocean. From our results we are able to estimate lower bounds on realignment time scales for hot Jupiter systems with orbital periods in the range $2.8-5 d$ and rotation periods in the range $5-31 d$ that indicate the process is indeed markedly less effective than for a solar type star. This is on account of there being less dissipation in a relatively smaller convective envelope as well as the generally faster rotation and hence larger spin angular momentum expected for the more massive star.
#### Evolution of magnetized hub-filament systems: Comparing the observed properties of W3(OH), W3 Main, and S 106

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we examine three cluster-forming hub-filament systems (HFS) - W3(OH), W3 Main, and S 106 - spanning evolutionary stages from early to advanced, with a focus on their magnetic field (B-field) structures and filament line-mass distributions. Our goal is to identify indicators of HFS evolution, particularly within their hubs, as star formation progresses. Our analysis combines observations of dense star-forming gas and young stellar populations. We present new JCMT/POL-2 observations of 850micron dust polarized emission to probe magnetic field morphology and dense gas structures. Archival infrared and radio data are also used to trace star formation activity. We derive radial column density profiles centered on the hubs to define distinct filament and hub regions. We then analyze histograms of line mass, polarization intensity (PI), polarization fraction (PF), and the relative orientation between B-fields and filaments. As HFS evolve, we observe changes in the filament line-mass function (FLMF), PF, and B-field-filament alignment - especially within the hub, which also increases in size. Massive bipolar outflows and radiation bubbles reshape the plane-of-sky B-fields, aligning them with cavity walls and shells, consistent with known rearrangements near HII regions. We also find a notable similarity between hub sizes and young cluster radii. "Double-node" star formation - where two subregions within a hub show different evolutionary stages - emerges as a common HFS feature. We present evidence for its widespread occurrence across several well-studied, nearby star-forming clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the second catalog of bright quasars from the All-sky BRIght, Complete Quasar Survey (AllBRICQS), focusing on spectroscopically observed quasars in the Northern Hemisphere with Galactic latitude $|b| > 10^\circ$. This catalog includes their spectral data, redshifts, and luminosities. AllBRICQS aims to identify the last remaining optically bright quasars using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and Gaia all-sky survey Data Release 3 (DR3). AllBRICQS searches for quasars that are brighter than $B_P = 16.5$ or $R_P = 16$ mag in Gaia DR3, based on simple selection criteria. Here, we report 62 new AllBRICQS quasars spanning various types, which include typical broad emission line quasars and the most luminous iron low-ionization broad absorption line quasars discovered to date. Spectroscopic observations were conducted using the Long-Slit Spectrograph on the 1.8-meter telescope at Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory, YFOSC on the 2.4-meter telescope at Lijiang Observatory, and BFOSC on the 2.16-meter telescope at Xinglong Observatory. We applied flux calibration using ZTF broadband photometry to correct for attenuation due to intermittent thin clouds during the observations. Redshifts were determined using inverse-variance weighted cross-correlation methods. Our targets span the bolometric luminosity range of $44.9<\log \left( L_{\rm bol} / {\rm erg~s^{-1}} \right)<48.0$ at redshifts between 0.09 and 2.48. These confirmed AllBRICQS quasars provide a valuable resource for future research into quasar evolution, black holes, their environments, and their host galaxies across multiple wavelengths.
#### Low-velocity large-scale shocks in the infrared dark cloud G035.39-00.33: bubble-driven cloud-cloud collisions

 - **Abstract**
 Low-velocity large-scale shocks impacting on the ISM may efficiently shape molecular clouds and trigger star formation within them. These shocks, both driven by galactic bubbles and/or cloud-cloud collisions, leave specific signatures in the gas morphology and kinematics. Observational studies of such signatures are crucial to investigate if and how shocks affect the clouds formation process and trigger their future star formation. We have analysed the shocked and dense gas tracers SiO(2-1) and H13CO+(1-0) emission toward the IRDC G035.39-00.33, using new, larger-scale maps obtained with the 30m telescope at the Instituto de Radioastronomìa Millimétrica. We find that the dense gas is organised into a northern and a southern filament having different velocities and tilted orientation with respect to each other. The two filaments are spatially separated yet connected by a faint bridge feature also seen in a position-velocity diagram extracted across the cloud. This bridge-feature, typical of cloud-cloud collisions, also coincides with a very spectrally narrow SiO-traced emission. The northern filament is suggested to be interacting with the nearby supernova remnant G035.6-0.4. Toward the southern filament, we also report the presence of a parsec-scale, spectrally narrow SiO emission likely driven by the interaction between this filament and a nearby expanding shell. The shell is visible in the 1.3 GHz and 610 MHz continuum images and our preliminary analysis suggests it may be the relic of a supernova remnant. We conclude that the two filaments represent the densest part of two colliding clouds, pushed toward each other by nearby Supernova Remnants. We speculate that this cloud-cloud collision driven by stellar feedback may have assembled the infrared dark cloud. We also evaluate the possibility that star formation may have been triggered within G035.39-00.33 by the collision.
#### Development of 1-D non-ideal MHD simulation code towards understanding Long-term Evolution of Protoplanetary Disk

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06089

 - **Abstract**
 We developed a one-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation code to investigate the long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks with low computational cost. In this simulation code, the physical processes necessary for protostellar formation and protoplanetary disk evolution, such as magnetic braking, non-ideal MHD effects, and angular momentum transport due to viscosity, are implemented. Using this simulation code, we performed the simulations of the long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks starting from the molecular cloud. Our simulation results suggest that the disk size and mass are a few tens of au and $\sim 0.01 M_\odot$ at $10^5$ years after protostellar formation. These values were relatively consistent with observations. The disk evolves through magnetic braking, and its radial profiles are consistent with the analytical solutions of previous studies. Our simulation code will be an important tool for studying the long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers are among the most energetic astrophysical phenomena, driving intense star formation and potentially fueling cosmic ray acceleration, which can produce high energy $\gamma$-ray emission through hadronic processes. We present a targeted search for $\gamma$-ray emission from five prominent galaxy merger systems, NGC~3256, NGC~660, UGC~813/816, UGC~12914/12915, and VV~114 using 16.8 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 1--300~GeV energy range. Employing a binned maximum likelihood analysis, we model the emission with power-law spectra and derive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to constrain $\gamma$-ray fluxes and spectral indices. Marginal detections are found for NGC~3256 (TS = 15.4, $\sim$3.51$\sigma$) and NGC~660 (TS = 8.16, $\sim$2.39$\sigma$), with photon fluxes of $(7.21 \pm 3.17) \times 10^{-11}$ and $(8.28 \pm 3.56) \times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively, suggesting merger driven star formation contributes to $\gamma$-ray emission. The remaining systems yield non-detections (TS $< 5$). This is the first targeted study of $\gamma$-ray emission from these aforementioned galaxy merger systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of GW230529 suggests that black hole-neutron star mergers may involve low-mass black holes, potentially producing detectable electromagnetic counterparts. Motivated by this, we perform eleven fully general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations with and without neutrino treatment, targeting the inferred chirp mass of GW230529. We systematically vary the black hole spin from $a_{\mathrm{BH}} = 0.0$ to $0.8$ in steps of $0.1$, making this the most comprehensive study of spin effects in black hole-neutron star mergers to date. We confirm our earlier findings of fast-moving ejecta ($v \geq 0.6\,c$) in this parameter regime and demonstrate a clear spin dependence, with fast-ejecta masses reaching up to $\qty{\sim e-3}{\Mass\Sun}$ for $a_{\mathrm{BH}} = 0.8$. Most notably, we identify for the first time the presence of spiral wave-driven ejecta in black hole-neutron star mergers -- a phenomenon previously reported only in binary neutron star systems. The mass of this component grows significantly with spin, reaching levels up to $\qty{\sim 7e-3}{\Mass\Sun}$. These results establish a new spin-enhanced mechanism for powering blue kilonova emission in black hole-neutron star mergers, significantly extending the range of systems expected to produce observable electromagnetic counterparts.
#### Revisiting the Gas Dynamics of Henize 2-10: Possible Drivers of the Starburst

 - **Abstract**
 The triggers of starburst episodes are a key component to our understanding of the baryon cycle in galaxies. Galaxy mergers are a commonly suggested catalyst for starbursts, but once the galaxies coalesce into a single kinematically disturbed system, their merger history can be difficult to assess. This is particularly true for dwarf galaxies, which are expected to dominate the merger rate at all redshifts due to their large numbers. One such dwarf galaxy undergoing an enigmatic starburst episode is Henize 2-10, which appears to be isolated. Possible scenarios that might have caused the starburst episode include a previous merger or stochastic processes within the galaxy itself, such as self-regulation via feedback processes. We present new VLA 21-cm observations and unpublished archival CARMA CO data to investigate the dynamical state and star formation activity in the galaxy. We do not detect an HI tail consistent with the structure reported by Kobulnicky et al. (1995), which was suggested as evidence for a merger or interaction, but rather these new observations indicate an extended HI distribution. We also find that the HI appears dynamically decoupled from an extended CO feature (inferred to be a tidal tail in previous work), suggesting large-scale dynamical processes of some type are affecting the gas in this system. We provide a meta-analysis of available results to enhance our understanding of what might be triggering the starburst episode in Henize 2-10, and speculate that the large CO feature could be falling into the galaxy and potentially trigger starburst activity.
#### One-third of Sun-like stars are born with misaligned planet-forming disks

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanets are organized in a broad array of orbital configurations that reflect their formation along with billions of years of dynamical processing through gravitational interactions. This history is encoded in the angular momentum architecture of planetary systems--the relation between the rotational properties of the central star and the orbital geometry of planets. A primary observable is the alignment (or misalignment) between the rotational axis of the star and the orbital plane of its planets, known as stellar obliquity. Hundreds of spin-orbit constraints have been measured for giant planets close to their host stars, many of which have revealed planets on misaligned orbits. A leading question that has emerged is whether stellar obliquity originates primarily from gravitational interactions with other planets or distant stars in the same system, or if it is primordial--imprinted during the star-formation process. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of primordial obliquities between the spin axes of young, isolated Sun-like stars and the orientation of the outer regions of their protoplanetary disks. Most systems are consistent with angular momentum alignment but about one-third of isolated young systems exhibit primordial misalignment. This suggests that some obliquities identified in planetary systems at older ages--including the Sun's modest misalignment with planets in the Solar System--could originate from initial conditions of their formation.
