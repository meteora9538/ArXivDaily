 - **Abstract**
 The faint radio-source population includes sources dominated both by star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN), encoding the evolution of activity in the Universe. To investigate its nature, we probabilistically classified 4,471 radio sources at z < 0.947 using low-frequency radio data from the LoTSS Deep Fields alongside a multi-component model for nebular emission, sampled by spectra obtained with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). This was done by combining three tools: (i) the identification of a radio excess, (ii) the BPT diagram, and (iii) a modified Mass Excitation diagram, alongside Monte Carlo methods to estimate the probability that each source is either a star-forming galaxy (SFG), a radio-quiet AGN (RQ AGN), or a high-\low-excitation radio galaxy (HERG or LERG). This approach extends the probabilistic classification framework of previous works by nearly doubling the redshift range, such that we can now probabilistically classify sources over the latter half of cosmic history. Often regarded as the 'gold standard' method, spectroscopic classifications allow us to evaluate the performance of other methods. Using a 90 per cent reliability threshold, we find reasonable overall agreement (~77 per cent) with state-of-the-art photometric classifications, but significant differences remain, including that we identify 2-5 times more RQ AGN. Furthermore, our high-confidence spectroscopic classifications show that radiatively-efficient and inefficient AGN exhibit clearly distinct Eddington-scaled accretion rate distributions, contrary to recent findings in the literature. Overall, our results highlight the need for new and forthcoming spectroscopic campaigns targeting radio sources, on the pathway to the SKA.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of Little Red Dots (LRDs) has largely been investigated through their continuum emission, with lines assumed to arise from a broad-line region. In this paper, we instead use recombination lines to infer the intrinsic properties of the central engine of LRDs. Our analysis first reveals a tension between the ionizing properties implied from H$\alpha$ and HeII$\,\lambda$4686. The high H$\alpha$ EWs require copious H-ionizing photons, more than the bluest AGN ionizing spectra can provide. In contrast, HeII emission is marginally detected, and its low EW is, at most, consistent with the softest AGN spectra. The low HeII/H$\beta$ ($\sim10^{-2}$, $<20\times$ local AGN median) further points to an unusually soft ionizing spectrum. We extend our analysis to dense gas environments (the ``black-hole star'' hypothesis), and find that hydrogen recombination lines become optically thick and lose diagnostic power, but HeII remains optically thin and a robust tracer. Photoionization modeling with Cloudy rules out standard AGN accretion disk spectra. Alternative explanations include: exotic AGN with red rest-optical emission; a very high {\it average} optical depth ($>10$) from gas/dust; and/or soft ionizing spectra with abundant H-ionizing photons, consistent with e.g., a cold accretion disk or a composite of AGN and stars. The latter is an intriguing scenario since high hydrogen densities are highly conducive for star formation, and nuclear star clusters are found in the immediate vicinity of local massive black holes. While previous studies have mostly focused on features dominated by the absorbing hydrogen cloud, the HeII-based diagnostic proposed here represents a crucial step toward understanding the central engine of LRDs.
#### The Impact of Radial Migration on Disk Galaxy SFHs: I. Biases in Spatially Resolved Estimates

 - **Abstract**
 Knowledge of the spatially resolved star formation history (SFH) of disk galaxies provides crucial insight into disk assembly, quenching, and chemical evolution. However, most reconstructions, both for the Milky Way and for external galaxies, implicitly assume that stars formed at their present-day radii. Using a range of zoom-in cosmological simulations, we show that stellar radial migration introduces strong and systematic biases in such SFH estimates. In the inner disk (R < h_d), early star formation is typically underestimated by 25-50% and late star formation overestimated, giving the misleading impression of prolonged, moderate activity. An exception occurs in the very central bin considered (~ 0.4h_d), which is consistently overestimated due to a net inflow of inward migrators. At intermediate radii and in the outer disk, migration drives the opposite trend: intermediate-age populations are overestimated by 100-200% as stars born in the inner disk migrate outward, whereas genuinely in-situ populations are underestimated by ~ 50% as they themselves continue to migrate. The net effect is that SFH peaks are suppressed and broadened, and the true rate of inside-out disk growth is systematically underestimated. These distortions affect all galaxies in our sample and have direct implications for interpreting spatially resolved SFHs from IFU surveys such as CALIFA and MaNGA, where present-day radii are often used as proxies for stellar birth sites. Correcting these biases will require accounting for disk mass, bar presence, disk kinematics and morphology, while recent birth-radius estimation techniques for Milky Way stars offer a promising path forward.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic investigation of the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) using uniform metallicity diagnostics across redshifts $z\sim0$ to $z\sim3.3$. We present new Keck/DEIMOS measurements of the [OII]$\lambda\lambda3726,3729$ emission line doublet for star-forming galaxies at $z\sim1.5$ with existing measurements of redder rest-optical lines from the MOSDEF survey. These new observations enable uniform estimation of the gas-phase oxygen abundance using ratios of the [OII], H$\beta$, and [OIII] lines for mass-binned samples of star-forming galaxies in 6 redshift bins, employing strong-line calibrations that account for the distinct interstellar medium ionization conditions at $z<1$ and $z>1$. We find that the low-mass power law slope of the MZR remains constant over this redshift range with a value of $\gamma=0.28\pm0.01$, implying the outflow metal loading factor ($\zeta_\text{out}=\frac{Z_{\text{out}}}{Z_{\text{ISM}}}\frac{\dot{M}_{\text{out}}}{\text{SFR}}$) scales approximately as $\rm \zeta_{out}\propto M_*^{-0.3}$ out to at least $z\sim3.3$. The normalization of the MZR at $10^{10}\ \text{M}_\odot$ decreases with increasing redshift at a rate of $d\log(\text{O/H})/dz =-0.11\pm0.01$ across the full redshift range. We find that any evolution of the FMR is smaller than 0.1 dex out to $z\sim3.3$. We compare to cosmological galaxy formation simulations, and find that IllustrisTNG matches our measured combination of a nearly-invariant MZR slope, rate of MZR normalization decrease, and constant or very weakly evolving FMR. This work provides the most detailed view of MZR and FMR evolution from the present day through Cosmic Noon with a fine time sampling of $1-3$ Gyr, setting a robust baseline for metallicity evolution studies at $z>4$ with JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are the evolved descendants of the most massive stars and show emission-line dominated spectra formed in their powerful stellar winds. Marking the final evolution stage before core collapse, the standard picture of WR stars has been that they evolve through three well-defined spectral subtypes known as WN, WC, and WO. Here, we present a detailed analysis of five objects that defy this scheme, demonstrating that WR stars can also evolve directly from the WN to the WO stage. Our study reveals that this direct transition is connected to low metallicity and weaker winds. The WN/WO stars and their immediate WN precursors are hot and emit a high flux of photons capable of fully ionizing helium. The existence of these stages unveil that high mass stars which manage to shed off their outer hydrogen layers in a low-metallicity environment can spend a considerable fraction of their lifetime in a stage that is difficult to detect in integrated stellar populations, but at the same time yields hard ionizing flux. The identification of the WN to WO evolution path for massive stars has significant implications for understanding the chemical enrichment and ionizing feedback in star-forming galaxies, in particular at earlier cosmic times.

 - **Abstract**
 The escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation from early galaxies transformed the intergalactic medium (IGM) and is intimately connected to the fueling and feedback processes that regulate galaxy evolution. IGM attenuation interferes with high-redshift LyC observations, but growing samples of LyC observations at z<0.1 are revealing the properties of LyC-emitting galaxies. Along with multi-wavelength observations of nearby LyC-emitting candidates, cosmological simulations, and simulations of LyC escape from star-forming clouds, recent studies are providing insights into the physics of LyC escape and the possible characteristics of the galaxies that reionized the universe. Here, I review progress in LyC detections, the inferred indirect signatures of LyC escape and their application to high redshift, and our current understanding of the physical conditions that lead to high LyC escape. These findings include: LyC-emitting populations are diverse, and multiple factors correlate with LyC escape, particularly neutral gas absorption, dust attenuation, nebular ionization, and concentrated star formation. Radiative feedback plays a critical role in the youngest starbursts with the highest LyC escape fractions, but mechanical feedback may also contribute. Further research is needed to clarify the timing and role of different feedback mechanisms and to connect local LyC-production sites with the broader interstellar medium. Indirect LyC diagnostics show promise, but we need to understand whether and how the properties of LyC-emitting galaxies evolve from low to high redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 If dark matter (DM) exists in halos around rotating neutron stars (NSs), it will be essential to understand the effects of rotation on the distribution of DM and baryonic matter (BM) in the stars to interpret observations. In this work, we construct rapidly rotating dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS) with DM halos using the two-fluid approximation, where the BM and DM interact only through gravity. Our goal is to describe rapidly rotating millisecond-period DANS spun up by the accretion of BM from a zero angular momentum state. We extend the Rapidly Rotating Neutron Star (RNS) code to compute axisymmetric configurations in which the BM rotates rigidly while the DM remains torque-free and differentially rotates through the frame-dragging of spacetime. For the first time, we examine in detail local and global definitions of mass in general relativity for two-fluid systems, showing how their differences affect the interpretation of baryonic and dark component masses. We compute energy density and frame-dragging frequency profiles for DANS with three different characteristic DM halos. We demonstrate that rapid BM rotation reduces DM halo sizes if central energy densities are kept constant between non-rotating and rotating models. We also construct sequences of DANS to create mass and radius curves and compare rotating and non-rotating cases. Finally, we quantify deviations in the spacetime metric outside the baryonic surfaces of these sequences of stars caused by the DM halos. We hypothesize that the size of this quantity could indicate whether a DM halo will significantly impact X-ray pulse profile modeling. These results provide a framework for assessing the observational consequences of DM halos around rapidly rotating NSs.
#### Impact of gravity on changing magnetic field orientations in a sample of massive protostellar clusters observed with ALMA

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic field is integral to our understanding of the formation and dynamical evolution of molecular clouds and star formation within. We present a polarimetric survey of 17 massive protostellar cluster forming clumps, covered in 34 pointings in the 230-GHz window using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The two array configurations, C43-1 and C43-4, probe linearly polarized dust emission, hence the plane-of-the-sky orientation of magnetic fields, at resolutions of 1\arcsec\ and 0\arcsec.4 that correspond to approximately 0.01pc core and $10^3$ au envelope scales, respectively. The relative orientations (ROs) of the magnetic field probed at two spatial scales are analyzed for the entire protostellar cluster sample and for a subset of objects in NGC 6334. We found a bimodal distribution of ROs with peaks at 0° (parallel) and 90°(orthogonal) for the entire sample combined as well as for NGC 6334. We investigate the physical origin of this bimodal distribution through a projected Rayleigh statistic (PRS) analysis in relation to column densities and local gravity in NGC 6334. We found an excess of parallel magnetic fields at column densities $> 10^{23}$ \cmm. The underlying cause of the RO distribution of the magnetic field is gravitational collapse at higher gas densities, which drags and reorients the magnetic field as shown in the alignment between the magnetic field and the direction of gravitational forces. The distribution of ROs observed here is consistent with the evolution of relative orientations of an initially sub-Alvénic cloud that becomes magnetically super-critical and super-Alvénic as the cloud collapses to form stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Differential heating and radiation on asymmetric asteroids can cause measurable changes in their rotation rates and spin axes, known as the YORP effect. In binary systems, such radiation-driven torques can change the mutual asteroid orbits, termed the binary YORP or BYORP effect. To study how binary asteroid shapes and thermophysical properties affect surface temperatures and BYORP, we developed a new 3D thermophysical model which balances insolation, 1D conduction, visible light reflection, and mutual heating through scattered infrared radiation. Using 3D ray tracing, we include eclipses, shadowing from horizons and topography, and mutual radiation exchange between the primary and secondary asteroids. We perform global modeling of the binary asteroid (175706) 1996 FG3, a Janus mission target. At perihelion, we find that the 1996 FG3 system experiences temperatures between 100 and 475 K. We find that eclipses and thermal inertia can alter secondary surface temperatures by up to 14%, with a mean difference due to radiation from the primary of just over 1%. We also present a model for calculating the BYORP effect using binary thermophysical model results. This model compares well to analytical approximations of the BYORP coefficient B, and suggests that thermal effects like eclipses and thermal inertia can reduce torque in the 1996 FG3 system and alter the BYORP coefficient by up to several percent. For 1996 FG3, eclipses alter B by approximately 7%, resulting in a lower torque on the secondary. Though small, in the absence of tidal effects this would reduce the contraction of the semimajor axis by about 20 meters over 10,000 years. Our findings suggest that thermal effects can alter temperatures and BYORP calculations sufficiently that they should be included when modeling binaries. The relative importance of each effect is predicted to vary with the properties of the studied system.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Quasar studies with Herschel/SPIRE often report host luminosities ranging from 10^{12} to 10^{14} Lsun, suggestive of star formation rates (SFRs) of up to several thousand Msun/yr. Due to the limited spatial resolution of SPIRE, it is uncertain whether the far-infrared (FIR) emission originates from the quasar itself, nearby sources, or unrelated sources within the SPIRE beam. High-resolution observations at wavelengths close to the SPIRE coverage are needed to pinpoint the true source of the FIR emission. In this work we unambiguously identify the ALMA Band 7 counterparts of a statistical sample of 152 FIR-bright SDSS quasars and estimate the multiplicity rates among these systems. Based on the multiplicities, we assess the importance of mergers as triggers for concomitant accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and extreme star formation. In ~60% of cases, the submm emission originates from a single counterpart within the SPIRE beam, centred on the optical coordinates of the quasar. The multiplicity rate increases by a factor of ~2.5 between redshifts 1 and 2.5. The incidence of multiplicities is consistent among broad absorption line (BAL) quasars and non-BAL quasars. The multiplicities observed in a fraction of the sample indicate that, while mergers enhance gas inflow efficiency, there must be viable alternatives for driving synchronous SMBH growth and intense star formation in isolated systems. We report the serendipitous detection of two CO(6-5) and three CO(7-6) transitions out of the eight such transitions expected based on the spectral setup and the redshifts of the objects in the sample. Higher transitions are not detected, indicating that the quasars are not exciting sufficiently the gas in their hosts. Finally, we also detect a potential emission of H2O, HCN (10-9) or a combination of both in the spectrum of a quasar at redshift 1.67.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Cosmic rays drive several key processes for the chemistry and dynamical evolution of star-forming regions. Their effect is quantified mainly by means of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate $\zeta_2$. Aims: We aim to obtain a sample of $\zeta_2$ measurements in 20 low-mass starless cores embedded in different parental clouds, to assess the average level of ionisation in this kind of sources and to investigate the role of the environment in this context. The warmest clouds in our sample are Ophiuchus and Corona Australis, where star formation activity is higher than in the Taurus cloud and the other isolated cores we targeted. Methods: We compute $\zeta_2$ using an analytical method based on the {column density} of ortho-$\rm H_2D^+$, the CO abundance, and the deuteration level of HCO$^+$. To estimate these quantities, we analysed new, high-sensitivity molecular line observations obtained with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) single-dish telescope and archival continuum data from Herschel. Results: We report $\zeta_2$ estimates in 17 cores in our sample and provide upper limits on the three remaining sources. The values span almost two orders of magnitude, from $1.3 \times 10^{-18}\, \rm s^{-1}$ to $8.5 \times 10^{-17}\, \rm s^{-1}$. Conclusions: We find no significant correlation between $\zeta_2$ and the core's column densities $N\rm (H_2)$. On the contrary, we find a positive correlation between $\zeta_2$ and the cores' temperature, estimated via Herschel data: cores embedded in warmer environments present higher ionisation levels. The warmest clouds in our sample are Ophiuchus and Corona Australis, where star formation activity is higher than in the other clouds we targeted. The higher ionisation rates in these regions support the scenario that low-mass protostars in the vicinity of our targeted cores contribute to the re-acceleration of local cosmic rays.

 - **Abstract**
 Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a distinct class of stellar explosions, exhibiting peak luminosities 10-100 times brighter than those of normal SNe. Their extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and its daughter $^{56}\mathrm{Co}$ alone. Consequently, models invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed, capable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For these rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may also contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early evolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within the optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes transparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve. In this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the combined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of SLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for magnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence suppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further investigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the lightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities. Our results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and radiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new insights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Observations suggest that magnetic fields of disk-bearing stars may have non-dipolar configurations. However, the influence of these configurations on magnetospheric accretion remains poorly understood. Aims: We aim to simulate magnetospheric accretion incorporating non-dipolar and strong magnetic field. Our model is informed by observations of IRAS 17449+2320, a post-merger belonging to the group of FS CMa stars, which indicate a dominant dipolar magnetic field with an additional quadrupole component. Methods: Using the PLUTO code, we conduct 2.5-D non-ideal viscous-resistive magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of star-disk magnetospheric interactions. We consider a thin accretion disk and strong stellar magnetic field ($B_\star= 6.2\mathrm{kG}$) under four configurations: pure dipole, pure quadrupole, dipole plus quadrupole, and dipole plus octupole. In the latter two cases, different magnetic polar strength ratios are explored. Results: For asymmetric magnetic field configurations, we find that accretion exhibits funnel streams below the midplane, indicating the dominance of the quadrupolar and octupolar components. In contrast, in dipolar configurations, we observe the formation of two symmetrical funnels with respect to the midplane. However, in the quadrupolar configuration, accretion is entirely confined to the disk midplane forming a cone-like pattern that leads to disk widening. Remarkably, the presence of a quadrupolar component gives rise to highly asymmetric substructures in the corona region. Conclusions: Multipolar stellar magnetic fields drive non-uniform accretion and lead to asymmetric density distributions in both the disk and corona. These results resemble observed features of some FS CMa post-mergers and Herbig Ae/Be stars, highlighting the critical role of magnetic field complexity in shaping circumstellar environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the galaxy bispectrum multipoles in the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model, where a scalar degree of freedom mediates a fifth force that is screened in high-density environments. The model is specified by $f_{R0}$, the present-day background value of the scalar field, which controls the strength of deviations from General Relativity (GR). Using perturbation theory, we compute the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum with the full scale- and time-dependent second-order kernels, incorporating corrections from the scale-dependent growth rate and nonlinear screening. Expanding the bispectrum in spherical harmonics, we analyze the sensitivity of the multipoles to modified gravity and forecast their detectability in a \textit{Euclid}-like survey. The monopole ($B_0^0$) and quadrupole ($B_2^0$) show the strongest signatures, with relative deviations of $2\%$-$8\%$ at $z=0.7$ and $k_1\simeq0.3\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for $f_{R0}=10^{-5}$. Higher multipoles provide weaker but complementary signals. Finger-of-God damping and galaxy bias significantly modulate the results, requiring joint modeling of these nuisance parameters. For \textit{Euclid}, we forecast signal-to-noise ratios up to $\sim30$ for the monopole and $\sim15$ for the quadrupole. These results demonstrate that bispectrum multipoles are a powerful probe of gravity, capable of breaking degeneracies with bias and velocity effects and strengthening constraints on deviations from $\Lambda$CDM.
#### Stellar Mass Assembly History of Massive Quiescent Galaxies since $z\sim4$: Insights from Spatially Resolved SED Fitting with JWST Data

 - **Abstract**
 Massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift show significantly more compact morphology than their local counterparts. To examine their internal structure across a wide redshift range and investigate potential redshift dependence, we performed spatially resolved SED fitting using pixedfit software on massive $(\log(M_*/M_\odot)\sim11)$ quiescent galaxies at $0<z<4$ with public James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope imaging data from the Public Release Imaging for Extragalactic Research and the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey. We find that at $z \sim 3.5$, the half-mass radius is about 5.4 times smaller than at $z \sim 0.5$. This growth is driven by stellar mass buildup in the outskirts ($r > 4$ kpc), while the central regions ($r \sim 1$ kpc) remain largely unchanged, with stellar mass surface density similar to local quiescent galaxies. The estimated star formation rates are too low to explain the stellar mass growth, indicating an additional stellar mass accumulation process, such as mergers, is necessary. We parameterize the size-mass relation of the most massive galaxies in our sample as $\log(R_{e,mass}) \propto \alpha \log(M_*)$, and find $\alpha = 2.67^{+1.14}_{-1.17}$ for $z\lessapprox2$, consistent with growth dominated by minor mergers, and $\alpha = 0.91^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ for $z\gtrapprox2$, consistent with growth dominated by major mergers. These results indicate that massive quiescent galaxies originate from compact quenched systems and grow through combinations of minor and major mergers.
