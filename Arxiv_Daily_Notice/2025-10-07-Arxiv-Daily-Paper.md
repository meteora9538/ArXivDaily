 - **Abstract**
 We report statistically significant detection of H I 21-cm emission from intermediate-redshift ($z\approx0.2$-0.6) galaxies. By leveraging multi-sightline galaxy survey data from the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS) and deep radio observations from the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS), we have established a sample of $\approx6000$ spectroscopically identified galaxies in 11 distinct fields to constrain the neutral gas content at intermediate redshifts. The galaxies sample a broad range in stellar mass -- $8\lesssim\log{M_\rm{star}/\rm{M}_\odot}\lesssim11$ with a median of $\langle\log{M_\rm{star}/\rm{M}_\odot}\rangle_\rm{med}\approx10$ -- and a wide range in redshift -- $0.24\lesssim z\lesssim0.63$ with a median of $\langle z\rangle_\rm{med}=0.44$. Our detected emission-line signal exceeds $4\,\sigma$ significance in the stacked spectra of all subsamples, and the observed total H I 21-cm line flux translates to a H I mass $M_\rm{H\;I}\approx10^{10}\rm{M}_\odot$. We find a high H I-to-stellar mass ratio of $M_\mathrm{H\;I}/M_\rm{star}\approx6$ for low-mass galaxies with $\langle\log{M_\rm{star}/\rm{M}_\odot}\rangle \approx9.3$ ($>3.7\,\sigma$). For galaxies with $\langle\log{M_\rm{star}/\rm{M}_\odot}\rangle\approx10.6$, we find $M_\mathrm{H\;I}/M_\rm{star}\approx0.3$ ($>4.7\,\sigma$). Additionally, the redshift evolution of H I mass in both low- and high-mass field galaxies, inferred from the stacked emission-line signal, aligns well with the expectation from the cosmic star formation history. This suggests that the overall decline in the cosmic star formation activity across the general galaxy population may be connected to a decreasing supply of neutral hydrogen. Finally, our analysis has revealed significant 21-cm signals at distances greater than 75 kpc from these intermediate-redshift galaxies, indicating a substantial reservoir of H I gas in their extended surroundings.

 - **Abstract**
 Young planetary systems are subjected to different dynamical effects that can influence their orbital structure over time. In systems with more than one planet, other planets can internally influence each other, e.g. via planet-planet scattering. External perturbing effects also need to be taken into account, as stars do not form by themselves but together with other stars in young star-forming regions. This birth environment can externally affect young multi-planet systems, e.g. via fly-bys. Previous work has shown that the absence/presence and location of an outer giant planet around a close-in planet system do not change how these inner planets react to a single fly-by with another star. We further explore this by comparing the effects of these external perturbations on four close-in sub-Neptune planets to those caused by a situation where only the distant giant is perturbed by the same kind of encounter. Our results indicate that the close-in planet systems have a "preferred" end state after 500 Myr, which is reached regardless of how it was perturbed. In addition, the mass of the giant appears not to impact the reaction of the inner planet system in the scenario of an external perturbation in our tested set-ups, i.e. either a single 1 or 5 M_Jup giant placed at 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 au. However, the mass affects the subsequent evolution of the inner planets if only internal perturbations by the giant are considered. The reduction in mass leads to an absence of collisions during the 500 Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are rare extragalactic events of unknown origin. Tidal disruptions of white dwarfs by intermediate mass black holes, mergers of black holes and Wolf-Rayet stars, and failed supernovae are among the suggestions. In this paper, we explore the viability of very massive star core-collapse events as the origin of LFBOTs. The appeal of such a model is that the formation of massive black holes via core collapse may yield observational signatures that can match the disparate lines of evidence that point towards both core-collapse and tidal disruption origins for LFBOTs. We explore the formation rate of massive black holes in population synthesis models, and compare the metallicities of their progenitors with the observed metallicities of LFBOT host galaxies. We further examine the composition, mass loss rates and fallback masses of these stars, placing them in the context of LFBOT observations. The formation rate of black holes with mass greater than ~30-40Msol is similar to the observed LFBOT rate. The stars producing these black holes are biased to low metallicity (Z<0.3Zsol), are H and He-poor and have dense circumstellar media. However, some LFBOTs have host galaxies with higher metallicities than predicted, and others have denser environments (plausibly due to late mass loss not captured in the models). We find that long-lived emission from an accretion disc (as implicated in the prototypical LFBOT AT2018cow) can plausibly be produced in these events. We conclude that (very) massive star core-collapse is a plausible explanation for LFBOTs. The preferred progenitors for LFBOTs in this scenario overlap with those predicted to produce super-kilonovae. We therefore suggest that LFBOTs are promising targets to search for super-kilonovae, and that they may contribute non-negligibly to the r-process enrichment of galaxies.
#### ALMA-IMF. XXI.: N$_2$H$^+$ kinematics in the G012.80 protocluster: Evidence for filament rotation and evolution

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) We aim to characterize kinematic processes in the G012.80 protocluster. We principally focus on the N$_2$H$^+$(1$-$0) emission to trace the dense and cold gas. Additionally, we use lines such as DCN(3$-$2), H41$\alpha$, C$^{18}$O(1$-$0), and SiO(5$-$4), as well as continuum maps. We perform a N$_2$H$^+$ hyperfine spectral line fitting to analyze multiple velocity components and spectral parameters. We estimate velocity gradients, column densities, and line-mass profiles for the two main filaments in G012, named R1 and R2. Line-mass profiles follow $\lambda$($\omega$) = 5660 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$($\omega$/pc)$^{0.30}$ (R1) and $\lambda$($\omega$) = 6943 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$($\omega$/pc)$^{0.20}$ (R2), which are much larger than those of typical low-mass filaments. R1 and R2 show disparate position-velocity (PV) features. R1 exhibits a transverse velocity gradient of 10.4 kms$^{-1} $pc$^{-1}$ and few dense cores. This gradient is interpreted with a simple rotation toy model, combined with line-mass profile, and corresponds to a rotational timescale of 0.1 Myr. In contrast, R2 exhibits compact velocity structures ($\Delta$V < 2 kms$^{-1}$), likely due to collapse, as evidenced by the presence of a comparatively large number of massive cores and protostellar outflows. R2 is forming prestellar and protostellar cores at a rate of 55.3 M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$, with an efficiency similar to the Orion Integral Shaped Filament (ISF). The R1 filament, in contrast, lacks protostellar cores and only contains a few prestellar cores, resulting in an estimated SFR of 4.2 M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$, more than an order of magnitude below that of R2. Combining these lines of evidence, we suggest that R1 is younger and still rotating, while R2 has evolved to collapse with a higher SFR. G012 thus hosts filaments at different evolutionary stages.

 - **Abstract**
 We study low angular momentum, advective accretion flows around a Kerr black hole within the framework of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) in the steady state. By solving the full set of GRMHD equations, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of magnetized plasma in the strong gravity regime near a rotating black hole. The accretion solutions are obtained for a set of input parameters, namely energy (${\cal E}$), angular momentum (${\cal L}$), magnetic flux ($\Phi$), and isorotation parameter ($I$). By systematically varying these parameters, we generate a family of global GRMHD accretion solutions that characterize the physical environment around the black hole. Using this approach, we investigate whether the inferred magnetic field strengths reported by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) for Sagittarius A$^*$ at various radii can be reproduced. We find that, for a broad range of parameter values, our model successfully recovers the EHT inferred magnetic field strengths with an accuracy of approximately $10\%$, offering a self-consistent framework for interpreting near-horizon accretion physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent near- and mid-infrared (IR) observations reveal the existence of appreciable amounts of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust in the harsh environments of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the origins of which are still under discussion. In this paper, we analyze the near-IR spectra of AGNs obtained with AKARI to systematically study the properties of the aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust a ected by the AGN activity. We perform the spectral fitting and the spectral energy distribution fitting for our sample of 102 AGNs to obtain the fluxes of the aromatic and aliphatic spectral features, the total IR luminosity (L_IR), and the fractional luminosity of AGN components (L_AGN/L_IR). As a result, we find that L_aromatic/L_IR is systematically lower for the AGN sample, especially much lower for AGNs with the aliphatic feature seen in the absorption, than for star-forming galaxies (SFGs), while L_aliphatic/L_aromatic is systematically higher for the AGN sample than for the SFG sample, increasing with the AGN activity indicated by L_AGN/L_IR. In addition, the profiles of the aliphatic emission features of the AGN sample are significantly di erent from those of the SFG sample in that the AGNs have the feature intensities systematically stronger at longer wavelengths. We conclude that both aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust are likely of circumnuclear origins, suggesting that a significant amount of the aliphatic hydrocarbon dust may come from a new population created through processes such as shattering of large carbonaceous grains by AGN outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 Methanol (CH$_{3}$OH) ice is abundant in space and is a key feedstock for seeding chemical complexity in interstellar and circumstellar environments. Despite its ubiquity, gas-phase methanol has only been detected in one disk around a Solar-type star to date, TW Hya. Here we present new high sensitivity (~1 mJy/beam) observations of TW Hya with ALMA that detect four individual transitions of gas-phase methanol spanning upper level energies from 17 to 38 K. We confirm the presence of gas-phase methanol in the luke-warm molecular layer of the disk ($35.9^{+25.9}_{-10.6}$ K) and with a disk-integrated column density of $1.8^{+1.3}_{-0.5}\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. A radially-resolved analysis suggests that the gas-phase methanol is centrally compact, peaking within the spatial extent of the mm-sized dust grains ($\lesssim 80$ au). Static gas-grain chemical disk models confirm photodesorption as an important mechanism releasing methanol into the gas phase, with the column density further boosted by the inclusion of grain-surface chemistry, reactive desorption, and an increase in dust-grain surface area assuming fractal grains. However, no model can fully reproduce the observed column density nor the radial distribution, and we suggest that the inclusion of dynamic processes such as vertical mixing and radial drift would be required to do so. Our results demonstrate that the abundance and distribution of the precursors for complex chemistry in the planet-forming regions around Solar-type stars is ultimately controlled by the interplay of grain surface chemistry coupled with the evolution of dust in their disks.

 - **Abstract**
 The role of spiral arms in galaxies -- whether they enhance star formation efficiency or primarily act as material gatherers -- remains an open question. Observational studies have yielded ambiguous results, in part due to the choice of star formation rate (SFR) tracers and their inherent limitations. These limitations are addressed here by applying multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to individual arm and interarm regions. We expand on our previous study of two galaxies to include six diverse galaxies, spanning over an order of magnitude in total stellar mass and factors of several in total SFR, for which spiral arms have been mapped. We find that the specific star formation rate (sSFR = SFR/M$_{star}$) can be used as a proxy for the star formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/M$_{gas}$), since the two quantities are directly proportional to each other in our regions. In our analysis of both tracers (sSFR and SFE) no significant difference is found the between arm and interarm regions, except for one galaxy (NGC 1097), supporting the gatherers scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 There is increasing observational evidence for a failed galaxy formation pathway for some ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) at low redshift however they currently lack simulated counterparts. We attempt to identify dark matter halos at high redshift within the MAGNETICUM cosmological simulations that could plausibly be their progenitors. We build a toy model of passive galaxy evolution within the stellar mass-halo mass relation to trace z = 0 observations of UDGs back to their z = 2 locations. We identify a population of 443 galaxies that match these parameter space positions within the simulation. We build two comparison samples within the simulation that follow the stellar mass-halo mass relationship at z = 2, one of which is stellar mass matched (with varying smaller halo masses) and the other is halo mass matched (with varying larger stellar masses) to our sample. We identify that our failed galaxy progenitor candidates have 1) flatter, cored dark matter halos; 2) more extended stellar bodies; 3) a larger fraction of their gas in the outskirts of their halos; 4) lower metallicities and 5) higher star formation rates than the control samples. Findings 1) and 2) are similar to low redshift observations of UDGs. Finding 3) will aid the removal of gas and permanent quenching of star formation which is a requirement of the failed galaxy formation scenario. The low metallicities of finding 4) match those observed in low redshift failed galaxy UDGs. Comparing the high star formation rates of finding 5) to recent JWST observations suggests that a starburst would naturally explain the high globular cluster richness of the UDGs. Many of the properties we find for these failed galaxy progenitors can be explained by an assembly bias of their dark matter halo to later formation times. We conclude by proposing that the fraction of failed galaxy UDGs is expected to increase with environmental density.

 The exponential growth of data in Astrophysics and Cosmology demands scalable computational tools and intuitive interfaces for analysis and visualization. In this work, we present an innovative integration of the VisIVO scientific visualization framework with the InterActive Computing (IAC) service at Cineca, enabling interactive, high-performance visual workflows directly within HPC environments. Through seamless integration into Jupyter-based science gateways, users can now access GPU-enabled compute nodes to perform complex 3D visualizations using VisIVO via custom Python wrappers and preconfigured interactive notebooks. We demonstrate how this infrastructure simplifies access to advanced HPC resources, enhances reproducibility, and accelerates exploratory workflows in astronomical research. Our approach has been validated through a set of representative use cases involving large-scale simulations from the GADGET code, highlighting the effectiveness of this system in visualizing the large-scale structure of the Universe. This work exemplifies how science gateways can bridge domain-specific tools and advanced infrastructures, fostering user-centric, scalable, and reproducible research environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of unexpectedly massive and luminous galaxies at redshifts $z \gtrsim 7$, posing a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological paradigm. In this work, we address the tension between early JWST observations of luminous high-redshift galaxies and predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by revisiting the physics of dark matter halo formation. Employing refined halo mass functions derived by Del Popolo \textit{et al.} (DP1 and DP2) that incorporate angular momentum, dynamical friction, and redshift-dependent collapse barriers, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in the abundance of massive halos at $z \gtrsim 7$ compared to the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) formalism. Using a semi-empirical framework linking halo mass to UV luminosity, we show that the DP2 model reproduces the observed UV luminosity functions from $z = 7$ to $14$ with moderate star formation efficiencies, whereas the ST model requires implausibly high efficiencies. Our results suggest that the JWST overabundance problem stems not from new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, but from oversimplified treatments of gravitational collapse, highlighting the critical role of small-scale dissipative dynamics in early structure formation.
#### A GLIMPSE into the very faint-end of the H$β$+[OIII]$λλ$4960,5008 luminosity function at z=7-9 behind Abell S1063

 - **Abstract**
 We use the ultra-deep GLIMPSE JWST/NIRCam survey to constrain the faint-end of the H$\beta$+[OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4960,5008 luminosity function (LF) down to $10^{39}$ erg/s at z=7-9 behind the lensed Hubble Frontier Field Abell S1063. We perform SED fitting on a Lyman-Break Galaxy sample, measuring combined H$\beta$+[OIII] fluxes to construct the emission-line LF. The resulting LF ($\alpha$=-1.55 to -1.78) is flatter than the UV LF ($\alpha<-2$), indicating a lower number density of low H$\beta$+[OIII] emitters at fixed MUV. We explore three explanations: (i) bursty star formation histories reducing the H$\beta$+[OIII]-to-UV ratio, (ii) metallicity effects on [OIII]/H$\beta$, or (iii) a faint-end turnover in the UV LF. Assuming an evolving [OIII]/H$\beta$ ratio, we derive a flatter [OIII]$\lambda$5008 LF ($\alpha$=-1.45 to -1.66) and a steeper H$\beta$ LF ($\alpha$=-1.68 to -1.95). The combination of decreasing metallicity and bursty star formation can reconcile the UV and H$\beta$+[OIII] LF differences. Converting the LF to the ionising photon production rate, we find that galaxies with H$\alpha$ flux $>10^{39}$ erg/s (SFR(H$\alpha$)$>5\times10^{-3} M_\odot$/yr) contribute 21-61% and 24-104% of the ionising photon budget at 7<z<8 and 8<z<9, respectively (for $f_{esc}=0.1$). The LF shape suggests faint galaxies contribute minimally to the ionising photon production rate. Our cosmic star formation rate density (CSFRD) estimates align with previous work, but GLIMPSE's sensitivity to low SFRs confirms that very faint galaxies are minor contributors to both the ionising photon production rate and the CSFRD. Our results suggest that GLIMPSE has detected the bulk of the total H$\beta$+[OIII] emission from star-forming galaxies, with fainter sources playing a limited role in cosmic reionisation.

 - **Abstract**
 We developed the full magnetohydrodynamical analytical jet model that allows accurate reproducing of a transversal and longitudinal structure for a highly collimated relativistic jets. This model can be used as a setup for convenient solution of radiative transfer equations and modelling the total intensity and polarization maps. We show that the analytical fits are in excellent agreement with the numerical solutions of full magnetohydrodynamical equations. Our approach allows setting easily different models for an emitting plasma number density. For example, we show that the equipartition number density ranges from several to tens of percent of a total number density. We show that the Doppler-corrected emissivity distribution behave in such a way that we may expect a limb brightened intensity pattern on a sub-parsec scale and a spine-brightened structure downstream. We reproduce the broken power-law dependence of a jet pressure at its boundary from the jet radius. The corresponding power exponents are in agreement with the parabola-to-cone transition observed directly in nearby sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Planets and their host stars form from the same cloud of gas and dust, so we assume that their chemical compositions are linked. However, a clear correlation between rocky planet interior properties and host star chemistry remains elusive for planets around FGK dwarfs, and non-existent for planets around M dwarfs because cool stars frequently lack detailed chemical information. Here, we investigate the relationship between small (R$_{P}$ $\leq$ 1.8 R$_{\oplus}$) planet densities and host star elemental abundances. We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V/Milky Way Mapper and an accompanying data-driven framework to obtain abundances for FGK and M dwarf hosts of 22 rocky planets. We find that planet densities exhibit a strong, inverse relationship to [Mg/Fe] abundances of FGK hosts (p = 0.001). This correlation becomes more significant with the addition of M dwarf hosts (p = 0.0005). If we assume that rocky planets have terrestrial-like compositions, this suggests that low [Mg/Fe] environments form planets with larger Fe-rich cores and thus higher densities. The thick disk planets in our sample help anchor this trend, illustrating the importance of sampling exoplanet properties across a range of host star populations. This finding highlights the connection between Galactic chemical evolution and rocky planet formation, and indicates that Earth-like planet compositions may vary significantly across different regions of the Galaxy.
#### Spectral Properties of Anomalous Microwave Emission in 144 Galactic Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) is a diffuse microwave component thought to arise from spinning dust grains, yet remains poorly understood. We analyze AME in 144 Galactic clouds by combining low-frequency maps from S-PASS (2.3 GHz), C-BASS (4.76 GHz), and QUIJOTE (10-20 GHz) with 21 ancillary maps. Using aperture photometry and parametric SED fitting via MCMC methods without informative priors, we measure AME emissivity, peak frequency, and spectral width. We achieve peak frequency constraints nearly three times tighter than previous work and identify 83 new AME sources. AME spectra are generally broader than predicted by spinning dust models for a single phase of the interstellar medium, suggesting either multiple spinning dust components along the line of sight or incomplete representation of the grain size distribution in current models. However, the narrowest observed widths match theoretical predictions, supporting the spinning dust hypothesis. The AME amplitude correlates most strongly with the thermal dust peak flux and radiance, showing $\sim30$% scatter and sublinear scaling, which suggests reduced AME efficiency in regions with brighter thermal dust emission. AME peak frequency increases with thermal dust temperature in a trend current theoretical models do not reproduce, indicating that spinning dust models must incorporate dust evolution and radiative transfer in a self-consistent framework where environmental parameters and grain properties are interdependent. PAH tracers correlate with AME emissivity, supporting a physical link to small dust grains. Finally, a log-Gaussian function provides a good empirical description of the AME spectrum across the sample, given current data quality and frequency coverage.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we use data from multi-scale galactic MHD simulations to observe filaments and star forming clumps on 10's of pc scales and investigate flow rate relationships along, and onto filaments as well as flows towards the clumps. Using the FilFinderPPV identification technique, we identify the prominent filamentary structures in each data cube. Each filament and its corresponding clump are analysed by calculating flow rates along each filament towards the clump, onto each filament from increasing distances, and radially around each clump. This analysis is conducted for two cubes, one feedback dominated region, and one with less feedback. Looking at the face-on inclination of the simulations (0 degrees), we observe different trends depending on the environmental conditions (more or less feedback). The median flow rate in the region with more feedback is 8.9$\times$10$^{-5}$ M$_{sun}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and we see that flow rates along the filaments toward the clumps generally decrease in these regions. In the region with less feedback we have a median flow rate of 2.9$\times$10$^{-4}$ M$_{sun}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and when looking along the filaments here we see the values either increase or remain constant. We find that the flow rates from the environments onto the primary filaments are of an order of magnitude sufficient to sustain the flow rates along these filaments. When discussing the effects of galactic and filamentary inclination, we also observe that viewing the filaments from different galactic inclinations can reveal the presence of feeder structures (smaller filamentary structures aiding in the flow of material). The method used to estimate these flow rates, which has been previously applied to observational data, produced results consistent with those obtained from the simulations themselves, providing high confidence in the flow rate calculation method.
