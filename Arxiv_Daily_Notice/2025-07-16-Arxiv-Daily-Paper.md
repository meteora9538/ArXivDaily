 - **Abstract**
 Merger trees track the hierarchical assembly of dark matter halos across cosmic time and serve as essential inputs for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. However, conventional methods for constructing merger trees rely on ad-hoc assumptions and are unable to incorporate environmental information. Nguyen et al. (2024) introduced FLORAH, a generative model based on recurrent neural networks and normalizing flows, for modeling main progenitor branches of merger trees. In this work, we extend this model, now referred to as FLORAH-Tree, to generate complete merger trees by representing them as graph structures that capture the full branching hierarchy. We trained FLORAH-Tree on merger trees extracted from the Very Small MultiDark Planck cosmological N-body simulation. To validate our approach, we compared the generated merger trees with both the original simulation data and with semi-analytic trees produced using the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism. We show that FLORAH-Tree accurately reproduces key merger rate statistics across a wide range of mass and redshift, outperforming the conventional EPS-based approach. We demonstrate its utility by applying the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model (SAM) to generated trees and showing that the resulting galaxy-halo scaling relations, such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation and supermassive black hole mass-halo mass relation, closely match those from applying the SAM to trees extracted directly from the simulation. FLORAH-Tree provides a computationally efficient method for generating merger trees that maintain the statistical fidelity of N-body simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We build upon FEGA25 (Contini et al 2025), a previously introduced semi-analytic model for galaxy formation and evolution, focusing on its enhanced treatment of supernova and active galactic nucleus feedback mechanisms. In addition to the traditional AGN feedback modes, negative (suppressing cooling), and the new positive mode (triggering star formation), we introduce two implementations of a third mode: the ejection of hot gas beyond the virial radius, AGNeject1 and AGNeject2. This component addresses a longstanding issue in semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations: the overestimation of hot gas fractions in low and intermediate mass halos. FEGA25 is calibrated via MCMC using a suite of cosmological N-body simulations YS50HR, YS200, and YS300, and a comprehensive set of observed stellar mass functions across a wide redshift range. We find that supernova feedback dominates gas ejection in halos with logM_{halo} < approximately 12, while AGN feedback becomes increasingly important at higher halo masses. The AGNeject2 model, which activates primarily at late times, redshift < 1, reproduces a characteristic cavity, a U shaped feature in the baryon fraction at redshift zero, similar to trends observed in simulations like SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. Conversely, AGNeject1 yields a smoother, redshift independent evolution. Both models preserve the stellar and cold gas components and successfully reproduce the stellar to halo mass relation up to redshift 3. Our results emphasize that a physically motivated AGN driven mechanism capable of selectively removing hot gas is essential to accurately model the baryon cycle, particularly in intermediate halo mass regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the most luminous and obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) detected in the ultra-hard X-ray band (14-195 keV) by Swift/BAT. Our sample comprises 21 X-ray luminous (log $L_X/{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}>44.6$, 2-10 keV) AGNs at $z<0.6$, optically classified as Seyfert 1.9-2. Using NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, Suzaku, and Chandra, we constrain AGN properties such as absorption column density $N_H$, photon index $\Gamma$, intrinsic $L_X$, covering factor, and iron K$\alpha$ equivalent width. For sources with black hole mass estimates (12/20), we find a weak correlation between $\Gamma$ and Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{Edd}$). Of these, six ($50\pm13\%$) lie in the $N_H$-$\lambda_{Edd}$ "forbidden region'' and exhibit a combined higher prevalence of $N_H$ variability and outflow signatures, suggesting a transitional phase where AGN feedback may be clearing the obscuring material. For the 13/21 sources with multi-epoch X-ray spectra, $82^{+6}_{-16}\%$ exhibit variability in either 2-10 keV flux ($73^{+9}_{-16}\%$) or line-of-sight $N_H$ ($33^{+15}_{-10}\%$). For the 20/21 sources with available near-UV/optical spectroscopy, we detect [NeV]$\lambda$3426 in 17 ($85^{+5}_{-11}\%$), confirming its reliability to probe AGN emission even in heavily obscured systems. When normalized to the same [OIII]$\lambda$5007 peak flux as $z = 2$-$9$ narrow-line AGNs identified with JWST, our sample exhibits significantly stronger [NeV]$\lambda$3426 emission, suggesting that high-redshift obscured AGNs may be intrinsically weaker in [NeV]$\lambda$3426 or that [NeV]$\lambda$3426 is more challenging to detect in those environments. The sources presented here serve as a benchmark for high-redshift analogs, showing the potential of [NeV]$\lambda$3426 to reveal obscured AGNs and the need for future missions to expand X-ray studies into the high-redshift Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We model the wavelength dependence of structural parameters for a mass-limited sample ($M_\star>10^{10}M_\odot$) of $\sim27,000$ quiescent galaxies with $0.2 < z < 0.6$ using $grizy$ photometry from Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam and dense spectroscopy from the HectoMAP survey. Based on Sérsic profile fits in all five bands, we estimate the circularized half-light radius $R_{e,c}$ and Sérsic index $n$ in two rest-frames: UV (3500 Å) and red (7000 Å). Combined with $M_\star$, $z$, and D$_n4000$, $R_{e,c}$ and $n$ enable exploration of the evolution in the structural properties - stellar mass correlations for quiescent galaxies with different stellar population ages. At intermediate redshift, quiescent galaxies at all stellar masses show a systematic decline in $R_{e,c}$ and rise in $n$ with rest-frame wavelength. These structural variations are stronger for galaxies that recently joined the quiescent population (newcomers) than for the descendants of galaxies that are already quiescent at the survey limit, $z \sim 0.6$ (aging population). The combined evidence supports inside-out quenching as the dominant mechanism halting star formation during this epoch. The typical size of a $M_\star\sim10^{11}M_\odot$ quiescent galaxy increases by $\sim30\%$ between $z \sim 0.6$ and $z \sim 0.2$ in the red and remains constant in the UV; newcomers are $\sim20\%$ larger than the aging population. In the UV, quiescent galaxies maintain a constant $n\sim4$ for the aging population and $n\sim2$ for newcomers; in the red, both subpopulations have de Vaucouleurs profiles. Our findings link newcomers to their direct progenitors in the star-forming population. For the aging population, we suggest minor mergers with progressively redder satellites at lower redshifts as the primary driver of quiescent galaxy evolution. Forthcoming sensitive large-area imaging surveys will allow testing this prediction.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have unveiled a population of pulsars with spin periods of a few minutes to hours that lie beyond the traditional ``death line.'' If they originate from neutron stars (NSs), the existence of such ultra-long period pulsars (ULPs) challenges our current understanding of NS evolution and emission. In this work, we propose a new channel for disk formation based on NSs born in close binaries with main-sequence companion stars. Using a hydrodynamic simulation of supernova-companion interactions, we show that a newborn NS may gravitationally capture gas as it moves through the complex density field shaped by the explosion. For a binary separation of $20\rm~R_\odot$ and a companion mass of $4\rm~M_\odot$, we find the occurrence fraction for disk formation around unbound NSs to be $\sim10\%$. By modeling the disk evolution and its interaction with the NS, we find a bimodal distribution in spin periods: canonical pulsars with $P\lesssim10\rm\,s$ are the ones who lack disks or whose magnetospheres never interacted with the disk, and ULPs with $10^3\lesssim P<10^5\rm\,s$ are produced when the system undergoes a short-lived ``propeller'' phase during which the NS undergoes rapid spin-down. Such ULPs are formed under strong initial dipolar magnetic field strengths $B_0\gtrsim10^{14}\rm\,G$, with a formation rate of $10^{-4}\rm\,yr^{-1}$ in the Milky Way. We also find that a small population of pulsars with moderate magnetic field strengths ($10^{13}\lesssim~B_0\lesssim10^{14}\rm\,G$) and relatively slow initial periods ($P_0\gtrsim0.1\rm\,s$) evolve to $P\sim10^2\rm\,s$, filling the gap between the bimodal distribution. Thus, our model provides a unified explanation for pulsars beyond the ``death line.''

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous astrophysical transients, known to be associated with core collapse of massive stars or mergers of two compact objects such as two neutron stars. They are followed by multi-wavelength afterglow emission originating from the deceleration of the relativistic jets by the ambient medium. The study of after emission offers crucial insights into the physics of relativistic shocks, the properties of the circumburst environment, as well as the physical and geometrical structure of relativistic jets, as well as the viewing geometry of the observer. We present VegasAfterglow, a newly developed, high-performance C++ framework designed for modeling GRB afterglows with flexibility and computational efficiency as keynotes of design. The framework self-consistently solves forward and reverse shock dynamics and calculates synchrotron (including self-absorption or all spectral regimes) and inverse Compton radiation (including Klein-Nishina corrections); it can handle arbitrary user-defined ambient density profiles, central engine activity histories, viewing angles, and the jet structures of energy, Lorentz factor, and magnetization profiles. It supports both relativistic and non-relativistic regimes and includes lateral jet spreading effects. In this paper, we describe the numerical implementation of the framework and assess its computational performance. Our results demonstrate that VegasAfterglow is well-suited for interpreting current and future multi-wavelength observations in the era of multi-messenger astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies suggest that the angular momentum evolution of late-M and brown dwarfs differs from the well-known spin-down evolution of hotter stars. Characterizing the distribution of rotation periods of these objects in the solar neighborhood can help elucidate this evolutionary pathway just above, at, and below the hydrogen burning limit. In this paper, we examine 399 candidate single late-M dwarfs with $G - G_{RP} \geq 1.4$ mag ($\gtrsim$M6) using TESS light curves. To determine rotation periods, we employed Lomb-Scargle Periodograms to provide a first estimate of the period, then refined them with a Gaussian Process approach, requiring multi-sector confirmation when available. We found 133 rotation periods, ranging from 2 hours to 6 days, and amplitudes between 0.08% and 2.71%. We find that the observed variability fraction in late-M dwarfs rises with the number of available TESS sectors, approaching an apparent ceiling of ~50%. This likely reflects a detection limit determined by viewing geometry and supports the idea that spot-induced variability is common across the late-M and brown dwarf population. In our comparison with previously published late-M dwarf rotation periods reported, we found consistent results, confirming or updating 31 periods. Our findings expand the number of previously known late-M dwarf periods under 1 day by 76%. Combined with published rotation periods for a broader range of spectral types, we find a lower envelope on the rotation period decreasing from 5 hours at early-M dwarfs to 1 hour at L, T, and Y dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations and theoretical simulations suggest that the large scale environment plays a significant role in how galaxies form and evolve and, in particular, whether and when galaxies host an actively accreting supermassive black hole in their center (i.e., an Active Galactic Nucleus, or AGN). One signature of AGN activity is luminosity variability, which appears in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) when circumnuclear dust reprocesses UV and optical photons from the AGN accretion disk. We present here a suite of constraints on the fraction of AGN activity in the most underdense regions of the universe (cosmic voids) relative to the rest of the universe (cosmic walls) by using ~12 years of combined multi-epoch data from AllWISE and NEOWISE to quantify mid-IR variability. We find clear evidence for a larger mid-IR variability-AGN fraction among high and moderate-luminosity void galaxies compared to their wall counterparts. We also show that mid-IR variability identifies a rather large and unique population of AGNs, the majority of which have eluded detection using more traditional AGN-selection methods such as single-epoch mid-IR color selection. The fraction of these newly-recovered AGNs is larger among galaxies in voids, suggesting once again more prolific AGN activity in the most underdense large scale structures of the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The Ly$\alpha$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS) has produced large 3D maps of the intergalactic medium (IGM), providing a new window on the cosmic web at $z\sim2.5$. A key advantage of Ly$\alpha$ tomography is that it enables the discovery of overdense regions without the need to detect their galaxy members in spectroscopic surveys, circumventing possible selection biases. We use these maps to identify 37 IGM-selected overdensities as regions of strong and spatially coherent Ly$\alpha$ absorption. Simulations indicate that 85% of these are protoclusters, defined as the progenitors of $z=0$ halos with mass $M_{\rm desc} > 10^{14} M_{\odot}$, and that nearly all of the rest are protogroups ($10^{13.5} < M_{\rm desc} / M_{\odot} < 10^{14}$). We estimate the masses and space densities of the IGM-selected overdensities and show they are in accordance with mock surveys. We investigate the LATIS counterparts of some previously reported protoclusters, including the proto-supercluster Hyperion. We identify a new component of Hyperion beyond its previously known extent. We show that the Ly$\alpha$ transmission of the galaxy density peaks within Hyperion is consistent with a simple physical model (the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation), suggesting that active galactic nucleus feedback or other processes have not affected the large-scale gas ionization within this structure as whole. The LATIS catalog represents an order-of-magnitude increase in the number of IGM-selected protogroups and protoclusters and will enable new investigations of the connections between galaxies and their large-scale environments at cosmic noon.
#### LATIS: Comparing Galaxy and IGM Tomography Maps as Tracers of Large-scale Structure and Protoclusters at $z \sim 2.5$

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the consistency of intergalactic medium (IGM) tomography and galaxy surveys as tracers of the cosmic web and protoclusters at $z \sim 2.5$. We use maps from the Ly$\alpha$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS), which trace the distributions of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) and IGM Ly$\alpha$ absorption on $\simeq 4$ $h^{-1}$ cMpc scales within the same large volume. Overall, the joint distribution of IGM absorption and LBG density is well constrained and accurately described by a simple physical model. However, we identify several exceptional locations exhibiting strong IGM absorption indicative of a massive protocluster, yet no coincident overdensity of LBGs. As discussed by Newman et al., whose results we revise using the complete LATIS survey data, these are candidate ultraviolet (UV)-dim protoclusters that may harbor distinct galaxy populations missed by rest-UV spectroscopic surveys. We present follow-up observations targeting one such candidate embedded within Antu, an extended region of IGM absorption at $z=2.685$ that contains five IGM-selected protoclusters and has a total mass of $3 \times 10^{15}~M_{\odot}$. Ly$\alpha$ emitters trace the overall structure of Antu but avoid the center of the candidate UV-dim protocluster, which also appears to contain no submillimeter-selected sources. A near-infrared spectroscopic galaxy census is needed to determine whether this large region is dominated by galaxies with reduced or absent star-formation activity. This work adds to a growing and puzzling literature on discrepancies among different galaxy and IGM tracers, whose resolution promises to shed light on the early stages of environment-dependent galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical mechanisms that regulate the collapse of high-mass parsec-scale clumps and allow them to form clusters of new stars represent a crucial aspect of star formation. To investigate these mechanisms, we developed the Rosetta Stone project: an end-to-end (simulations-observations) framework that is based on the systematic production of realistic synthetic observations of clump fragmentation and their comparison with real data. In this work, we compare ALMA 1.3mm continuum dust emission observations from the SQUALO survey with a new set of 24 radiative magnetohydrodynamical simulations of high-mass clump fragmentation, post-processed using the CASA software to mimic the observing strategy of SQUALO. The simulations were initialized combining typical values of clump mass (500,1000 solar masses) and radius (~0.4pc) with two levels of turbulence (Mach number of 7,10) and three levels of magnetization (mass-to-flux ratio of ~3,10,100). Following the clump evolution over time with two random seeds projected along three orthogonal directions, we produced a collection of 732 synthetic fields. The synthetic observations of clump fragmentation at ~7000AU revealed between 2 and 14 fragments per field. Among the initial conditions of the simulations, magnetic fields have the largest impact on the fragment multiplicity at these scales. In advanced stages of clump evolution, a lower number of fragments is preferentially associated with magnetized clumps. Fragments identified at ~7000AU correspond to individual or multiple sink particles in ~75% of the cases, suggesting that not all fragments are actively forming stars. Both sinks and fragments accrete mass throughout the whole clump evolution, favoring a scenario in which fragments are not isolated from the environment. Our study demonstrates the importance of synthetic observations in interpreting results from interferometric observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Young, solar-like stars in the pre-main sequence (PMS) stage exhibit vigorous magnetic activity that significantly influences their circumstellar environments and the processes of planetary formation and evolution. In binary systems, tidal forces and magnetic interactions can further shape the magnetic geometry. We report a longitudinal preference of star spots, chromospheric activities, and flares in the active single-lined spectroscopic PMS binary system V2279 Cyg, based on long-term photometric observations from \textit{Kepler} and \textit{TESS} alongside spectroscopic data from LAMOST. The system is classified as a weak-line T Tauri binary, with component masses estimated at 0.86 $M_\odot$ and 0.27 $M_\odot$. V2279 Cyg's nearly circular orbit is synchronized with its 4.126-day rotational period. Observations reveal large star spot regions clustered near the far-side hemisphere. Spectroscopic data show strong, double-peak H$\alpha$ emission, the strength of which is highly correlated with star spot distribution, indicating the presence of an active longitude on the primary star. We also mapped the prominence structure co-rotating with the primary star, suggesting a dense structure close to the near-side hemisphere. Furthermore, we identify an inactive longitude of flares during the 4-year \textit{Kepler} observations, where the frequency of flare activity is significantly reduced after the superior conjunction, marking the first such identification in active binary systems. Additionally, a white light superflare, releasing energy of $2.5 \times 10^{37}$ erg, was detected in \textit{TESS} observations. These findings provide valuable insights into the magnetic field geometry and dynamo processes in PMS binaries, underscoring the critical role of tidal interactions in shaping magnetic activities.

 - **Abstract**
 A newly born millisecond magnetar has been proposed as one possible central engine of some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with X-ray plateau emission. In this work, we systematically analyzed the \emph{Swift}/XRT data of long GRBs with plateau emission that were detected before 2023 December, and estimated the magnetar parameters by considering the $R/I$ evolutionary effects, and investigated possible relationships among these parameters and their relation to the GRB jet and magnetar wind radiation. We found that neglecting the evolutionary effects of $R/I$ can lead to systematic overestimation or underestimation of magnetar parameters such as magnetic field strength ($B_p$), spin period ($P_0$), and ellipticity ($\epsilon$) from 20% to 50%. We also found that some tight correlations among different magnetar parameters, as well as between the GRB jet emission and the magnetar wind emission for our selected Equation of states (EoSs). The universal correlations suggest that a nascent magnetar with the faster $P_0$, lower $B_p$, and lower $\epsilon$ are more inclined to power more energetic GRB jet, and the ellipticity deformation and initial spin period of newborn magnetar are likely to originate from the magnetically-induced distortion and correspond to the equilibrium spin period as a result of interaction between the magnetar and its accretion disk, respectively. Finally, we found that the GW signals from the remnants of those GW-dominated GRBs with redshift measurements cannot reach aLIGO sensitivity threshold, and only two cases (GRBs 150323A and 170607A) can reach ET sensitivity threshold. Future GW observations could not only offer the first smoking gun that a protomagnetar can serve as the central engine of GRBs, but could also play a crucial role in precisely constraining the neutron EoS.

 - **Abstract**
 HF QPOs are among the most intriguing phenomena observed in LMXBs containing BHs or neutron stars. In this work, we investigate charged particles' dynamics in the nearby of a Schwarzschild-like BH embedded in a uniform magnetic field and surrounded on all sides by CDM. Thereby gaining deeper insight into the influence of magnetic and DM distributions on observable phenomena near compact objects. We first present a modified metric, which incorporates the effects of a CDM ... We compute the fundamental oscillation frequencies-radial, latitudinal, Keplerian, and Larmor-and demonstrate how their variation depends on the combined influence of CDM and magnetic field strength. The resulting frequency structure allows us to identify resonance radii associated with HF QPOs, particularly those in 3:2 ratios observed in microquasars. We assess several theoretical models for QPO generation, including the (ER), Relativistic Precession (RP), Tidal Disruption (TD), and Warped Disk (WD) models. A comparative fit of observational data from GRS 1915+105, H1743-322, XTE 1550-564, and GRO 1655-40 demonstrate that the TD and WD models provide the best match for HF QPOs in the presence of moderate magnetic flux ($B' = 0.1$), while the other models except ER fit better in weak-field scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of including both magnetic and dark matter (DM) effects in strong-field astrophysics and support the use of HF QPOs as sensitive probes of BH environments. This study opens new perspectives for exploring particle dynamics, accretion disk structure ...

 - **Abstract**
 In triple systems of weak hierarchies, nonlinear perturbations arising from the periodic oscillations associated with the inner and outer binaries play a crucial role in shaping their long-term dynamical evolution. In this context, we have developed an extended Brown Hamiltonian in Paper I, which serves as a fundamental model for describing the modified von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations. The present work aims to analyze the characteristics of ZLK oscillations within this extended framework, focusing on phase-space structures, the location of ZLK center, the maximum eccentricity reached, the boundaries of librating cycles, and the critical inclination required to trigger ZLK resonance. Under the extended Hamiltonian, we introduce the Lidov integral C_ZLK, which is a combination of the Hamiltonian and the z-component of angular momentum, to characterize the modified ZLK properties. It is found that the librating and circulating cycles are separated by C_ZLK=0, which is consistent with the classical theory. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions of these ZLK properties using perturbation techniques. Analytical predictions are compared to numerical results, showing an excellent agreement between them. Notably, the results reveal that ZLK characteristics in prograde and retrograde regimes are no longer symmetric under the influence of Brown corrections. At last, we conduct $N$-body integrations about millions of orbits to generate dynamical maps, where the numerical structures are well captured by the analytical solutions derived from the extended model.

 - **Abstract**
 In the framework of exploiting Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations of extragalactic sources to infer constraints on the intensity of cosmological background radiations, as well as on deviations from the standard model of particles and physical interactions (like violations of Lorentz invariance and axion-like particles -- LIV and ALPs), we discuss here possible contaminant effects due to the presence of radiations fields from local sources. We specifically model and analyze the foreground radiations produced inside the host galaxy of the VHE source and the cosmic environment itself hosting the source, as well as radiations produced in the Milky Way, along the VHE source's observational line-of-sights. Our analysis shows that such contaminant foregrounds may indeed impact on observations of only the very local Active Galactic Nuclei (e.g. Centaurus A), but not significantly those in the Virgo cluster (M87) and beyond.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) interacting with molecular clouds are interesting laboratories to study the acceleration of cosmic rays and their propagation in the dense ambient medium. We analyze 14 years of Fermi-LAT observations of the supernova remnant Puppis A to investigate its asymmetric $\gamma$-ray morphology and spectral properties. This middle-aged remnant ($\sim$4 kyr) is evolving in an inhomogeneous environment, interacting with a dense molecular cloud in the northeast and a lower-density medium in the southwest. We find clear differences in both $\gamma$-ray luminosity and spectral energy distribution between these two regions. The emission from both sides is consistent with a hadronic origin. However, while the southwestern emission can be explained by standard Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA), the northeastern side may involve re-acceleration of pre-existing cosmic rays or acceleration via reflected shocks in the dense cloud environment. Additionally, we identify two significant $\gamma$-ray excesses outside the remnant, including a previously unreported source to the south. These features are likely produced by cosmic rays that have escaped Puppis A and are interacting with nearby dense molecular material. From this extended emission, we estimate the total energy in escaping cosmic rays to be $W_{CR} \sim 1.5 \times 10^{49}$ erg, providing important constraints on cosmic-ray propagation around the remnant.

 - **Abstract**
 The variation in hot Jupiter (HJ) occurrence across stellar environments holds clues as to the dominant formation channels of these extreme planets. Recent studies suggest HJ hosts preferentially reside in regions of high phase space density, possibly reflecting natal environmental conditions. These regions are kinematically cold (|v| < 40 km/s), prompting the alternative hypothesis that the correlation reflects an age bias: planetary systems in overdensities are systematically younger and therefore less likely to have undergone tidal inspiral and destruction. We test whether the apparent excess of HJs in phase space overdensities arises from differences in intrinsic host properties -- mass, metallicity, age -- which may correlate with phase space density or whether there is evidence for an additional environmental effect. We derive homogeneous estimates for the mass, metallicity, and age of planet-hosting stars using 2MASS and Gaia DR3 photometry, parallaxes, and self-consistent spectroscopic and spectrophotometric observables. In a sample of 2265 confirmed exoplanet hosts, we find a significant relative excess of HJs orbiting stars in overdense regions. However, we also find that overdensities preferentially host younger, more massive, and more metal-rich stars compared to underdensities. After correcting for these differences, either by detrending the phase space density against age or by matching host properties across subsamples, we find no significant differences in the HJ populations between over- and underdense regions. Our results suggest that the previously reported correlation between HJ occurrence and phase space density is driven by underlying differences in host star demographics rather than an intrinsic environmental effect.
#### Transition radiation in dusty novae with non-thermal radio emission

 - **Abstract**
 Transition radiation is produced when a relativistic charged particle enters or leaves a solid medium. The electrons that produce synchrotron radiation may interact with the dust in circumstellar environments, leading to the emission of transition radiation. We explore the production of transition radiation in dusty novae that also display synchrotron radiation emission. Transition radiation is emitted in the hard ultra-violet/X-ray range. We suggest that, even when the transition radiation is not itself directly observable, it may have a role in determining the ionisation balance of, and grain heating in, nova ejecta. Furthermore, it may be important in other dusty environments (such as supernova remnants) with non-thermal radio emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Light pollution is an increasing environmental concern, impacting both ecological systems and human health. This report presents an analysis of light pollution data from the \textit{Was het donker} SQM network from 2020 until 2023, with a focus on indirect light pollution, commonly known as skyglow. By integrating measurements from Sky Quality Meter (SQM) stations in the network and cloud cover data from EUMETSAT, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of night sky brightness across a region encompassing northern Netherlands and the western part of the German Wadden Coast. Yearly changes in brightness for 27 locations were ranked and plotted, revealing that in the darkest areas, light pollution is increasing at a rate of 2.78 to 6.68 percent per year. A trend emerged showing that brighter areas experienced lower variability in brightness, while darker zones exhibited higher variability. This is due to the dominance of artificial light sources, such as street lighting, in brighter areas, which reduces the influence of natural light sources like the Moon, stars, and cloud backscatter. Seasonal patterns and the effects of the Milky Way were also investigated. Density plots were employed to visualize these changes in night sky brightness, helping to identify specific sources of light pollution, such as greenhouse lighting and streetlight turn-off times. These findings emphasize the need for systematic monitoring of light pollution and offer valuable insights that can guide public awareness initiatives and inform light pollution mitigation strategies.

 - **Abstract**
 Witness reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) occasionally associate UAP sightings with local electromagnetic interferences, such as spinning magnetic compasses onboard aircraft or sudden malfunctions of mechanical vehicles. These reports have motivated the incorporation of a magnetometer into the instrumentation suite of the Galileo Project (GP), a Harvard-led scientific collaboration whose aim is to collect and analyze multi-sensor data that collectively could help elucidate the nature of UAP. The goal of the GP magnetometry investigation is to identify magnetic anomalies that cannot be readily explained in terms of a natural or human-made origin, and analyze these jointly with the data collected from the other modalities. These include an ensemble of visible and infrared cameras, a broadband acoustic system and a weather-monitoring system. Here, we present GP's first geomagnetic variometer station, deployed at the GP observatory in Colorado, USA. We describe the calibration and deployment of the instrumentation, which consists of a vector magnetometer and its data acquisition system, and the collection and processing of the data. Moreover, we present and discuss examples of the magnetic field data obtained over a period of 6 months, including data recorded during the May 2024 G5 extreme geomagnetic storm. We find that the data meet and even surpass the requirements laid out in GP's Science Traceability Matrix. Key to the evaluation of our data is the proximity of the variometer station to the USGS magnetic observatory in Boulder, Colorado. By comparing the two sets of data, we find that they are of similar quality. Having established the proper functioning of the first GP variometer station, we will use it as the model for variometer stations at future GP observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 We present CRPropa 3.3, the latest release of the publicly available Monte Carlo framework for simulating the propagation of high-energy particles in astrophysical environments. This version introduces significant extensions that enables multi-messenger studies across a broad energy range, from GeV to ZeV. New features include explicit time tracking, time-dependent advection fields, and support for position-dependent radiation backgrounds, for more realistic simulations of Galactic and extragalactic propagation. Nuclear cross sections have been updated and expanded up to lead (Z=82). We illustrate some of these new features, including acceleration at moving shocks and gamma-ray propagation in the interstellar radiation field. Together, these improvements establish CRPropa 3.3 as a comprehensive tool for modelling cosmic rays, gamma rays, and their secondaries in structured, time-dependent environments, setting the stage for next-generation multi-messenger astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been established that a significant fraction of star formation at high-redshift occurs in clumpy galaxies. The properties of clumps and their formation mechanisms, however, remain highly debated. In this work we analyze a sample of 18 Supercompact Ultraviolet Luminous Galaxies observed with the OSIRIS spectrograph at the Keck Telescope, targeting their Pa-alpha emission. These galaxies, although at z~0.1-0.2, share many similar properties with star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon. We find a total of 84 star-forming clumps with typical sizes of a few hundred parsecs. The star-forming clumps exhibit low values of velocity shear (~12 km/s) and high velocity dispersion (~70 km/s). The dynamical masses of the clumps are typically higher than gas masses inferred from the measured star-formation rates of each clump. We also artificially redshift our data to emulate observations at z=2.2 and allow for a direct comparison with other galaxies at higher redshift. Our results indicate that, due to the effects of clump clustering and low-resolution observations, high-z clumps appear larger at greater cosmological distances. This underscores the importance of using low-redshift observations to anchor studies at earlier epochs. Finally, our results support the idea of growing clump sizes in star-forming galaxies as a function of redshift, although not to scales of kpc as found by other works without the benefits of adaptive optics or gravitational lensing.

 - **Abstract**
 We present direct measurements of the intrinsic alignments (IA) of over 2 million spectroscopic galaxies using DESI Data Release 1 and imaging from four lensing surveys: DES, HSC, KiDS, and SDSS. In this uniquely data-rich regime, we take initial steps towards a more tailored IA modelling approach by building a library of IA measurements across colour, luminosity, stellar mass, and redshift. We map the dependence between galaxy type -- in terms of rest-frame colour, strength of the 4000 Angstrom break, and specific star formation rate -- and IA amplitude; the bluest galaxies have an alignment consistent with zero, across low (0.05<z<0.5) and high (0.8<z<1.55) redshifts. In order to construct cosmic shear samples that are minimally impacted by IA but maintain maximum sample size and statistical power, we map the dependence of alignment with colour purity. Red, quenched galaxies are strongly aligned and the amplitude of the signal increases with luminosity, which is tightly correlated with stellar mass in our catalogues. For DESI galaxies between 0<z<1.5, trends in luminosity and colour alone are sufficient to explain the alignments we measure -- with no need for an explicit redshift dependence. In a companion paper (Jeffrey et al., in prep), we perform detailed modelling of the IA signals with significant detections, including model comparison. Finally, to direct efforts for future IA measurements, we juxtapose the colour-magnitude-redshift coverage of existing IA measurements against modern and future lensing surveys.
