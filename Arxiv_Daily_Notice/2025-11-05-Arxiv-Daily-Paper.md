 - **Abstract**
 The study of binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in globular clusters (GCs) is a key ingredient to study binary and stellar evolution under extreme conditions. In this context, an accurate analysis of the optical emission, which is mostly dominated by the companion star, is essential for a comprehensive characterization of these systems and their role within their environment. In this work, we present a multi-wavelength investigation of five binary MSPs in the Galactic GC M3 (NGC 5272) using archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. Our analysis builds on the timing solutions obtained with the FAST radio Telescope by Li et al. (2024). For each MSP, we carry out precise astrometric cross-matching with the accurate radio positions to identify potential counterparts. When a match is found, we analyse its location in the colour-magnitude diagrams and compare the results with updated binary evolution models to infer the system properties. We confirm the identification of the optical companion to M3B, matching the source previously reported by Cadelano et al. (2019), and successfully identify and characterize the optical companions to M3D and M3F. All three are consistent with helium white dwarfs, as expected from the canonical formation scenario. For M3A and M3E, no reliable counterparts are found, but we place strong upper limits on the brightness and mass of the undetected companion. In the case of M3E, we detect a red object near the radio position in two F814W observations; however, astrometric measurements over a 15-year baseline reveal a significant proper motion inconsistent with cluster membership, identifying the source as a foreground contaminant. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining precise radio timing with deep, multi-band HST images to uncover and constrain the nature of MSP companions in GCs, offering insights into their formation and evolutionary histories.
#### Inferring the physics of protoplanetary disc evolution from the irradiated Cygnus OB2 region -- A comparison of viscous and MHD wind-driven scenarios

 - **Abstract**
 Our current understanding has crystallised around two possible evolution scenarios for protoplanetary discs (turbulent viscosity and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind-driven) - but which dominates remains uncertain. Our aims are twofold: Firstly, we investigate whether a single set of model parameters can reproduce the observational constraints of non-irradiated and irradiated discs. Secondly, we propose a novel approach to break degeneracies between the two evolution scenarios by studying the relation of stellar accretion rate and externally driven wind mass-loss rates, which evolve differently depending on the mechanism of angular momentum transport in the outer disc. We evolve synthetic populations of protoplanetary discs using 1D vertically integrated models for both viscous and MHD wind-driven disc evolution including both internal X-ray and external far ultraviolet (FUV) photoevaporation for both evolution scenarios. We investigate both weak and strong FUV field environments, where the strong FUV field is calculated based on an environment similar to the Cygnus OB2 association. While both scenarios are able to reproduce observational constraints, our simulations suggest that different parameters are needed for the angular momentum transport to explain disc lifetimes and disc mass - stellar accretion rate relation in weakly and strongly irradiated regions. We find that the predicted median disc radii are much larger in low FUV environments compared to Cygnus OB2, but also decreasing with time. In the viscous scenario, the median disc radius in a low FUV field environment is ~100au larger than for the MHD wind-driven scenario. We further show that studying stellar accretion rates and externally driven wind mass-loss rates (provided that they can be isolated from internally driven winds; i.e. MHD wind) is indeed a promising way of disentangling the two evolution scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 We present predictions for proper motions, infall times and times of first pericentric passage for 39 of M31's satellite galaxies. We estimate these by sampling satellite orbits from cosmological N-body simulations matched on mass, distance and velocity along the line of sight, in addition to properties of the host system. Our predictions are probabilistic based on repeated sampling from the uncertainty distributions of all quantities involved. We use these constraints on the satellites' orbital histories in conjunction with their published star formation histories to investigate the dominant environmental mechanisms for quenching satellites of M31-like hosts. Around half of the satellites appear to have quenched before their first pericentric passage around M31. Only the most massive satellites (with stellar masses > 10^8 M_sun) are able to maintain star formation for up to billions of years after infall. The majority of faint satellites, with stellar masses < 10^8 M_sun , were likely quenched before entering the M31 system. We compare our results for M31 against predictions for the Milky Way's satellites from the literature; M31's has a more active recent accretion history with more recently quenched satellites than the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate if systems of multiple Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) can serve as a proxy for dark matter halo mass, assess how their radiative properties relate to the underlying halo conditions, and explore the physics of star formation activity in LAEs and its relation to possible physically related companions. We use data from the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey, which targets LAEs in three narrow redshift slices. We identify physically associated LAE multiples in the COSMOS field at $z = 2.4$, $z = 3.1$, and $z=4.5$, and use a mock catalog from the IllustrisTNG100 simulation to assess the completeness and contamination affecting the resulting sample of LAE multiples. We then study their statistical and radiative properties as a function of multiplicity, where we adopt the term multiplicity to refer to the number of physically associated LAEs. We find a strong correlation between LAE multiplicity and host halo mass in the mocks, with higher multiplicity systems preferentially occupying more massive halos. In both ODIN and the mock sample, we find indications that the mean Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and UV magnitude of LAEs in multiples increase with multiplicity. The halo-wide LAE surface brightness densities in Ly$\alpha$ and UV increase with multiplicity, reflecting more compact and actively star-forming environments. The close agreement between the model and ODIN observations supports the validity of the Ly$\alpha$ emission model in capturing key physical processes in LAE environments. Finally, a subhalo-based perturbation induced star formation model reproduces the minimum subhalo mass distribution in simulations at $z=2.4$, suggesting that local perturbations, rather than the presence of LAE companions, drive star formation in these systems. For the higher redshifts, neighbor perturbations do not seem to be the main driver that triggers star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Keck Cosmic Web Imager observations of stellar populations in three galaxies at the centers of cooling flow clusters. All three host rich molecular gas reservoirs and show prominent Balmer absorption from $30-100$ Myr-old stars consistent with long lasting star formation. Two systems, A1835 and PKS 0745-191, have extended young stellar populations in their centers with recent star formation rates of 100 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and 8 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. In A1835 we uncover a massive blueshifted clump of young stars moving at high speed with respect to the gas and central galaxy. We suggest this feature is a young population that formed in a gaseous outflow that has detached from its natal gas and is falling back toward the galaxy. This result, combined with a companion study (arXiv:2404.02212) tracing nebular emission which presumably cooled from the hot X-ray atmosphere, indicates that star formation is proceeding in a dynamically complex environment resulting from the central galaxy's motion with respect to the cooling clouds and motion induced by feedback from the central radio jets. In RX J0820.9+0752 intermediate age stars are found in a filament outside of the nucleus with no discernible star formation at the center of the galaxy. All projected galaxies are composed of old stellar populations with deep D4000 breaks and are devoid of detectable warm gas. While in some instances they may be interacting gravitationally with the central galaxy, they cannot have donated the upward of $10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas found in these systems.
#### Bars in low-density environments rotate faster than bars in dense regions

 - **Abstract**
 Does the environment of a galaxy directly influence the kinematics of its bar? We present observational evidence that bars in high-density environments exhibit significantly slower rotation rates than bars in low-density environments. Galactic bars are central, extended structures composed of stars, dust and gas, present in approximately 30 to 70 per cent of luminous spiral galaxies in the local Universe. Recent simulation studies have suggested that the environment can influence the bar rotation rate, $R$, which is used to classify bars as either fast ($1\leq R \leq1.4$) or slow ($R \gt 1.4$). We use estimates of $R$ obtained with the Tremaine-Weinberg method applied to Integral Field Unit spectroscopy from MaNGA and CALIFA. After cross-matching these with the projected neighbour density, $\log\Sigma$, we retain 286 galaxies. The analysis reveals that bars in high-density environments are significantly slower (median $R = 1.67^{+0.72}_{-0.42}$) compared to bars in low-density environments (median $R = 1.37^{+0.51}_{-0.34}$); Anderson-Darling $\textit{p}$-value of $p_{\mathrm{AD}}= 0.002$ ($3.1\,\sigma$). This study marks the first empirical test of the hypothesis that fast bars are formed by global instabilities in isolated galaxies, while slow bars are triggered by tidal interactions in dense environments, in agreement with predictions from numerous $\textit{N}$-body simulations. Future studies would benefit from a larger sample of galaxies with reliable Integral Field Unit data, required to measure bar rotation rates. Specifically, more data are necessary to study the environmental influence on bar formation within dense settings (i.e. groups, clusters and filaments).

 - **Abstract**
 The destruction of Giant Molecular Clouds is a key component in galaxy evolution. We theoretically model the destruction of GMCs by HII regions, which evaporate ionized gas and eject neutral gas during their expansion. HII regions follow one of three tracks, depending on the EUV luminosity, $S$, of the ionizing OB association: the expansion can stall inside the cloud; it can break out, forming a blister (champagne) flow; or, for $S>S_{\rm com}$, it can result in the formation of a cometary cloud. We present results for the accumulated mass loss, $M_{\rm loss}(t)$, and the final mass loss, $M_{{\rm loss},f}$, by evaporation and ejection for a range of cloud masses ($10^4<M<10^{7}$ M$_\odot$), cloud surface densities ($50<\Sigma<1000$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$), OB association luminosities ($10^{44}<S<10^{52}$ s$^{-1}$), and off-center position of the association. We do not consider starbursts; our neglect of radiation pressure restricts our treatment to $S<10^{52} [(M/10^6$ M$_\odot)^{0.3})/(\Sigma /100$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$)] s$^{-1}$, and our neglect of gravity restricts $(M/10^6$ M$_\odot$)($\Sigma/ 100$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}) < 10$. We find that $M_{{\rm loss},f}$ for the range $0.1 < M_{{\rm loss},f}/M < 0.7$ , is proportional to $S^p$, where $p\sim 0.45-0.75$ depends on $M$, $\Sigma$, and association position. We find analytic fits to $S_{\rm com}$ as a function of $\Sigma$, $M$, and association position. $S> S_{\rm com}$ associations destroy at least 70% of the initial cloud. We find a critical cloud mass $M_{\rm survive}$ above which clouds never become cometary and lose $<$ 70% of their mass via a single association. Low mass clouds mostly lose mass via ejection of neutral gas.

 - **Abstract**
 In October 2024 JWST observed a transit of Kepler-167e, a Jupiter-analog planet on a 1000+ day orbit. These observations, recorded over a long baseline of nearly 60 hours, were designed to search for signatures of planetary oblateness and/or exomoons comparable to Ganymede. In this first in a series of studies analyzing these data we report on constraints on Kepler-167e's oblateness. We explored a large grid of data reduction pipelines and modeling choices, including a new entirely independent reduction pipeline ("katahdin") and two new treatments for limb darkening. We find that under a Bayesian model comparison framework the data are fit equally well by both spherical and oblate planet models, and that our ability to constrain the oblateness is negatively impacted by the influence of exposure-long trends. Using the most conservative of our posteriors, we place a 95% upper bound on the projected oblateness of $f<0.097$, which corresponds to a rotation period of $P\geq7.11$ hours if the planet's spin axis is aligned with the sky plane. We note, however, that the final bound depends on the choice of reduction pipeline and systematics model, and that our suite of end-to-end analyses produced bounds as low as $f<0.065$ at 95%. We conclude that leveraging JWST to make tighter constraints on planetary oblateness will require further investigation into mitigating exposure-long trends and correlated noise.

 - **Abstract**
 Since their discovery more than 60 years ago, accreting supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) were recognized as highly variable sources, requiring an extremely compact, dynamic environment. Their variability traces to multiple phenomena, including changing accretion rates, temperature changes, foreground absorbers, and structural changes to the accretion disk. Spurred by a new generation of time-domain surveys, the extremes of black hole variability are now being probed. We report the discovery of an extreme flare by the AGN J224554.84+374326.5, which brightened by more than a factor of 40 in 2018. The source has slowly faded since then. The total emitted UV/optical energy to date is $\sim10^{54}$ erg, i.e., the complete conversion of approximately one solar mass into electromagnetic radiation. This flare is 30 times more powerful than the previous most powerful AGN transient. Very few physical events in the Universe can liberate this much electromagnetic energy. We discuss potential mechanisms, including the tidal disruption of a high mass $(>30\, M_\odot)$ star, gravitational lensing of an AGN flare or supernova, or a supermassive (pair instability) supernova in the accretion disk of an AGN. We favor the tidal disruption of a massive star in a prograde orbit in an AGN disk.
#### Stellar Birth Radii in the LMC: Insights into Chemodynamics, Radial Migration, and Star Formation Across the Disk

 - **Abstract**
 The LMC and SMC are interacting dwarf galaxies that offer a valuable testbed for studying the effects of galactic mergers. We investigate the chemodynamic history of the LMC in the context of its interaction with the SMC by inferring stellar birth radii, first validated on a hydrodynamical simulation tailored to reproduce their interaction history. Using inferred birth radii and stellar ages, we identify signatures of dynamical and chemical evolution across the LMC disk. We find that the LMC's metallicity gradient steepened around 5, 3, and 1 Gyr ago, coinciding with enhanced star formation (SF) episodes. These events exhibit distinct spatial patterns -- initially concentrated in the inner disk at 5 Gyr, expanding outward by 3 Gyr, and becoming widespread with renewed central activity at 1 Gyr -- likely reflecting changes in spin alignment between the interacting disks if the enhancements of SF tracks the pericenter passages of the SMC to the LMC. The inferred radial migration strength of the LMC shows notable enhancements at 0.5, 2, and 5 Gyr. The most $\alpha$-enriched stars form 2-3 Gyr ago at birth radii of 2-4 kpc, the only epoch when star formation is broadly distributed across the disk. Finally, unlike the Milky Way, the LMC lacks a clear [$\alpha$/M]-[Fe/H] bimodality. This is likely due to its more centrally concentrated star formation during these periods, compared to the MW's more extended outer-disk star formation enhancements. These findings place strong constraints on the LMC's assembly history and its interaction with the SMC.
#### Weak-Lensing Analysis of the Galaxy Cluster Abell 85: Constraints on the Merger Scenarios of Its Southern Subcluster

 - **Abstract**
 Abell 85 is a nearby (z=0.055) galaxy cluster that hosts a sloshing cool core, a feature commonly reported in relaxed clusters. However, the presence of multiple past and ongoing mergers indicates that it is an active node within the Abell 85/87/89 complex. We present a weak gravitational lensing (WL) analysis using Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging data to understand its assembly history by investigating the dark matter components of the substructures. Our mass reconstruction resolves three substructures associated with the brightest cluster galaxy (main), the southern (S) subcluster, and the southwestern (SW) subcluster, with WL peak significances of $> 6\sigma$, $> 5\sigma$, and $> 4\sigma$, respectively. The locations of these mass peaks are consistent with those of the member galaxies. We estimate the masses of the main cluster ($M_{200c,main} = 2.91 \pm 0.72 \times 10^{14}\ M_\odot$) and the S subcluster ($M_{200c,S} = 1.23 \pm 0.52 \times 10^{14}\ M_\odot$) by fitting a multi-halo Navarro-Frenk-White profile. This $\sim$2:1 mass ratio indicates that the system is undergoing a major merger that is actively shaping the current dynamical state of Abell 85. Incorporating X-ray observations, we discuss the merger phase of the S subcluster and further examine the star-forming activity along the putative filament extending southeast of Abell 85.
#### Anisotropy ansatz for the Jeans equations: oblate galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 In the solution of the Jeans equations for axisymmetric galaxy models the ``$b$-ansatz" is often adopted to prescribe the relation between the vertical and radial components of the velocity dispersion tensor, and close the equations. However, $b$ affects the resulting azimuthal velocity fields quite indirectly, so that the analysis of the model kinematics is usually performed after numerically solving the Jeans equations, a time consuming approach. In a previous work we presented a general method to determine the main properties of the kinematical fields resulting in the $b$-ansatz framework before solving the Jeans equations; results were illustrated by means of disk galaxy models. In this paper we focus more specifically on realistic ellipsoidal galaxy models. It is found that how and where $b$ affects the galaxy kinematical fields is mainly dependent on the flattening of the stellar density distribution, moderately on the presence of a Dark Matter halo, and much less on the specific galaxy density profile. The main trends revealed by the numerical exploration, in particular the fact that more flattened systems can support larger $b$-anisotropy, are explained with the aid of simple ellipsoidal galaxy models, for which most of the analysis can be conducted analytically. The obtained results can be adopted as guidelines for model building and in the interpretation of observational data.
#### The nature of ASASSN-24fw's occultation: modelling the event as dimming by optically thick rings around a sub-stellar companion

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02581

 - **Abstract**
 ASASSN-24fw is a main-sequence F-type star that experienced a rapid and long-lasting dimming event beginning in late 2024 and continuing until mid 2025. Its pre-dimming spectral energy distribution shows a persistent infrared excess with a fractional luminosity of approximately 0.5 percent. We model this excess using a two-component blackbody fit and find dust components with temperatures of about 1070 K and 390 K. Archival light curves indicate that ASASSN-24fw was photometrically stable prior to the event, suggesting that the dimming is caused by an external occulting body rather than intrinsic stellar variability. The event lasted about 275 days and exhibits a distinctive flat-bottomed profile of nearly 200 days, unlike most long-duration occultation events reported in the last decade. We analyze the light curve and spectra obtained during dimming to study the properties of both the star and the occulting material. A parametric light-curve model reveals multiple ingress phases, consistent with variations in the density and structure of the obscuring material. A second transit model favors an occulting body consistent with a gas giant or brown dwarf with a minimum mass of about 3.4 Jupiter masses and surrounded by an extended circumplanetary disk or rings of radius roughly 0.17 au. Near-infrared spectra taken during dimming show enhanced infrared excess and spectral features consistent with a late-type companion, approximately M8. We also detect variable H-alpha emission, suggesting evolving gas and dust in the occulting structure. Imaging from LCOGT identifies a nearby object within 3 arcsec, likely a bound companion at a projected separation of about 3000 au. Systems like ASASSN-24fw appear rare, and continued follow-up will help constrain the nature of the occulting body and the circumstellar environment.
#### The effect of mass and morphology on the mass assembly of galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The pace at which galaxies grew into their current stellar masses and how this growth is regulated is still not fully understood, nor is the role that morphology plays in this process. We applied full spectral fitting techniques with pyPipe3D to the MaNGA sample to obtain its star formation and stellar mass histories and used these to investigate the mass assembly of galaxies by measuring how their specific star formation correlates to their stellar mass at different look-back times. We find that the correlation between these two parameters was shallower in the past. Galaxies used to have similar mass doubling times and the current negative correlation between the specific star formation and M* is primarily due to more massive galaxies 'dropping' off the main sequence earlier than less massive ones. Additionally, selecting the galaxies into bins based on their present-day morphology shows a segregation in specific star formation rate (sSFR) that is maintained even at high look-back times, showing that the factors that determine which morphology a galaxy ends up in are in place at very early times. Similarly, selecting them based on their current star formation status shows that, on average, currently retired galaxies used to have slightly a higher sSFR before the drop-off, whereas galaxies that have continued to form stars until today had a lower sSFR initially. We compare our results to a set of cosmic surveys, finding partial agreement in our results with several of them, though with significant offsets in redshift. Finally, we discuss how our results fit with certain theoretical models on galaxy evolution as well as cosmological simulations.
#### Solving the cooling flow problem with combined jet-wind AGN feedback

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback is widely viewed as the most promising solution to the long-standing cooling flow problem in galaxy clusters, yet previous models prescribe jet properties inconsistent with accretion physics. We perform high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cluster using the MACER framework, incorporating both jets and winds constrained by general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and observations. The combined feedback reproduces key observables--including cold gas mass, star formation rate, thermodynamic radial profiles, and black hole growth--while jet-only or wind-only models fail. The success arises from turbulence driven by jet-wind shear that enhances kinetic-to-thermal energy conversion, boosting heating efficiency by factors of three and six relative to wind-only and jet-only cases, respectively, yielding a self-consistent solution to cluster cooling flows.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Cesam2k20, the latest version of the hydrostatic stellar evolution code CESAM originally developed by P. Morel and collaborators. Over the last three decades, it has undergone many improvements and has been extensively tested against other stellar evolution codes before being selected to compute the first-generation grid of stellar models for the PLATO mission. Among all the developments made thus far, Cesam2k20 now implements state-of-the-art models for the transport of chemical elements and angular momentum. It was recently made publicly available with an ecosystem of other codes interfaced with it: 1D and 2D oscillation codes ADIPLS and ACOR, optimisation program OSM, and Python utility package pycesam. This paper recalls the numerical peculiarities of Cesam2k20, namely, the use of a collocation method where the structure variables are decomposed as piecewise polynomials projected on a B-spline basis. Here, we review the options available for modelling the different physical processes. In particular, we illustrate the improvements made in the transport of chemical elements and angular momentum with a series of standard and non-standard solar models.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the complicated processes that regulate star formation and cause a galaxy to become quiescent is key to our comprehension of galaxy evolution. We used nine well resolved star-forming z<1 galaxies from the UVCANDELS survey, where a total of 10 HST bands including UV follow up in UVIS/F275W allow us to reconstruct the star formation histories (SFHs) of regions across each galaxy. This approach provides a powerful tool to explore the spatio-temporal connection between star formation and galaxy evolution. The spatial and temporal profiles of stellar mass and star formation rate surface density were obtained from the SFHs of these regions. We measure scaling relations and projected radial profiles of regions within each galaxy at the time of observation and at 1 Gyr lookback time, noting possible trends in the evolution. By comparing the change in star formation over time we can infer the timing and location of star formation and see early signs of star formation shut off before quenching occurs. We compared the star formation rate density -- stellar mass density scaling relations for individual galaxies as they evolve from 1 Gyr lookback time. The correlation lines pivot around a log-stellar mass surface density of 7.25 [$M_\odot$ $kpc^{-2}$] may be evidence of a self-regulating process on these scales. Radial profiles of galaxy Log sSFR show an overall decrease over 1 Gyr, but five galaxies show a greater change in Log sSFR at the outskirts than the center indicating a possible early onset of quenching in these galaxies.
