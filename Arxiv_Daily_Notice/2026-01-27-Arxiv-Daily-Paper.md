 - **Abstract**
 How galaxies formed and evolved in the expanding Universe is the main science goal of Near-Field Cosmology research. Studies of the properties of galaxies' resolved stars open a widow on their ancient galactic components, probing star formation during epochs more than 10 billion years ago. Extragalactic Planetary Nebulae (xPNe) can help decipher the signatures of mergers and interactions persisting over many dynamical times by tracing elemental abundances coupled with their kinematics and spatial distributions. With new facilities, reaching higher angular resolution, area coverage and sensitivity, one can use xPNe to map Oxygen and Argon element abundances, in addition to their kinematics, to extend the Galactic Archeology investigation to the oldest stellar aggregates in our Local Universe.

 Aims. We aim to investigate the connection between star formation histories (SFHs) and the inner dark matter density profiles of simulated galaxies. In particular, we test whether the burstiness and temporal distribution of star formation influence the formation of cored versus cuspy dark matter profiles. Methods. We homogeneously analysed simulated galaxies from the NIHAO and FIRE-2 projects. For each galaxy, we derived dark matter density profiles and measured the logarithmic slope in the inner region of the dark matter halo (1-2% of R$_{\rm vir}$). To characterise star formation burstiness, we introduced a criterion based on comparing the star formation rate (SFR) averaged over two distinct timescales. We further quantified the duration of SFHs by computing $M_{\star, \rm post}$ / $M_{\star, \rm pre}$, the ratio of stellar mass formed after versus before the epoch of reionisation at redshift z $\sim$ 6.5. Results. Homogeneous analysis reveals that inner slope versus stellar-to-halo mass ratio trends for NIHAO and FIRE-2 galaxies are in much better agreement than reported in previous works. The burstiness and duration of the SFH explain the scatter in the inner slope versus stellar-to-halo mass ratio relation, revealing that galaxies with above average burstiness and more extended SFHs are more efficient at developing cored dark matter profiles. In contrast, galaxies with smoother SFHs and earlier stellar mass assembly tend to maintain cuspier dark matter profiles. We present an analytic expression that improves predictions for the inner slope using the parameter $M_{\star \rm,post}$ / $M_{\star \rm,pre}$, which reduces the mean squared error in both simulation suites relative to previous formulations based solely on the stellar-to-halo mass ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has observed nearly the entire sky, producing full-frame images (FFIs) every 30 min (Cycles 1$-$2), 10 min (Cycles 3$-$4), and now 200 s (Cycle 5+), over 27-day sectors. Light curves extracted from FFIs can be used to measure stellar rotation periods ($P_{\rm rot}$) in nearby open clusters, and are well-suited for studying low-mass stars ($\lesssim$1.2 M$_\odot$) younger than $\approx$1 Gyr, whose $P_{\rm rot}$ are generally still $\leq$15 days. A challenge to exploiting TESS data fully is its 21$''$ pixel size, which can cause strong signals from a source to contaminate the signals of nearby sources in the crowded environments found, e.g., in the more distant and/or richest clusters. We conducted a test with the young ($\approx$350 Myr old), moderately distant (470 pc), and rich open cluster NGC 3532 ($N_\star$ > 3000), which has an extensive $P_{\rm rot}$ catalog from ground-based photometry, to examine the reliability of $P_{\rm rot}$ obtained from TESS data. We recovered 69% of the literature periods from at least one of the three TESS cycles in which NGC 3532 was observed before any quality analysis. We then used all available TESS data for low-mass members of NGC 3532 and, applying a set of quality cuts that combined information from TESS and from Gaia, measured $P_{\rm rot}$ for 885 cluster stars, adding 706 new $P_{\rm rot}$ to the existing catalog. We conclude that, when considered with appropriate caution, TESS data for stars in crowded fields can yield reliable $P_{\rm rot}$ measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Ordinary matter-including particles such as protons and neutrons-accounts for only about one sixth of all matter in the Universe. The rest is dark matter, which does not emit or absorb light but plays a fundamental role in galaxy and structure evolution. Because it interacts only through gravity, one of the most direct probes is weak gravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by intervening mass. Here we present an extremely detailed, wide-area weak-lensing mass map, covering 0.77 deg x 0.70 deg, using high-resolution imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as part of the COSMOS-Web survey. By measuring the shapes of 129 galaxies per square arcminute-many independently in the F115W and F150W bands-we achieve an angular resolution of 1.00 +/- 0.01 arcmin. Our map has more than twice the resolution of earlier Hubble Space Telescope maps, revealing how dark and luminous matter co-evolve across filaments, clusters, and under-densities. It traces mass features out to z ~ 2, including the most distant structure at z ~ 1.1. The sensitivity to high-redshift lensing constrains galaxy environments at the peak of cosmic star formation and sets a high-resolution benchmark for testing theories about the nature of dark matter and the formation of large-scale cosmic structure

 - **Abstract**
 We present a rest-ultraviolet to infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of 63 heavily reddened quasars (HRQs) at redshifts z=0.7-2.7 and with dust extinctions E(B-V)=0.4-1.8. Our analysis demonstrates that SEDs with red optical and blue UV continua are very common in HRQs, with more than 82 per cent of the sample showing a UV-excess relative to the reddened quasar continuum. We model the SEDs by combining a reddened quasar and an unobscured scattered light component, though contributions from a star-forming host galaxy cannot be ruled out. The average scattering fraction is small (0.3 per cent). Higher scattering fractions are ruled out by the (i-K)=2.5 colour-cut used to select HRQs which pre-dates the discovery of the JWST "Little Red Dot" (LRD) population. Hence, LRDs generally have bluer UV continua. Nevertheless, four HRQs satisfy the LRD UV/optical continuum slope selections and are therefore massive, cosmic noon analogues of LRDs. Analysis of the near-infrared SEDs of HRQs reveals a deficit of hot dust relative to blue quasars, similar to what is observed in LRDs. This suggests HRQs trace a phase where strong AGN feedback processes eject dust from the inner torus. The UV scattering fraction of HRQs is weakly correlated with the amount of hot dust emission and anti-correlated with the line-of-sight extinction, E(B-V). This is consistent with the hot dust acting as the scattering medium, and the line-of-sight extinction being dominated by dust on interstellar medium scales in the host galaxy.
#### The optical photometric and spectroscopic periodicities of the cataclysmic variable SRGt 062340.2-265751

 - **Abstract**
 We report on optical spectroscopic and photometric follow-up observations of the eROSITA discovered transient SRGt 062340.2-265751 and show that it displays the characteristics of a nova-like cataclysmic variable (CV), with possible indications of being a magnetic system. We try to put better constraints on the classification of SRGt 062340.2-265751 using optical time-resolved spectroscopic and photometric observations to find any periodicities in the system. From these periodicities we can classify the CV sub-type that it belongs to. Spectroscopic observations revealed a very low amplitude, K $\sim$ 14 km s$^{-1}$, in the radial velocity of the H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ emission lines, suggesting that the system is likely observed at a low inclination angle. High-speed photometric observations revealed highly stochastic variability, characteristic of many magnetic cataclysmic variable systems. A probable 3.645 $\pm$ 0.006 hour orbital period was found by applying Lomb-Scargle period analysis to the H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ emission line radial velocities. A 24.905 $\pm$ 0.065 min period was found from photometric observations, which we associate with the white dwarf spin. However, it was also found that the photometry revealed multiple periodicities from night to night. TESS observations in three sectors did not reveal any of the periodicities found from ground-based observations, but did show a prominent period in only one sector, which might be attributed to a positive superhump period. These multiple periodicities as well as the HeII $\lambda$4686 and Bowen blend emission lines seen in the spectra indicate that SRGt 062340.2-265751 is likely a nova-like CV, and might belong to the VY Scl sub-type.

 - **Abstract**
 Scenarios such as the QCD axion with the Peccei-Quinn symmetry broken after inflation predict an enhanced matter power spectrum on sub-parsec scales. These theories lead to the formation of dense dark matter structures known as minihalos, which provide insights into early Universe dynamics and have implications for direct detection experiments. We examine the mass loss of minihalos during stellar encounters, building on previous studies that derived formulas for mass loss and performed N-body simulations. We propose a new formula for the mass loss that accounts for changes in the minihalo profile after disruption by a passing star. We also investigate the mass loss for multiple stellar encounters. We demonstrate that accurately assessing the mass loss in minihalos due to multiple stellar encounters necessitates considering the alterations in the minihalo's binding energy after each encounter, as overlooking this aspect results in a substantial underestimation of the mass loss. We further extend our analysis to the Galactic environment by more accurately incorporating multiple stellar encounters and dynamical relaxation timescales, simulating minihalo orbits in the Galactic potential. Our results show stellar interactions are more destructive than previously estimated, reducing minihalo mass retention at the solar system to ~30%, compared to earlier estimates of ~60%. This enhanced loss arises from cumulative energy injections when relaxation periods between stellar encounters are accounted for. The altered minihalo mass function implies a larger fraction of axion dark matter occupies inter-minihalo space, potentially increasing the local axion density and improving haloscope detection prospects. This thesis highlights the significance of detailed modeling of stellar disruptions in shaping the axion dark matter distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of an extremely metal-poor galaxy at a redshift of z = 3.654, identified through infrared spectroscopy using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This galaxy, CAPERS-39810, exhibits a metallicity of 12 + log(O/H) = $6.73\pm0.13$, indicative of its primitive chemical composition, resembling the early stages of galaxy formation in the Universe. We use JWST NIRSpec/MSA for spectroscopic analysis, complemented by photometric data from the COSMOS2025 catalog. Our analysis employs the R3 strong-line diagnostic method to estimate metallicity, due to the lack of auroral lines in the spectrum. The galaxy's emission lines, including Hb, [O III], Ha and He I, are clearly detected. The rest-frame equivalent widths of the strong hydrogen recombination lines are EW_0(Hb) = $184\pm48$ Åand EW_0(Ha) = $1144\pm48$ Å. Furthermore, we perform detailed spectral energy distribution modeling to derive a galaxy logarithmic stellar mass of $8.02^{+0.22}_{-0.34}$ $M_\odot$. This discovery adds to the growing body of evidence for the existence of very low-metallicity galaxies existed at cosmic noon of $z\approx3$, which are crucial for understanding the processes of chemical enrichment and star formation in young galaxies at the cosmic noon.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter (DM) halos in $\Lambda$ Cold DM cosmological simulations are triaxial. Most exhibit figure rotation. We study 40 isolated halos with stellar disks from the TNG50 simulation suite across $\sim 4$~Gyr to understand whether and how a triaxial halo's tumbling and orientation relative to the disk can drive warps. We measure a warp angle $\psi$ and find even our isolated disks are all at least slightly warped, with each galaxy's maximum $\psi > 1.8^{\circ}$. We perform a modified cross-correlation analysis between $\psi$ and the figure rotation pattern speed, as well as the misalignment between the disk spin axis and (a) the figure rotation axis, (b) the halo minor axis, and (c) the gas angular momentum axis. We use snapshots spanning a lookback time $t_{lb} ~4$ Gyr with 25 linearly-spaced lags from $ 0 - 2.33$ Gyr. We do not find evidence for a consistent lag between the onset of a warp and any of the aforementioned factors on the population level. However, we find significant correlations between individual time-series at various lags. These maximum correlation coefficients were significantly offset from random chance at the population level, suggesting that several of these factors do correlate with disk warping in specific situations. By examining four case studies whose maximum correlation coefficients were significantly higher than random chance, we establish clear qualitative relationships between these factors and warps. While a non-warped galaxy typically shows minimal halo tilt and figure rotation, warped galaxies can have strong/weak tilts and/or strong/weak figure rotation.

#### Tracing Galaxy Evolution in the Nearby Universe: The Role of Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 Using a sample of $\sim$126,000 late-type galaxies (LTGs) from SDSS, we analyzed stellar mass as a function of dynamical mass. Stellar masses were estimated using eight SPS models with constant IMFs, while dynamical masses were derived from seven formulations based on Newtonian dynamics and virial equilibrium, incorporating both stellar and gas velocity dispersions. We account for key factors affecting dynamical mass estimation, including inclination, colour, concentration, and Sérsic index. We find that the difference between dynamical and stellar mass ($\Delta \log \mathbf{M}$) ranges from nearly zero to $\sim$95% of the dynamical mass, depending on mass and redshift. $\Delta \log \mathbf{M}$ appears to decreases with increasing redshift, but exhibits a saddle-like shape at low mass and low redshift-especially in disk-dominated LTGs-transitioning into a steep, linear trend at higher masses and redshifts. In the high-mass regime, the behavior resembles that of early-type galaxies. Moreover, our results indicate that this evolution is not discrete but follows a continuous transition between morphological regimes. Dark matter within LTGs is at most equal to $\Delta \log \mathbf{M}$, depending on the impact of the IMF and SPS on stellar mass estimation. Although SPS-based stellar masses do not include the gas component, previous studies have shown that galaxies with log($\mathbf{M_{Stellar}/M_{Solar}}) > 10$ at $z \leq 0.3$ are predominantly stellar-mass dominated. Most galaxies in our sample fall within this regime, minimizing the impact of gas exclusion. Our findings go beyond the scope of single galaxies, providing insight into the nearby Universe and highlighting the influence of dark matter in determining the Universe's structure and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons from three massive ($\text{M}_{*}>10^{10}\:\text{M}_{\odot}$) spiral galaxies at a redshift of nearly 1 in the AstroSat UV Deep Field South. Notably, all three systems are viewed at low inclination (i.e., nearly face-on), prompting an investigation into the role of galaxy orientation in the detectability of LyC emission from disk systems. Two of the three galaxies, however, host active galactic nuclei (AGNs), adding complexity to the interpretation of the LyC signal. We present a detailed analysis of the likely star-forming case, and report tentative evidence that a face-on viewing angle may enhance the likelihood of LyC detection in disk galaxies. This represents the first detection of LyC emission from well-characterized spiral galaxies at high redshift, offering a new window into LyC escape mechanisms in such systems. Our findings highlight the need to consider geometric factors and anisotropic escape pathways facilitated by feedback processes alongside more traditional density-bounded scenarios that imply isotropic escape.

 - **Abstract**
 The energy released by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is considered to have a profound impact on the cold gas properties of their host galaxies, potentially heating or removing the gas and further suppressing star formation. To understand the feedback from AGN radio activity, we investigate its impacts on the cold gas reservoirs in AGNs with different radio activity levels. We construct a quasar sample with a mean $z\sim1.5$ and a mean $L_{\rm bol}\sim10^{45.8}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$, all with Herschel detections to enable estimates of the total gas mass through the galactic dust continuum emission. The sample is then cross-matched with radio catalogs and divided into radio loud (RL) quasars, radio-detected radio quiet (RQ) quasars and radio-undetected quasars based on their radio loudness. Through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we find the radio-detected RQ quasars exhibit evidence of gas deficiency with host galaxies possessing $\sim 0.3$ dex lower dust and gas masses compared to the other two groups, despite being matched in $M_{\rm BH}$, $L_{\rm bol}$, $M_{*}$ and SFR. Furthermore, evidence from optical spectra shows that both the fraction and velocity of outflows are higher in the radio-detected RQ group, suggesting a connection between the ionized gas outflows and the moderate radio activity. These results suggest that the AGN feedback could be more efficient in AGNs with weak/moderate radio emission than in those without radio detection or those with strong radio emission. Further high-resolution observations are needed to understand the interaction between the interstellar medium and the weak/moderate AGN radio activity.

 - **Abstract**
 The rotational properties of asteroids provide critical information about not only their internal structure but also their collisional and thermal histories. Previous work has revealed a bimodal distribution of asteroid spin rates, dividing populations into fast and slow rotators, but to date this separation remains poorly understood (e.g. its dependency on composition). We investigate whether the valley separating fast and slow rotators in rotational period-diameter space depends on the composition of the asteroid, approximated by asteroids' spectral class. First, we extended the Minor Planet Physical Properties Catalogue (MP3C) to include the available spectral classes of asteroids. Then, for each asteroid we selected the best diameter, rotational period, and spectral class. Building upon a semi-supervised machine-learning method, we quantify the valley between fast and slow rotators for S- and C-complex asteroids, which are linked to ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites respectively. The method iteratively fits a linear boundary between the two populations in rotational period-diameter space to maximise their separation. We find a clear compositional dependence of the valley: for C-complex asteroids the transition occurs at longer periods than for S-complex, with P* = 14.4 D_km^0.739 (C-complex) and P* = 11.6 D_km^0.718 (S-complex), where period and diameter are given in hours and kilometres respectively. This corresponds to mu Q approximately 2 and 13 GPa, respectively, where mu is the rigidity and Q the quality factor. The dependence of the valley on spectral classes likely reflects compositional and structural differences: C-complex asteroids, being more porous and weaker, dissipate angular momentum more efficiently than stronger, more coherent S-complex asteroids. This represents quantitative evidence of class-dependent rotational valleys within asteroid populations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a JWST/NIRSpec rest-frame optical spectroscopic census of ALMA 1-mm continuum sources in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) identified by the deep ALMA UDF and ASPECS programs. Our sample is composed of the ALMA flux-limited ($S_{1\,\mathrm{mm}}\gtrsim 0.1\,\mathrm{mJy}$) sources observed with medium-resolution NIRSpec spectroscopy from JADES and SMILES, 16 faint submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at spectroscopic redshifts of $z\sim 1$-$4$. These SMGs show bright longer-wavelength optical lines (H$\alpha$, [N II]$\lambda\lambda6548,6583$, and [S II]$\lambda\lambda6717,6731$) and faint shorter-wavelength optical lines (H$\beta$ and [O III]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$) with a large nebular attenuation, $E(B-V)\sim0.3$-$1.8$. We test the SMGs using BPT diagnostics and Chandra X-ray fluxes, and find that most SMGs are classified as AGNs; the AGN fraction is $\sim80\%$ for the SMGs at $M_*>10^{10.5} M_\odot$. We find only one SMG ($<10\%$) with a broad Balmer line, indicating that the SMGs are predominantly obscured AGNs. With the optical lines, we estimate the metallicities of the SMGs to be moderately high, $\sim0.4$-$2 Z_\odot$, exceeding the model-predicted dust-growth critical metallicity ($\sim0.1$-$0.2Z_\odot$), which naturally explains the dusty nature of the SMGs. Interestingly, the SMGs fall in the mass-metallicity relation and the star-formation main sequence, showing no significant differences from other high-$z$ galaxies. Similarly, we find electron densities of $n_e\sim10^2$-$10^3\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ for the SMGs that are comparable with other high-$z$ galaxies. Together with the high SMG fraction ($\sim 100\%$) at the massive end ($M_*>10^{10.5} M_\odot$), these results indicate that the SMGs are mostly not special, but typical massive star-forming galaxies at high redshift.
#### In-depth analysis of bar formation mechanisms of disk galaxies in halos of different concentrations

 - **Abstract**
 We use $N$-body simulations to investigate the distinct bar formation processes in disks residing in halos of various concentrations. In a highly concentrated halo, the bar development is limited by the dominant multi-arm modes as a result of the swing amplification in the early stage. Only after the multi-arm modes decay, the bar growth proceeds mechanically owing to the particle trapping in continuation of that bar seed. In this scheme, the corotation resonance of the bar modes does not come into play at all, justified by a low amount of disk-halo angular momentum transfer and a modestly decreasing bar pattern speed. On the other hand, although reducing the halo concentration suggests the reduction of the preferred swing-amplified modes to be bi-symmetric, the bar formation in a lowly concentrated halo does not involve the swing amplification at all. Rather, the fast-growing linearly unstable bar modes of a single uniform frequency is solely the governing factor, attributed to a mild shearing. The bar modes trigger the corotation resonance since the beginning and such resonance is maintained until the end, which leads to a high amount of angular momentum transfer and a fast slowdown. For the intermediate halo concentration, the kinematical analyses of multiple non-axisymmetric modes suggests that the linear modes, the swing amplification, and the particle trapping are all present in the evolution chronology. To specify bars formed in the different halo concentrations, full analyses of the isophotal shape, the radial Fourier amplitude, and the resonance diagram can be of use.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical evolution of pre-stellar cores during their transition to a protostellar stage is not yet fully understood. Detailed chemical characterizations of these sources are needed to better define their chemistry during star formation. Our goal is to characterize the chemistry of the starless cores C2 and C16 in the B213/L1495 filament of the Taurus Molecular Cloud, and to understand how it relates to the environmental conditions and the evolutionary state of the cores. We made use of two complete spectral surveys at 7 mm of these sources, carried out using the Yebes 40-m telescope. Derived molecular abundances were compared with those of other sources in different evolutionary stages and with values computed by chemical models. Including isotopologs, 22 molecules were detected in B213-C2, and 25 in B213-C16. The derived rotational temperatures have values of between $\sim$ 5 K and $\sim$ 9 K. A comparison of the two sources shows lower abundances in C2, except for l-C$_{3}$H and HOCO$^{+}$, which have similar values in both cores. Model results indicate that both cores are best fit assuming early-time chemistry, and point to C2 being in a more advanced evolutionary stage, as it presents a higher molecular hydrogen density and sulfur depletion, and a lower cosmic-ray ionization rate. Our chemical modeling successfully accounts for the abundances of most molecules, including complex organic molecules and long cyanopolynes (HC$_{5}$N, HC$_{7}$N), but fails to reproduce those of the carbon chains CCS and C$_{3}$O. Chemical differences between C2 and C16 could stem from the evolutionary stage of the cores, with C2 being closer to the pre-stellar phase. Both cores are better fit assuming early-time chemistry of t $\sim$ 0.1 Myr. The more intense UV radiation in the northern region of B213 could account for the high abundances of l-C$_{3}$H and HOCO$^{+}$ in C2.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the role of resolution and initial magnetic field strength on core-collapse supernovae in simulations of a non-rotating $13 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ progenitor. Specifically, we study the effect on shock revival, explosion dynamics, and the properties of the compact remnant. We run four models with different numerical grid resolutions with an initial central dipole field strength of $\mathord{\approx}10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$. Two of those resolutions are also run with a weaker central magnetic field of $\mathord{\approx}10^{10}\, \mathrm{G}$ . The shock revival time for all models is largely independent of resolution and initial magnetic field strength, but we find higher explosion energies when the initial magnetism is stronger and at higher resolutions. We find that models with strong magnetic fields have lower neutrino luminosity and energies, due to a proto-neutron star (PNS) that is deformed by the strong magnetic fields. At higher resolutions, magnetic fields are amplified more efficiently in the gain region and in the PNS via the small-scale dynamo. Although the strong magnetic fields do not directly drive the explosion, they have a subsidiary impact on the explosion mechanism and compensate for the reduced neutrino heating. Stronger magnetic energies in the PNS also affect energy and angular momentum redistribution, leading to more extended and vigorous PNS convection zones at higher resolutions.

 - **Abstract**
 Velocity fields in the cosmic web are fundamental to structure formation but remain difficult to observe directly beyond the linear regime. Here we present observational evidence that galaxy filaments connecting pairs of galaxy clusters undergo a split infall, with opposite velocity flows toward the two clusters. Using spectroscopic galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we isolate the internal filament velocity field by subtracting its rigid-body background motion and Hubble flow, and detect this effect at greater than $5\sigma$ significance across a wide range of cluster and filament selections. The measured velocity profile exhibits a sign reversal near the filament midpoint and a maximum infall amplitude of $\sim30$ km/s ($\sim20$ km/s projected onto the line-of-sight) for clusters of mass $\sim10^{14.3}M_\odot$, substantially lower than expected for infall from an average cosmic environment. Multiple results on density-velocity correlation, mass-dependency, and validation with simulation indicate that filaments dynamically respond to competing gravitational potentials rather than acting as passive mass transport channels. Our results establish a new observational window on quasi-linear velocity fields in the cosmic web and provide a promising probe of mass measurement, testing gravity and velocity reconstruction with upcoming wide-field spectroscopic surveys.
#### Galactic Large-scale Filaments Resident in Asymmetric Environments: Clues from Cross-filament Profiles of Density and Temperature

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale filaments ubiquitously exist in the Galactic interstellar medium, and their radial profiles offer insights into their formation mechanisms. We present a statistical analysis of molecular hydrogen column density ($\rm N(H_2)$) and dust temperature ($\rm T_d$) radial profiles for 35 Galactic large-scale filaments. We divided their spines into 315 segments, extracted the radial profiles of each segment using $\rm N(H_2)$ and $\rm T_d$ maps derived from $Herschel$ Hi-GAL data, and estimated the asymmetry degree within the radial profiles ($\alpha_{\rm asy}$), as well as the length proportion of segments with asymmetric profiles across the entire filament ($f_{\rm asy}$). We found that Galactic large-scale filaments reside in surroundings distinctly asymmetric and varied in $\rm N(H_2)$, and mild asymmetric yet stable in $\rm T_d$. Different filament morphology types do not show significant differences in $\alpha_{\rm asy}$ or $f_{\rm asy}$. A bent filament shape does not necessarily correspond to an asymmetric radial profile, whereas a straight filament shape may be associated with a symmetric profile. Segments with asymmetric surroundings in $\rm N(H_2)$ may not simultaneously appear asymmetric in $\rm T_d$, and vice versa. We found three filaments with 4-44% of their spine show asymmetric $\rm N(H_2)$ and $\rm T_d$ radial profiles in inverse trends, likely caused by nearby HII region. HII regions of similar scale to large filaments can induce asymmetric radial profiles within them, indicating their influence on filament evolution. However, they are unlikely to independently trigger the formation of an entire Galactic large-scale filament, in contrast to their role in small-scale filament formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The assembly history of the Galactic bulge is intimately tied to the formation of the proto-Milky Way, yet reconstructing this early phase is difficult because mergers and secular evolution have erased most of its original structure. Among present-day stellar systems, only globular clusters retain the ancient signatures needed to trace these primordial building blocks. Here we present the most detailed characterization to date of Tonantzintla 2, a prime candidate for a relic of the Milky Way's primordial bulge. It is a moderately metal-rich globular cluster projected onto the bulge that has remained largely unexplored despite its potential to constrain the early formation of the inner Milky Way. We derive its fundamental parameters using proper motion-corrected Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 and ACS photometry. By applying an isochrone fitting to very clean data, we obtain an age of 13.58 Gyr, a reddening E(B-V) = 1.44, a metallicity [M/H]=-0.68, and a heliocentric distance of d = 7.38 kpc. A complementary chemical-abundance analysis of seven member stars from APOGEE high-resolution spectroscopy reveals an enrichment pattern consistent with an in-situ origin. Tonantzintla 2 is among the oldest globular clusters studied in the literature, and the oldest so far analyzed in the Galactic bulge. Its age places a stringent constraint on the onset of the bulge formation, implying that star formation in the inner Galaxy began within ~0.2 Gyr of the Big Bang and that Tonantzintla 2 represents an exceptional relic of the Milky Way's earliest chemical enrichment.

 - **Abstract**
 With the operation of JWST, atmospheric characterization has now extended to low-mass exoplanets. In compact multiplanetary systems, secular spin-orbital resonance may preserve high obliquities and asynchronous rotation even for tidally-despinning, low-mass planets, potentially leading to unique atmospheric circulation patterns. To understand the impact on the atmospheric circulation and to identify the potential atmospheric observational signatures of such high-obliquity planets, we simulate the three dimensional circulation of a representative mini-Neptune K2-290 b, whose obliquity may reach about 67 degrees. Whether synchronously rotating or not, the planet's slow rotation, moderate temperature and radius result in a global Weak-Temperature-Gradient (WTG) behavior with moderate horizontal temperature contrasts. Under synchronous rotation, broad eastward superrotating jets efficiently redistribute heat. Circulation in an asynchronous rotation exhibits a seasonal cycle driven by high obliquity, along with quasi-periodic oscillations in winds and temperatures with a period of about 70 orbital periods. These oscillations, driven by wave-mean flow interactions, extend from low to mid-latitudes due to the slow planetary rotation. Higher atmospheric metallicity strengthens radiative forcing, increasing temperature contrasts and jet speeds. Clouds have minimal impact under synchronous rotation but weaken jets under nonsynchronous rotation by reducing temperature contrasts. In all cases, both thermal emission and transmission spectra exhibit moderate observational signals at a level of 100 ppm, and high-obliquity effects contribute differences at the 10 ppm level. Our results are also applicable to a range of potential high-obliquity exoplanets, which reside in the WTG regime and likely exhibit nearly homogeneous horizontal temperature patterns.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes are the simplest possible objects, characterised by only mass and spin. We see them via accretion, so there is one more fundamental parameter which is the mass accretion rate. Here I will review how the data from both stellar and supermassive black holes can be fit into a framework where there is a major spectral transition at $\dot{m}=L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$ where the optically thick disc is replaced by a hot flow. This dramatic spectral change also affects the expected properties of thermal and radiatively powered winds, matching the overall properties of winds seen in new XRISM data from the stellar mass binaries, though there can also be additional UV and dust driven winds in supermassive black holes. The radio data in stellar and supermassive black holes are clear that the hot flow (not the disc) connects to the radio jet, and the radio-X-ray 'fundamental plane' can be qualitatively understood if the radio quiet AGN and stellar mass black holes have low to moderate spins, with the jet power set as a constant fraction of the accretion power. A small fraction of AGN (radio loud) instead have much higher (factor $100-1000\times$) radio-to-X-ray ratio at the same black hole mass and mass accretion rates. I speculate that these have higher jet power due to high black hole spin. I review the multiple issues still remaining in this picture, most of which are connected to the geometry and nature of the X-ray corona, and the conflicting constraints on this which come from reflection spectroscopy and polarimetry.
#### Constraining Reionization Morphology and Source Properties with 21cm-Galaxy Cross-Correlation Surveys

 - **Abstract**
 Cross-correlations between 21cm observations and galaxy surveys provide a powerful probe of reionization by reducing foreground sensitivity while linking ionization morphology to galaxies. We quantify the constraining power of 21cm-Galaxy cross-power spectra for inferring neutral hydrogen fraction $x_\mathrm{HI}(z)$ and mean overdensity $\langle 1+\delta_\mathrm{HI} \rangle(z)$, exploring dependence on field of view, redshift precision $\sigma_z$, and minimum halo mass $M_\mathrm{h,min}$. We employ our simulation-based inference framework EoRFlow for likelihood-free parameter estimation. Mock observations include thermal noise for 100h SKA-Low with foreground avoidance and realistic galaxy survey effects. For a fiducial survey ($\mathrm{FOV}=100\,\mathrm{deg}^2$, $\sigma_z=0.001$, $M_\mathrm{h,min}=10^{11}\mathrm{M}_\odot$), cross-power spectra yield unbiased constraints with posterior volumes (PV) of $\sim$10% relative to priors. Cross-power measurements reduce PV by 20-30% versus 21cm auto-power alone. With foreground avoidance, spectroscopic redshift precision is essential; photometric redshifts render cross-correlations uninformative. Notably, cross-power spectra constrain ionizing source properties, the escape fraction $f_\mathrm{esc}$ and star formation efficiency $f_*$, which remain degenerate in auto-power (PV $>$60%). Tight constraints require either deep surveys detecting faint galaxies ($M_\mathrm{h,min} \sim 10^{10}\mathrm{M}_\odot$) with moderate foregrounds, or conservative mass limits with optimistic foreground removal (PV $<$15%). 21cm-Galaxy cross-correlations enhance morphology constraints beyond auto-power while enabling previously inaccessible source property constraints. Realizing full potential requires precise redshifts and either faint galaxy detection limits or improved 21cm foreground cleaning.

 - **Abstract**
 Methanol (CH$_{3}$OH) is a key complex organic molecule (COM) in the interstellar medium, widely used as a tracer of dense gas and hot molecular cores (HMCs). Using high-resolution ALMA observations from the ATOMS survey, we investigate the excitation and abundance of methanol nuclear spin isomers and their relationship to chemical complexity in massive star-forming cores. We identify 20 methanol transitions, including A- and E-type lines in the v=0 state and E-type lines in the v$_{t}$=1 state, and detect 94 HMC candidates. Rotational temperature analysis under the LTE assumption yields average values of 194 $\pm$ 33 K for CH$_{3}$OH-E v$_{t}$=1, 178 $\pm$ 33 K for CH$_{3}$OH-A v=0, and 75 $\pm$ 33K for CH$_{3}$OH-E v=0. Emission from COMs other than methanol is detected in 87 of the 94 cores, with the CH$_{3}$OH-E v$_{t}$=1 line intensity showing a strong correlation with the channel detection ratio (CDR). These results demonstrate that CH$_{3}$OH-E v$_{t}$=1 lines are reliable tracers of HMCs and chemical complexity, and that the CDR provides a robust indicator of molecular richness. The temperature difference between A- and E-type methanol transitions is driven by anomalously strong J(2,J-2)$-$J(-1,J-1) lines, highlighting the importance of analyzing methanol symmetry types separately.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how the orbital evolution and mass distribution of infalling satellite galaxies shape the phase-space and radial distributions of intracluster light (ICL) relative to the underlying cluster dark matter (DM) halo. Using N-body simulations, we follow the tidal stripping and orbital evolution of satellite galaxies as they are accreted into a live cluster halo, systematically varying satellite-to-host mass ratio and orbital circularity. We measure the specific orbital energy and angular momentum of stripped stellar and DM material, finding that the stripped stars consistently occupy lower-energy and lower-angular momentum regions of phase-space than the stripped DM. The magnitude of this difference increases strongly towards more equal satellite--to--host mass ratios, while the dependence on orbital circularity is weak. We construct a predictive model for the phase-space properties of stripped stars and DM from a whole infalling satellite population and find that the resulting phase-space difference between the components are driven primarily by the characteristic mass of the infalling satellite stellar mass function. We find that the ICL is always more centrally concentrated than the DM. The magnitude of this offset depends on the characteristic mass and increases towards higher characteristic masses. Comparisons with four independent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations show that, once the infalling satellite stellar mass function is matched, the model reproduces the radial stellar-to-DM density profile offsets to better than the inter-simulation scatter. This demonstrates that the radial relationship between the ICL and the DM distribution is largely governed by satellite demographics. With adequate constraints on the infalling satellite population, ICL density profiles can therefore be used as informative tracers of the underlying radial DM distribution in clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that Schwarzschild primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the radiation-dominated era can grow extremely rapidly through $\textit{radiative absorption}$ governed by the full Stefan-Boltzmann law. By introducing a principle of isonomy - ensuring identical particle species dependence for Hawking emission and absorption - we find that, whenever the temperature of the PBH environment is larger than the PBH horizon temperature, PBHs generically gain mass. In particular, for PBH masses following the critical collapse mass-scaling law with critical exponent $\gamma_\mathrm{crit}$, with $\gamma_\mathrm{crit} \in (0.33, 0.49)$, the aforementioned radiative absorption mass growth mechanism produces a striking effect: PBHs forming with a mass $10^6M_\odot$ during BBN can reach $\mathcal{O}(10^{10} M_\odot)$ within $\mathcal{O}(10^{6} \mathrm{s})$ ($\sim $ 58 days). Interestingly enough, small deviations from $\gamma_\mathrm{crit}$, depending itself on the number of relativistic species present in the primordial plasma, yield a continuous PBH mass spectrum providing us ultimately with a single, Standard-Model-based explanation for the origin of stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black holes (SMBHs), and naturally accounting for the early appearance of SMBHs. The Schwarzschild treatment presented here can be extended to spherically symmetric cosmological black holes, indicating that radiative absorption is a dominant and previously overlooked PBH growth channel in the early Universe.
#### Explaining the thermal emission of old neutron stars with rotochemical heating and magnetized superconducting protons

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of likely thermal ultraviolet emission from a few old neutron stars suggests that at least one internal heating mechanism is present in these stars. One proposed mechanism is rotochemical heating, in which the continuous contraction of the neutron star due to its spin-down produces chemical imbalances that induce Urca reactions, and the latter deposit heat in the neutron star core. If the protons in the star are superconducting, their energy gap suppresses the reactions, except in microscopic magnetized regions (such as quantized flux tubes) in which the protons act as if they were normal. Therefore, the strength of the internal magnetic field controls the rate at which reactions proceed and thus affects the thermal evolution of the neutron star. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of the effect of an internal magnetic field in the superconducting interior on rotochemical heating. We simulate the evolution of neutron stars for different internal magnetic field strengths and neutron energy gaps, comparing the results to Hubble Space Telescope observations of old neutron stars. All the observational data can be accounted for if the proton energy gap is large ($\sim 1.5\,\mathrm{MeV}$) and the neutron energy gap is small ($\lesssim 0.1\,\mathrm{MeV}$) or vanishing, while the millisecond pulsar PSR~J0437$-$4715 needs to have a very weak internal magnetic field. Our results suggest that neutron-star cores are characterized by a large proton pairing gap and a small or vanishing neutron gap, and that millisecond pulsars have very weak internal magnetic fields. Under these conditions, rotochemical heating alone can account for the observed thermal emission of old neutron stars.

 - **Abstract**
 It is still not clear which environmental processes operate in filaments. Given the ubiquity of filaments and their importance in feeding clusters, a proper understanding of these mechanisms is crucial to a more complete picture of galaxy evolution. To investigate them, we need large galaxy samples with resolved imaging. For this study, we analyse resolved H$\alpha$ maps of 685 galaxies inside and outside the filaments around the Virgo cluster in addition to extensive measurements of integrated physical properties. We create a pipeline to decompose the H$\alpha$ images into individual clumps. We find that the number and average size of clumps in a galaxy are well-defined functions of distance and angular resolution. In particular, the power-law relation between the number of clumps and the distance of a galaxy is consistent with a fractal structure of star forming regions. We formulate an algorithm to compare filament and non-filament galaxies after removing observational differences. Although we do not have any conclusive evidence for a difference in clump size distributions between filament and non-filament galaxies, we do find that filament galaxies have slightly more peripheral clumps than their non-filament counterparts.
