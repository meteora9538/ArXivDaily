#### Spinning into the Gap: Direct-Horizon Collapse as the Origin of GW231123 from End-to-End GRMHD Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123, the most massive binary black hole (BH) merger observed to date, involves component BHs with masses inside the pair-instability mass gap and unusually high spins. This challenges standard formation channels such as classical stellar evolution and hierarchical mergers. However, stellar rotation and magnetic fields, which have not been systematically incorporated in prior models, can strongly influence the BH properties. We present the first self-consistent simulations tracking a massive, low-metallicity helium star from helium core burning through collapse, BH formation, and post-BH formation accretion using 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. Starting from a $250\,M_\odot$ helium core, we show that collapse above the pair-instability mass gap, aided by rotation and magnetic fields, drives mass loss through disk winds and jet launching. This enables the formation of highly spinning BHs within the mass gap and reveals a BH spin-mass correlation. Strong magnetic fields extract angular momentum from the BH through magnetically driven outflows, which in turn suppress accretion, resulting in slowly spinning BHs within the mass gap. In contrast, stars with weak fields permit nearly complete collapse and spin-up of the BH to $ a\approx1$. We show that massive low-metallicity stars with moderate magnetic fields naturally produce BHs whose masses and spins match those inferred for GW231123, and are also consistent with those of GW190521. The outflows may impart a BH kick, which can induce spin-orbit misalignment and widen the post-collapse orbit, delaying the merger. The outflows launched during collapse may power short-lived, high-luminosity jets comparable to the most energetic $\gamma$-ray bursts, offering a potential observational signature of such events in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars are born in a variety of environments that determine how they gather gas to achieve their final masses. It is generally believed that disks are ubiquitous around protostars as a result of angular momentum conservation and are natural places to grow planets. As such, they are proposed to be the last link in the inflow chain from the molecular cloud to the star. However, disks are not the only form that inflows can take. Here we report on high-resolution observations performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array that reveal inflows in the form of streamers. These streamers persist well within the expected disk radius, indicating that they play a substitute role channeling material from the envelope directly to an unresolved small disk or even directly to the forming high-mass protostar. These flows are massive enough to feed the central unresolved region at a rate sufficient to quench the feedback effects of the young massive star.
#### CIGaRS I: Combined simulation-based inference from SNae Ia and host photometry

 - **Abstract**
 Using type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia) as cosmological probes requires empirical corrections, which correlate with their host environment. We present a unified Bayesian hierarchical model designed to infer, from purely photometric observations, the intrinsic dependence of SN Ia brightness on progenitor properties (metallicity & age), the delay-time distribution (DTD) that governs their rate as a function of age, and cosmology, as well as the redshifts of all hosts. The model incorporates physics-based prescriptions for star formation and chemical evolution from Prospector-beta, dust extinction of both galaxy and SN light, and observational selection effects. We show with simulations that intrinsic dependences on metallicity and age have distinct observational signatures, with metallicity mimicking the well-known step of SN Ia magnitudes across a host stellar mass of $\approx 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We then demonstrate neural simulation-based inference of all model parameters from mock observations of ~16 000 SNae Ia and their hosts up to redshift 0.9. Our joint physics-based approach delivers robust and precise photometric redshifts (<0.01 median scatter) and improved cosmological constraints, unlocking the full power of photometric data and paving the way for an end-to-end simulation-based analysis pipeline in the LSST era.

 - **Abstract**
 CO isotopologues are common tracers of the bulk molecular gas in extragalactic studies, providing insights into the physical and chemical conditions of the cold molecular gas, a reservoir for star formation. Since star formation occurs within molecular clouds, mapping CO isotopologues at cloud-scale is important to understanding the processes driving star formation. However, achieving this mapping at such scales is challenging and time-intensive. The Surveying the Whirlpool Galaxy at Arcseconds with NOEMA (SWAN) survey addresses this by using the Institut de radioastronomie millimétrique (IRAM) NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) to map the $^{13}$CO(1-0) and C$^{18}$O(1-0) isotopologues, alongside several dense gas tracers, in the nearby star-forming galaxy M51 at high sensitivity and spatial resolution ($\approx$ 125 pc).We examine the $^{13}$CO(1-0) to C$^{18}$O(1-0) line emission ratio as a function of galactocentric radius and star formation rate surface density to infer how different chemical and physical processes affect this ratio at cloud scales across different galactic environments: nuclear bar, molecular ring, northern and southern spiral arms. In line with previous studies conducted at kiloparsec scales for nearby star-forming galaxies, we find a moderate positive correlation with galactocentric radius and a moderate negative correlation with star formation rate surface density across the field-of-view (FoV), with slight variations depending on the galactic environment. We propose that selective nucleosynthesis and changes in the opacity of the gas are the primary drivers of the observed variations in the ratio.
#### Neural-Network Chemical Emulator for First-Star Formation: Robust Iterative Predictions over a Wide Density Range

 - **Abstract**
 We present a neural-network emulator for the thermal and chemical evolution in Population~III star formation. The emulator accurately reproduces the thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H, H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10% in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method, where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time. This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.
#### What do we mean by stellar mass? The impact of the pre-main sequence on the mass to light ratio of young and intermediate age stellar populations

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar population synthesis models are an essential tool with which galaxy physical parameters are extracted from observations. However they are built on assumptions designed for use in the local Universe, and not always appropriate to high redshift galaxies. Here we consider the impact of including the hitherto-neglected stellar pre-main sequence delay timescale on the interpretation of composite stellar populations at ages of <1 Gyr. We find that doing so has an impact on the optical luminosity of very young stellar populations of up to ~10 per cent, although smaller changes in observed light (<5 per cent) are expected in most use cases. However the impact on the inferred stellar mass and mass-to-light ratios is significant (a factor of 2 or more), depending on how those properties are defined. We find that the short time scales for star formation in the distant Universe require a clearer definition for the stellar mass in a population, and will impact assumptions about the inferred shape of the stellar initial mass function from observations.
#### A Comparison of Full Spectral Fitting Codes for Measuring the Stellar Initial Mass Function and Other Stellar Population Properties in Elliptical Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comparative test of four widely used full spectral fitting codes, with the aim of answering the question: how robust is the retrieval of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and other stellar properties of galaxies? We used ALF, PyStaff, Starlight, and pPXF to fit a set of optical+near-infrared spectroscopic data from the Magellan telescope of the two brightest galaxies in the Fornax cluster, NGC1399 and NGC1404. By fitting the same data set with the same models, we can compare the radial trends (out to ~ R_e) of IMF slope, age, metallicity and 19 elemental abundances when allowed with the four codes. To further test the robustness of our analysis, we carried out parallel simulations by creating inputs with different star formation history (SFH) complexity. The results from simulations show that codes such as ALF and PyStaff, which both assume a simple stellar population (SSP) return greater precision and accuracy only when the underlying population is a pure SSP; however, in cases where the SFH is more complex, these codes return erroneous results. Although codes like Starlight and pPXF, which retrieve the best-fit SFH without prior assumptions, tend to produce results with greater scatter and bias, they are generally more reliable in identifying secondary components. Our analysis on the two targets shows that ALF and PyStaff, that assume an SSP, give results pointing to a single old age, a decreasing metallicity with radius and a flat super-Salpeter IMF. In contrast, Starlight and pPXF suggest the presence of a secondary component with different metallicity and IMF characteristics.
#### Thermal-orbital evolution of Eris

 - **Abstract**
 The large Kuiper Belt object (KBO) Eris is nearly as big as Pluto and has a small moon, Dysnomia. Constraints on the system's spin and orbit characteristics were recently used to argue for a dissipative Eris, requiring a differentiated structure but not necessarily a subsurface ocean. Here, we model the thermal history of Eris coupled to its spin-orbital evolution, finding a subsurface ocean is preferred in order for Eris to be sufficiently dissipative. Spinning down Eris without an ocean is difficult, requiring a warm convecting ice shell protected by a thick insulating layer and very dissipative anelastic behavior in ice. Oceans make up 77-100% of successful thermal-orbital evolution models, depending on the parameters assumed, which increases to >98% when the Andrade $\beta$ parameter for ice is restricted to $\beta\leq3\times10^{-11}$ Pa$^{-1}$ s$^{-0.25}$. Oceans freeze over by the present day unless insulation (porosity, gas clathrates) or antifreeze are present.
