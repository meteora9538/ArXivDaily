 - **Abstract**
 Astrometry, one of the oldest branches of astronomy, has been revolutionized by missions like Hipparcos and especially Gaia, which mapped billions of stars with extraordinary precision. However, challenges such as detecting Earth-like exoplanets in nearby habitable zones and probing the influence of dark matter in galactic environments require sub-microarcsecond accuracy. With a 6--8 meter large-aperture telescope operating across at visible wavelengths, the Habitable Worlds Observatory by NASA can combine astrometry and direct imaging to detect rocky exoplanets within 10 parsecs and study their atmospheres. We consider here the scientific requirements and present a concept for a dedicated astrometric instrument on HWO. It is capable to produce diffraction-limited images of large fields, achieving a point-spread function (PSF) precision of 20 milliarcseconds. Equipped with a detector calibration system, HWO can perform high precision astrometry, and, detect and measure the orbit of Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone of Nearby Solar-type stars. HWO can dramatically improve current constraints on the self- interaction cross-section of heavy dark matter particles (WIMPs) and on the masses of ultra-high dark matter particles, through the study of stellar motions in galactic environments. The visible channel of the instrument features a large CMOS-based focal plane with stitched pixel arrays, enabling a large field of view. The ``Detector Calibration Unit'' system uses interferometric laser fringes to calibrate pixel positions. Using differential astrometry and pointed observations with a stable telescope design enables extended integration times, enhancing sensitivity to sub-microarcsecond precision for detecting exoplanets and studying dark matter through stellar motion.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive investigation into the influence of stellar bars on star formation (SF) in galaxy pairs, using a large sample of low-redshift galaxies ($0.02$\,$<$\,z\,$<$\,$0.08$) from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR8. Our analysis examines whether bars enhance or suppress SF during pair interactions, and how these outcomes depend on the star-forming properties of companion galaxies. We find that bars either catalyze or inhibit SF in their host galaxies, depending on the companion's SF activity. In particular, barred galaxies paired with actively star-forming companions experience more pronounced central starbursts (with sSFR up to $\sim$\,2.5 dex higher) than unbarred counterparts, whereas those with passive companions often have suppressed SF (sometimes below isolated galaxy levels). The notion of the dual role of bars can reconcile conventional conflicting reports of bar-driven enhancement versus quenching of SF activity. Bars, well known to regulate kpc-scale dynamics, may also link to the impact of external environments: when a star-forming companion provides sufficient gas, bars drive central starbursts, whereas in gas-poor interactions, bars hasten gas depletion and contribute to SF suppression. This work highlights the necessity of accounting for both internal structure and companion properties to fully understand SF regulation in interacting galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic warps are common in disk galaxies. While often attributed to galaxy--galaxy tides, a non-spherical dark matter (DM) halo has also been proposed as a driver of disk warping. We investigate links among warp morphology, satellite distribution, and large-scale structure using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey catalog of warped disks compiled by Zee et al.\ (2022). Warps are classified into 244 S and 127 U types, hosting 1,373 and 740 satellites, respectively, and are compared to an unwarped control matched in stellar mass, redshift, and local density. As an indirect, population-level proxy for the host halo's shape and orientation, we analyze the stacked spatial distribution of satellites. Warped hosts show a significant anisotropy: an excess at $45^{\circ}<\phi<90^{\circ}$ (measured from the host major axis), peaking at $P(\phi)\simeq 0.003$, versus nearly isotropic controls. Satellites of S-type warps preferentially align with the nearest cosmic filament, whereas those of U-type warps are more often perpendicular. The incidence of warps increases toward filaments ($r_{\rm fil}<4,{\rm Mpc},h^{-1}$), while the number of satellites around warped hosts remains approximately constant with filament distance, indicating a direct influence of the large-scale environment. We discuss possible links between galactic warps and the cosmic web, including anisotropic tidal fields and differences in evolutionary stage.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of molecular gas on small scales regulates star formation and the growth of supermassive black holes in galaxy centers, yet the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in shaping this distribution remains poorly constrained. We investigate how AGN influence the small-scale structure of molecular gas in galaxy centers, by measuring the clumpiness of CO(3 - 2) emission observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the nuclear regions (50 - 200 pc from the AGN) of 16 nearby Seyfert galaxies from the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). To quantify clumpiness, we apply three different methods: (1) the median of the pixel-by-pixel contrast between the original and smoothed maps; (2) the ratio of the total excess flux to the total flux, after substracting the background smoothed emission; and (3) the fraction of total flux coming from clumpy regions, interpreted as the mass fraction in clumps. We find a negative correlation between molecular gas clumpiness and AGN X-ray luminosity (L_X), suggesting that higher AGN activity is associated with smoother gas distributions. All methods reveal a turnover in this relation around L_X = 10^{42} erg/s, possibly indicating a threshold above which AGN feedback becomes efficient at dispersing dense molecular structures and suppressing future star formation. Our findings provide new observational evidence that AGN feedback can smooth out dense gas structures in galaxy centers.

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning has the potential to improve the reconstruction of the dark matter profile of galaxies with respect to traditional methods, like rotation curves. We demonstrate on the simulation suite Illustris-TNG that a steerable equivariant convolutional neural network (CNN) is able to infer the dark matter profiles within and around individual galaxies from photometric and interferometric data, improving on a standard CNN. Within the in silico environment of the simulations, our architecture is able to capture the dark matter distribution within galaxies without a parametrization of the profile. We perform an interpretability analysis to understand the internal mechanisms of the trained model and the most important data features used to estimate the dark matter profiles. The equivariant CNN recovers the dark matter profile of galaxies within the stellar mass range $[10^{10} - 10^{12} ]$ $M_{\odot}$ with excellent precision and accuracy: the mean squared error is reduced by a factor of ~ 3 from its value under the training distribution, demonstrating that the network has learnt from the data features. While this holds within the controlled 'in silico' environment of the simulation, we argue that few additional steps are needed before this method can be reliably applied to galaxies in the real field observations.
#### Intermediate-Mass Stripped Stars in the Magellanic Clouds: Forward Modeling the Observed Population Discovered Via UV Excess

 - **Abstract**
 Stripped stars are hot, helium-rich stars formed when binary interactions remove a star's hydrogen envelope. While low-mass ($\lesssim 1\,M_\odot$) and high-mass ($\gtrsim 8\,M_\odot$) stripped stars are well studied as hot subdwarfs and Wolf-Rayet stars, their intermediate-mass counterparts ($1-8 \,M_\odot$) have only recently been discovered. The Stripped-Star Ultraviolet Magellanic Cloud Survey (SUMS) identified UV-excess sources in the Magellanic Clouds using Swift-UVOT photometry and selected 820 photometric stripped-star candidates. However, the selection function, completeness, and purity of this sample remain poorly understood. We forward model the population of stripped stars in the Magellanic Clouds using a binary population synthesis model combined with spatially resolved star formation histories and simulated UV photometry. To assess survey sensitivity, we inject simulated sources into real Swift-UVOT images and reproduce the SUMS selection process, including crowding, extinction, and photometric quality cuts. We recover $\sim 250$ simulated stripped stars with masses $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$, which corresponds to a recover rate of $9-13\,\%$. The rest are missed due to dilution by luminous companions, crowding, and high extinction. The observed population is biased toward systems with low-mass companions formed by common envelope evolution and toward systems with compact object companions. Of the stripped stars which show UV excess, $25-45\,\%$ are identifiable by SUMS; higher-resolution data or improved reddening corrections are needed to detect the rest. We predict contamination of the observed stripped star candidates by main-sequence stars with spurious UV excess due to crowding and provide guidelines for selecting higher-purity subsamples. These results enable tests of binary evolution models and realistic comparison of observed and simulated stripped-star populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic macroscopic plasma dynamics can be described by general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. In many high-energy astrophysical settings, such as the interior dynamics of magnetized stars, the ideal GRMHD approximation, in which we assume infinite conductivity, provides an excellent description. However, ideal GRMHD neglects resistive effects that are essential for processes such as magnetic reconnection, dissipation, and magnetospheric dynamics. Incorporating resistivity into astrophysical plasma models accounts for the fact that plasmas in such environments are not perfect conductors. We present a resistive version of the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code GRaM-X, which evolves the full resistive GRMHD equations using the Z4c formalism for Einstein's equations. We implement a second-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme to handle stiff source terms, obtain the primitive quantities from the conserved quantities using a one-dimensional recovery method, and employ the HLLE Riemann solver in combination with TVD and WENO reconstruction schemes. We validate the module using a range of standard tests, including 1D shocktubes, current sheets, Alfvén waves, 2D cylindrical explosions, and 3D TOV stars. The results of these tests demonstrate accurate recovery of the ideal MHD limit, correct resistive behavior, and stable evolution in dynamical spacetimes. Leveraging the GPU-accelerated resistive version of GRaM-X enables efficient large-scale simulations, paving the way for realistic studies of binary mergers, accretion flows, and relativistic jets within the framework of multi-messenger astrophysics.
#### Accreted stars and stellar haloes of simulated galaxies in TNG50

 - **Abstract**
 We use the TNG50 cosmological hydrodynamic simulation to study the accreted stellar component and stellar haloes of isolated galaxies spanning a wide range of masses ($10^8<M_*/M_\odot<10^{11}$). We find that stars formed in the main progenitor (i.e., in-situ stars) typically dominate the inner regions as far as $\sim$10 half-light radii from the centre, implying that detecting uncontrovertible evidence for the presence of an accreted stellar halo requires probing the far outskirts of a galaxy. Stars from accreted, disrupted satellites (i.e., ex-situ stars) dominate beyond that radius (roughly $25\%$ of the virial radius, $r_{200}$), which we identify as the inner boundary of the outer stellar halo. The fraction of accreted stars decreases monotonically with decreasing galaxy mass, $M_*$, from $\sim$$20\%$ on average in $\sim$$2\times 10^{12}\, M_\odot$ haloes ($M_*\sim$$10^{11}\, M_\odot$) to $2$-$3\%$ in $\sim$$2\times 10^{10}\, M_\odot$ haloes ($M_*\sim$$10^{8}\, M_\odot$). The outer halo has a mass comparable to roughly $10\%$ of all accreted stars. Fewer than $\sim$$30\%$ of stars in the outer halo are in-situ stars, many of which originate from star-forming satellites during the late stages of disruption, especially in low-mass systems. Accreted stars are systematically more metal poor in less massive systems, which makes the outer haloes of dwarf galaxies a fertile hunting ground for extremely metal-poor stars. At given galaxy mass, the more massive stellar haloes are systematically more concentrated (smaller $R_{\rm eff}$) and have steeper density profiles (larger $n$). Our results provide a blueprint for interpreting observations of the outskirts of isolated galaxies in terms of their assembly histories.

 - **Abstract**
 Using HST/STIS observations, we present the highest-spatial-resolution spectroscopic study to date of four tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies, with the best observed being the post-starburst (PSB) host of ASASSN-14li. The stellar population of ASASSN-14li's host, within 44 pc of the nucleus, reveals a younger recent starburst ($\sim$340 Myr) compared to the population at an offset radius of 88 pc that excludes the nucleus ($\sim$550 Myr), a radial age gradient suggesting gas inflows from a minor merger. We estimate a stellar density of $\sim5900 \pm 800 \, M_\odot / \mathrm{pc}^3$ within 30 pc of the nucleus of ASASSN-14li's host, exceeding densities expected for nuclear star clusters. High-ionization ``coronal" emission lines, [Fe VI] $\lambda 5677$, [Fe VII] $\lambda 6087$, and [Fe X] $\lambda 6375$, are also detected within the nuclear spectra of the hosts of ASASSN-14li and PTF09ge, importantly alongside the non-detection of [O III] at the same scale. We similarly do not detect [O III] in the nuclear region of ASASSN-14ae's host despite its presence in the SDSS spectrum. The different ionization radiation levels detected at various radii from TDE host nuclei may indicate echoes of earlier accretion episodes, including, potentially, a prior TDE. We posit that a minor merger driving gas inflow to the nucleus could drive the enhanced TDE rates in post-starburst galaxies, inducing variation in nuclear gas properties and star formation history on $<$150 pc scales in TDE hosts.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies exhibit a tight correlation between their star-formation rate and stellar mass over a wide redshift range known as the star-forming main sequence (SFMS). With JWST, we can now investigate the SFMS at high redshifts down to masses of $\sim10^6$ M$_{\odot}$, using sensitive star-formation rate tracers such as H$\alpha$ emission -- which allow us to probe the variability in star formation histories. We present inferences of the SFMS based on 316 H$\alpha$-selected galaxies at $z\sim4$-$5$ with $\log(\rm M_\star/M_\odot) = 6.4$ -$10.6$. These galaxies were identified behind the Abell 2744 lensing cluster with NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the ``All the Little Things'' (ALT) survey. At face value, our data suggest a shallow slope of the SFMS (SFR $\propto \mathrm{M}_\star^\alpha$, with $\alpha=0.45$). After correcting for the H$\alpha$-flux limited nature of our survey using a Bayesian framework, the slope steepens to $\alpha = 0.59^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, whereas current data on their own are inconclusive on the mass dependence of the scatter. These slopes differ significantly from the slope of $\approx1$ expected from the observed evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and from simulations. When fixing the slope to $\alpha=1$, we find evidence for a decreasing intrinsic scatter with stellar mass (from $\approx 0.5$ dex at M$_\star=10^8$ M$_\odot$ to $0.4$ dex at M$_\star=10^{10}$ M$_\odot$). This tension might be explained by a (combination of) luminosity-dependent SFR(H$\alpha$) calibration, a population of (mini)-quenched low-mass galaxies, or underestimated dust attenuation in high-mass galaxies. Future deep observations across facilities can quantify these processes, enabling better insights into the variability of star formation histories.
#### Evidence of Energy Injection in the Short and Distant GRB 250221A

 - **Abstract**
 We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the short-duration GRB 250221A ($T_{90}=1.80\pm0.32$ s), using a data set from the optical facilities COLIBRÍ, the Harlingten 50 cm Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We complement these observations with data from the \textit{Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory} and the \textit{Einstein Probe}, as well as radio observations from the Very Large Array. GRB 250221A is among the few short GRBs with direct afterglow spectroscopy, which gives a secure redshift determination of $z=0.768$ and allows the unambiguous identification of the host as a galaxy with a star-formation rate of $\sim3\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The X-ray and optical light curves up to $T_0+10$ ks (where $T_0$ refers to the GRB trigger time) are well described by forward-shock synchrotron emission in the slow-cooling regime within the standard fireball framework. However, at $T_0+0.6$ days, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the same interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet with a half-opening angle of $\theta_j=11.5^{\circ}$ through a refreshed shock powered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The burst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the Amati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling of the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$), which is more typical of a Collapsar environment. This tension over the classification of this burst (short-hard vs. long-soft) as inferred from the prompt and afterglow emissions makes GRB~250221A an unusual event and underscores the limitations of duration-based classifications and the importance of multi-wavelength, time-resolved follow-up observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Eighteen years after their discovery, the astronomical sources and radiation mechanisms of fast radio bursts remain mysterious. Their radiation is as bright as that of pulsars, with brightness temperatures as high as $\sim 10^{36}$ K, implying coherent emission, but the plasma physics that forms the coherent charge bunches, with net charges of order a Coulomb, is not understood. Some FRB have been identified with galaxies at redshifts of a few tenths, but one originated within a globular cluster in the galaxy M81 at a distance of 3.6 Mpc. A minority of FRB have been observed to repeat, in some cases thousands of times. The vast majority of FRB have not been observed to repeat, but it is not known if they are truly ``one-offs'' or repeat at unobservably long intervals. Some FRB originate within dense, rapidly varying, plasma environments, while others appear to be surrounded by high vacuum. Hypotheses for their sources include magnetars and black hole accretion discs.

 - **Abstract**
 In this thesis, we introduce novel methods for analyzing pulsar populations using a variety of mathematical techniques. These tools-particularly graph theory-have been thoroughly validated in advanced mathematics, enabling us to overcome some of the constraints (even dimensional) inherent in conventional visualization approaches. This exploration benefits from dimensionality reduction techniques, which not only lessen computational demands but also highlight potential for describing physical characteristics. The resulting structures encode information about pulsar similarities that extend beyond standard spin parameters, revealing relationships that are not readily apparent in traditional diagrams. With a physically motivated topological perspective, we leverage the strengths of these methods and present results that span from prospective source classification and the emergence of new classes to catalog comparison, among other applications. This new approach enables fresh interpretations of longstanding problems, laying a new foundation for visualizing the pulsar population and categorizing sources. Building on this, we identify several sources as likely members of specific binary subclasses and investigate the potential transitional nature of others. Furthermore, we extend the use of graph theory to the boundary of machine learning, demonstrating its capability for binary separation in an unsupervised context. Finally, we introduce and apply an innovative, flexible time-series alignment technique to the field of gamma-ray astrophysics. The method identifies notable similarities among the light curves of gamma-ray pulsars. The results presented here are promising, offering a refreshing direction for the field and new pathways for rigorous mathematical analysis, ultimately providing meaningful alternatives to traditional approaches in high-energy astrophysics.
#### The impact of superradiance on the spin evolution of variably accreting massive black holes

 - **Abstract**
 This paper explores how time-varying increases in mass accretion onto rapidly spinning black holes influence their long-term spin evolution when affected by superradiance - a process where energy is extracted from the black hole by a surrounding axion field. Using simulations the study tracks how sudden accretion boosts affect a critical spin-down phase (the superradiance drop) during which the black hole's spin rapidly decreases while its mass remains nearly constant. The black hole spin evolution is controlled by the competition between two processes: how fast angular momentum is added through accretion, and how fast it is removed by the axion cloud. One major conclusion is that boosts to the accretion rate before the superradiance drop have the strongest effect, as they can delay or reshape the drop and significantly shrink the region of the mass-spin plane depopulated due to the superradiance. In particular, a super-Eddington accretion rate of 5 times Eddington accretion, lasting for 4 Myr and occurring 30 Myr before the superradiance drop can reduce the superradiance exclusion region in the mass-spin plane by 40 percent. In contrast, boosts to the accretion rate after the superradiance drop only cause temporary changes in the black hole spin. The study also shows that black holes with lighter axion clouds are more sensitive to these early boosts and can show observable spin changes lasting tens to hundreds of millions of years. Heavier axion clouds, however, require much stronger or longer-lasting boosts to produce similar effects, making them more stable under variable accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) we performed an untargeted search for H I-bearing ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). We identified a core sample of 10 UDGs defined by $\mu_{g,0}\ge24$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and $R_{e}\ge1.5$ kpc, and a broader sample including 12 additional faint diffuse galaxies ($\mu_{g,0}\ge23.7$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and $R_{e}\ge1.3$ kpc). Within the core sample, we highlight the first discovery of a UDG pair. Their projected separation is just 75 arcsec (22 kpc at 61.9 Mpc), with a central H I velocity difference of 34 km s$^{-1}$. The North-Western UDG (WALLABY J104513-262755-UDG-1) has a larger H I reservoir, $\log_{10}(M_{HI}/\rm M_{\odot}) = 8.95\pm0.03$, compared to the South-Eastern UDG (WALLABY J104513-262755-UDG-2), $\log_{10}(M_{HI}/\rm M_{\odot}) = 8.60\pm0.04$. UDG-1's stellar mass and star formation rate are also approximately an order of magnitude larger at $\log_{10}(M_*/\rm M_{\odot}) = 8.07\pm0.12$ and $\log_{10}(SFR/\rm M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}) = -1.26\pm0.12$ respectively. The pair has an isolated local environment, with no other galaxies or H I sources within 30 arcmin (525 kpc) and $\pm1000$ km s$^{-1}$. However, in the context of the larger-scale structure, the pair is located outside the virial radius of the Hydra cluster, with its position on the phase-space diagram indicating that it is infalling into the cluster. The identification of this H I-bearing UDG pair raises important questions around the formation of such a unique system and the evolution of UDGs in a transitional phase before ram pressure stripping and cluster infall.

 - **Abstract**
 In the vicinity of neutron star mergers (NSMs), it is possible for the neutrino self-interaction potential to cancel with the matter potential leading to matter neutrino resonance (MNR). MNR is one of the most interesting mechanisms by which neutrino flavor evolution can occur in dense astrophysical environments. Previous studies have typically assumed that the neutrino flavor field evolves to a steady state -- a simplification also used in other self-interaction models such as the neutrino-bulb model. Here, we perform reproducible calculations of MNR using both time-independent and time-dependent formalisms and show that they yield qualitatively different flavor survival probabilities. The time-independent approach produces unstable steady-state solutions that differ fundamentally from the dynamical behavior captured in time-dependent simulations. These results demonstrate that the steady-state assumption is generally invalid, and physical interpretations based on time-independent calculations of dense neutrino systems require re-evaluation.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric tomography, the problem of reconstructing atmospheric turbulence profiles from wavefront sensor measurements, is an integral part of many adaptive optics systems. It is used to enhance the image quality of ground-based telescopes, such as for the Multiconjugate Adaptive Optics Relay For ELT Observations (MORFEO) instrument on the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). To solve this problem, a singular-value decomposition (SVD) based approach has been proposed before. In this paper, we focus on the numerical implementation of the SVD-based Atmospheric Tomography with Fourier Domain Regularization Algorithm (SAFR) and its performance for Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems. The key features of the SAFR algorithm are the utilization of the FFT and the pre-computation of computationally demanding parts. Together, this yields a fast algorithm with less memory requirements than commonly used Matrix Vector Multiplication (MVM) approaches. We evaluate the performance of SAFR regarding reconstruction quality and computational expense in numerical experiments using the simulation environment COMPASS, in which we use an MCAO setup resembling the physical parameters of the MORFEO instrument of the ELT.
#### FAUST. XXVIII. High-Resolution ALMA Observations of Class 0/I Disks: Structure, Optical Depths, and Temperatures

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution (~7.5 au) ALMA observations at 1.3 and 3 mm of 16 disks around Class 0/I protostars across multiple star-forming regions and a variety of multiplicities, showing a range of disk sizes (~2-100 au) and including circumbinary disks (CBDs) in binaries with separations <100 au. The disk properties show similarities to Class II disks, including (a) low spectral index (SI) values (alpha=2.1) that increase with disk radius, (b) 3 mm disk sizes only marginally smaller than at 1.3 mm (<10%), and (c) radial intensity profiles well described by modified self-similar profiles. We also find key differences: (i) SI values increasing with radius, but exceeding 2 only at the disk edge (ii) higher brightness temperatures Tb, in some cases higher than the predicted temperatures due to irradiation, and (iii) ~10x higher luminosity at a given size compared to the Class II disks. These results confirm significant optical depth in the observed Class 0/I disks, at both 1.3 and 3 mm, helping to explain their higher luminosities, but higher temperatures are also required for the most compact (< 40 au) disks, suggesting additional viscous heating. Considering optical depth, most disk dust masses are estimated in the range 30-900 Mearth (0.01-0.3 Msun in gas), resulting in some disks reaching marginal gravitational instability. The median location of the water iceline is ~3 au, but it can extend beyond 10-20 au for the hottest disks. CBDs exhibit lower optical depths at both wavelengths and hence higher SI values (alpha=3.0), dust masses of 100 Mearth, and beta~1.5 (2 Class 0 CBDs) and beta~1 (1 Class I CBD), suggesting substantial grain growth only in the more evolved CBD. The inferred high optical depths provide a compelling explanation for the apparent scarcity of dust substructures in the younger disks at ~ 1 mm, despite mounting evidence for early planet formation (ABRIDGED).

 - **Abstract**
 This perspective offers a viewpoint on how the challenges of molecular scattering investigations of astrophysical interest have evolved in recent years. Computational progress has steadily expanded collisional databases and provided essential tools for modeling non-LTE astronomical regions. However, the observational leap enabled by the JWST and new observational facilities has revealed critical gaps in these databases. In this framework, two major frontiers emerge: the characterization of collisional processes involving heavy projectiles, and the treatment of ro-vibrational excitation. The significant computational effort of these investigations emphasizes the need to test and develop robust theoretical methods and approximations, capable of extending the census of collisional coefficients required for reliable astrophysical modeling. Recent developments in these directions are outlined, with particular attention to their application and their potential to broaden the coverage of molecular systems and physical environments.
#### The magnetic sensitivity of the Ca II resonance and subordinate lines in the solar atmosphere

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: The polarization of the Ca II resonant doublet (H and K lines) and the subordinate infrared triplet lines are key observables for diagnosing solar chromospheric magnetism. It is thus necessary to understand the physical mechanisms that shape their Stokes profiles in magnetic environments. Methods: Using the spectral synthesis module of the HanleRT-TIC code, we study the effects of anisotropic radiation pumping with partial frequency redistribution (PRD) and J-state interference (JSI) in a plane-parallel semi-empirical static solar atmospheric model. We also analyze the sensitivity of these lines to magnetic fields of varying strengths and orientations, accounting for the combined action of the Hanle and Zeeman effects. Results: Including PRD is crucial to model the polarization in the core regions of the resonant lines, while JSI strongly affects their far wings. The metastable lower levels of the subordinate lines also influence the scattering polarization of the K line. With horizontal magnetic fields, the resonant lines respond to field strengths from sub-gauss to tens of gauss, whereas the infrared triplet scattering polarization is mainly sensitive to milligauss fields. At a near-limb line of sight (LOS) with $\mu = 0.1$, the Hanle effect modifies the scattering polarization via a depolarization and a rotation in the plane of linear polarization. At disk center, horizontal fields generate linear polarization in the 1D model: for the K line, the Hanle effect dominates from sub-gauss to a few tens of gauss, and the Zeeman effect dominates in stronger fields. For vertical fields, the Hanle effect vanishes, but magneto-optical effects affect the linear polarization wings. Finally, atomic level polarization impacts the outer circular polarization lobes of the resonant lines, and the weak-field approximation overestimates the LOS magnetic component in this frequency range.

 - **Abstract**
 Among the emerging excess of massive, bright galaxies at Cosmic Dawn $z \gtrsim 9$ seen by the James Webb Space Telescope, several exhibit spectral features associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN). These AGN candidates suggest that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow rapidly in the early Universe. In a series of numerical experiments, we investigate how SMBHs grow within and influence the most massive galaxies at Cosmic Dawn using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations run with the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES. Our suite of simulations explore how super-Eddington accretion, seed mass, and the strength of feedback influence SMBH-galaxy co-evolution in the early Universe. We find that SMBH growth is sensitive to stellar feedback which generates a turbulent-multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) that stochastically starves the SMBH. In the absence of AGN feedback, we find that the SMBH is starved $\sim 50\%$ of the time after the onset of star formation in the galaxy. SMBH growth can become self-regulated by AGN feedback if the SMBH becomes massive enough, either by accretion or seeding, for its feedback to dominate the surrounding nuclear region. We find no evidence of galaxy-scale, AGN-driven quenching in the star formation rate (SFR) across all simulations in our suite.
