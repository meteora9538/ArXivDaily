#### Hot Jupiters in Old Wide-Binary Systems

 - **Abstract**
 Hot Jupiters (HJs) are giant planets with orbital periods shorter than $10$ days, found around $\sim 0.5$-$1\%$ of Sun-like stars. Their origins remain debated despite decades of study. The high prevalence of stellar companions, the eccentricity distribution of 'Cold' Jupiters on longer orbits, and the wide range of stellar spin-orbit misalignments support high-eccentricity migration: planets are excited to eccentric orbits and subsequently circularised via tidal dissipation. Existing high-eccentricity migration models, however, are inefficient in converting the initial population of Cold Jupiters to HJs. Current models reproduce at most $\lesssim 30\%$ of observed HJs, while the resulting Cold/Hot Jupiter ratios ($\gtrsim 30$) overproduce the observed values of $10$-$15$. These models also fail to form HJs around old stars ($\gtrsim 3$ Gyr) on short tidal decay timescales (e.g., $<40$ Myr). Here we show that wide binaries ($a > 10^3$ au) perturbed by the Galactic tidal field produce $1.8\pm 0.14$ more HJs compared to isolated binary systems, accounting for $26$-$40\%$ of the observed population under conservative assumptions. Wide-binaries predominantly produce Gyr-old systems, consistent with the host-age distribution for $t \ge 2.5\ \rm Gyr$. In $\sim 20\%$ of cases, wide-binary perturbations eject giant planets entirely, resolving the Cold/Hot Jupiter ratio discrepancy while naturally seeding the population of free-floating giant planets. In our dynamical framework, wide binaries emerge as active agents that reshape planetary demographics across billions of years. These results will be decisively tested by forthcoming exoplanet and microlensing surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1) to identify stellar members of the Local Group dwarf galaxies. We cross-match DESI targets with candidate members that are based on Gaia proper motions, positions, and photometry. The addition of DESI radial velocities enables secure membership determination in 16 systems, spanning ultra-faint, classical, and irregular dwarf galaxies. Our results confirm that Gaia-based selection algorithms are effective in minimising foreground contamination. With DR1, we find the largest number of member stars for Draco and Sextans. While Draco is discussed in detail in other works, we focus on Sextans and, for the first time with DESI, trace its stellar kinematics to large radii (up to $\sim$10~half-light radii). Our derived systemic velocity and velocity dispersion are consistent with previous works. We find that the more metal-poor population exhibits a higher velocity dispersion and extends to larger radii, whereas the more metal-rich population is kinematically colder and centrally concentrated. The metallicity gradient is steeper in the inner regions of Sextans ($\sim -9\times 10^{-3}$~dex~arcmin$^{-1}$ or $\sim-0.29$~dex~kpc$^{-1}$), while almost no gradient in the outskirts, hinting for an ex-situ halo or for an ``outside-in'' star formation. Although DESI [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios for Sextans stars with [Fe/H]~$\gtrsim-2.0$ are in line with literature values, those for very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]~$\lesssim-2.0$) present a large scatter and strong anti-correlation with metallicity, warranting a caution for using DESI abundances in this regime. We find one ultra metal-poor candidate in Canes~Venatici~I, which requires higher resolution spectroscopic follow-ups.
#### The chemical DNA of the Magellanic Clouds V. R-process dominates neutron capture elements production in the oldest SMC stars

 - **Abstract**
 We present the chemical abundances of Fe, alpha- and neutron-capture elements in 12 metal-poor Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) giant stars, observed with the high-resolution spectrographs UVES/VLT and MIKE/Magellan. These stars have [Fe/H] between -2.3 and -1.4 dex, 10 of them with [Fe/H]<-1.8 dex. According to theoretical age-metallicity relations for this galaxy, these stars formed in the first Gyr of life of the SMC and represent the oldest SMC stars known so far. [alpha/Fe] abundance ratios are enhanced but at a lower level than MW metal-poor stars, as expected according to the slow star formation rate of the SMC. The sample exhibits a large star-to-star scatter in all the neutron-capture elements. The two r-process elements measured in this work (Eu and Sm) have abundance ratios from solar up to +1 dex, three of them with [Eu/Fe]>+0.7 dex and labeled as r-II stars. This [r/Fe] distribution indicates that the r-process in the SMC can be extremely efficient but is still largely affected by the stochastic nature of the main sites of production and the inefficient gas mixing in the early SMC evolution. A similar scatter is observable also for the s-process elements (Y, Ba, La, Ce, Nd), with the stars richest in Eu also being rich in these s-elements. Also, all the stars exhibit subsolar [s/Eu] abundance ratios. At the metallicities of these stars, the production of neutron-capture elements is driven by r-process, because the low-mass AGB stars have not yet evolved and left their s-process signature in the interstellar medium. We also present stochastic chemical evolution models tailored for the SMC that confirm this scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how mass and angular momentum flow through accretion discs remains a fundamental unsolved problem in astrophysics. Accreting white dwarfs offer an ideal laboratory for addressing this question: their variability occurs on accessible timescales of seconds to minutes, and their optical spectra contain continuum and emission-line components that trace distinct disc regions. Broad-band timing studies have revealed time-lags similar to those observed in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, suggesting propagating fluctuations and possible coupling to an inner hot flow. However, the blending of line and continuum light in broad filters prevents a physical interpretation of these signals. The 2040s will bring an unprecedented number of disc-accreting systems discovered by Rubin-LSST, space-based gravitational-wave observatories, and third-generation ground and space-based detectors. To extract disc physics from these sources, high-cadence optical spectral-timing, simultaneously resolving continuum and individual lines, is essential. Such measurements would directly map how variability propagates through discs, determine how the outer disc responds to changes in the inner flow, and test whether accretion physics is scale-invariant from white dwarfs to supermassive black holes. This white paper outlines the scientific motivation and observational capabilities required to realise this vision. It highlights the opportunity for ESO to enable a transformative new window on accretion physics in the coming decade.
#### Buried but not destroyed: the evolution from prompt cusps to NFW haloes

 - **Abstract**
 The internal structure of dark matter haloes encodes their assembly history and offers critical insight into the nature of dark matter and structure formation. Analytical studies and high-resolution simulations have recently predicted the formation of 'prompt cusps' - steep power-law density profiles that emerge rapidly from the monolithic collapse of primordial peaks. Yet, by $z=0$ most haloes are well described by Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profiles, raising the question of how these early cusps are transformed in a cosmological setting. We address this problem using 64 zoom-in $N$-body simulations of eight haloes, each resimulated with eight different free-streaming wavenumbers to control the abundance of small-scale structure while keeping the large-scale environment fixed. To mitigate numerical discreteness effects, we classify artificial fragments and genuine subhaloes with a physically motivated procedure based on matching subhaloes to their progenitor peaks. At the population level, we demonstrate that haloes initially form prompt cusps, and their profiles subsequently transition towards the NFW form. Our study reveals three distinct pathways by which prompt cusps evolve: major mergers, accretion of artificial fragments, and interactions with large-scale filaments, each having a distinct impact on the inner density profile. In particular, we show that the original power-law cusp remains visible in the profile of particles associated with the primordial peak even when the total halo profile is already NFW-like. This work highlights the imprint of early collapse on present-day halo structure and provides new insights into the origin of the universality of the NFW profile.

 - **Abstract**
 HD100546 represents a particularly interesting target to study dynamical planet-disk interactions as various features have been observed in both the dust and gas that provide direct and indirect evidence for ongoing planet formation. In this work, we aim to characterize the gas kinematics of five molecular CO emission lines observed with ALMA in HD 100546, to reveal deviations from Keplerian rotation as well as substructures in the peak intensity and line width. We fit the molecular intensity channels with the Discminer package to model the line profiles. Aside from fitting the full cube, we also conduct runs where the blue- and redshifted sides are modeled separately to search for possible asymmetries. Our analysis reveals prominent kinematical spiral features in all five lines on large scales of the disk and we reproduce their morphology with both a linear and logarithmic spiral. In 12CO 2-1, spirals are also seen in the peak intensity residuals, the line width residuals exhibit a prominent ring of enhanced line widths around 125-330 au. The models further show, that the emission from the redshifted side may originate from higher disk layers than that from the blueshifted side. The pitch angles of the spirals are consistent with those driven by an embedded companion inside of 50 au and they suggest a dynamical mechanism rather than gravitational instabilities. We further find indications of a companion around 90-150 au, where tentative dips are present in the radial profiles of the integrated intensity of 13CO and C18O and pressure minima are observed in the azimuthal velocities. For the first time, we also detect downward vertical flows in this region, which coincide with the observed dust gap. The asymmetry in the emission heights may be a result of infall from the disk's environment. Another explanation is provided by a warped inner disk, casting a shadow onto one side of the disk.
#### Connection between galaxy morphology and dark-matter halo structure II: predicting disk structure from dark-matter halo properties

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how galactic disk structures connect to the detailed properties of their host dark-matter halos using the TNG50 simulation. From the hydrodynamic and matched dark-matter-only runs, we measure a comprehensive list of halo properties describing density structure, angular momentum, shape, assembly history, and environment. Using the morphological decomposition developed in Paper I, we quantify the sizes, scale heights, and mass fractions of the disk components for galaxies at $0 \le z \le 4$. Random Forest (RF) regression shows halo properties alone predict disk size and thickness with high accuracy, while Symbolic Regression (SR) provides compact empirical relations with slightly lower accuracy. Disk height is consistently easier to predict than disk size, and lower-mass halos yield higher accuracy than massive halos. Predictions based on halo properties measured in the full-physics hydro simulations outperform those based on the matched dark-matter-only halos, reflecting the imprint of baryonic restructuring on the inner halo. SHAP analysis reveals that the most informative halo parameters include concentration, Einasto shape, global and inner spin, and recent mass accretion, though their importance varies across disk properties. We show that correlations between disk size and the density-profile shape arise primarily from disk-induced modification of the inner halo, rather than a primordial connection. Finally, we point out that disks become more extended with respect to their host halos at higher redshift in low-mass halos, while massive high-redshift halos show the opposite trend. We provide SR-based prescriptions that accurately map halo properties to disk structures, offering practical tools for galaxy-halo modeling.
#### Local Group dwarf galaxies as dark matter probes

 - **Abstract**
 Unveiling the fundamental nature of non-baryonic dark matter (DM) has profound implications for our understanding of the Universe and of the physical laws that govern it. Its manifestation as an additional source of matter necessary to explain astrophysical and cosmological observations indicates either a breakdown of General Relativity or that the current Standard Model of Particle Physics is incomplete. In the standard Cold DM (CDM) paradigm, DM consists of collisionless non-relativistic particles with negligible non-gravitational interactions. This simple hypothesis is very successful on large and intermediate scales, but faces challenges on small galactic scales. Local Group (LG) dwarf galaxies can play a fundamental role to elucidate whether these challenges stem from poorly understood fundamental baryonic processes or instead indicate that alternative DM scenarios need to be considered. In particular, a systematic determination of their DM halo properties as a function of stellar mass and star formation histories (SFH) will provide crucial observational benchmarks for models to deal with the trickiest issue that prevents us from advancing in our understanding of DM nature, i.e. the impact of baryonic processes in altering the properties of the inner regions of DM haloes. Such systematic study would require assembling accurate l.o.s. velocities (and metallicities) for several thousands of stars per galaxy, for an heterogeneous sample of target galaxies, spanning order of magnitudes in stellar mass and covering distances from about 100 kpc to more than 1 Mpc. This calls for both multi-objects spectrographs on 12m-class telescopes with fov of a few deg2 and a multiplex power in the several 1000s with the capability of providing dense sampling of the innermost regions, as well as for wide-area multi-objects spectrographs with fov of several arcmin2 on 30-40m class telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetospheres of neutron stars in the Galactic Center provide an exceptional environment to search for dark matter axions through their resonant conversion into photons. The combination of extreme magnetic fields and high dark matter density in this region creates ideal conditions for axion-photon conversion across the centimetre-to-submillimetre wavelength range. Detecting the cumulative emission from these neutron star populations demands a facility with unprecedented sensitivity, spatial resolution, and broad frequency coverage in the submillimetre domain, capabilities essential to explore a previously inaccessible region of axion parameter space.

 - **Abstract**
 Submillimetre molecular lines (e.g., CO, HCN, SiO) provide a uniquely powerful view of the physical and chemical processes that govern star formation (SF) and galaxy evolution. Yet, our current picture of the molecular universe beyond the Milky Way remains strikingly incomplete: broad chemical inventories exist for only a handful of galaxies, typically more extreme than the Milky Way, constrained by sensitivity limits and narrow survey strategies. In the 2040s, surveying galaxies with multi-species, multi-transitions observations across diverse galactic environments will be crucial to establish effective chemical diagnostics of the various ISM processes from the early universe to $z=0$. Extragalactic astrochemistry provides a uniquely sensitive probe of the physical processes shaping galaxies, allowing us to understand, species by species, how gas responds to its local environment and how galaxies grow, transform, and recycle matter over cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of cosmology, dark matter (DM), and high-redshift galaxy evolution, but current samples of strongly lensed galaxies (SLGs) remain far too small to exploit its full potential. $\textit{Herschel}$'s submillimeter (submm) surveys demonstrated that submm selection provides the most efficient and least biased route to identifying high-redshift SLGs, yet produced only a few hundred systems over limited, heterogeneous fields. Achieving the thousands of SLGs required for precision cosmology and detailed studies of distant dusty star-forming galaxies demands a new, wide-area, homogeneous sub-mm survey. A facility like AtLAST, capable of extending $\textit{Herschel}$-like methodologies to much larger areas, is uniquely positioned to deliver the order-of-magnitude increase in SLG numbers needed for transformative progress.
#### A wide-field, multi-line survey of CO in the Magellanic Clouds at parsec-scale resolution: characterising the molecular gas content with a 50-m single-dish submillimeter telescope

 - **Abstract**
 The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC) are nearby dwarf galaxies whose proximity uniquely enables molecular cloud-scale resolution observations across the entire Magellanic system, a capability unmatched in any other external galaxy. Their low metallicities resemble conditions near the peak of cosmic star formation, allowing resolved studies of interstellar medium (ISM) phases, molecular cloud lifecycles, and feedback processes that regulate galaxy evolution. Comprehensive, wide-field spectroscopic mapping of CO and its isotopologues in different transitions, complemented by [CI] observations, and combined with already existing HI and HII surveys, will calibrate star-formation laws and gas-phase partition under low-metallicity conditions and furnish benchmarks for interpreting high-redshift galaxies and cosmological simulations. This science requires a large-aperture, wide-field submillimeter single dish with multi-pixel spectroscopic capabilities, operated from a high, dry site such as Chajnantor, to deliver fast, sensitive, high-resolution, degree-scale mapping with total-power fidelity. We present the case for a full molecular atlas of the Magellanic system, the enabling facility requirements, and the transformative impact on galaxy evolution studies
#### Cold Gas Infall onto A Brightest Group Galaxy via A Gas-Rich Minor Merger

 - **Abstract**
 Dust and cold gas are not uncommon in nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs), and represent an important aspect of their evolution. However, their origin has been debated for decades. Potential sources include internal processes (e.g., mass loss from evolved stars), external mechanisms (e.g., minor mergers or cooling flows), or a combination of both. Gas-rich minor mergers have long been proposed as an important channel for cold gas fueling in both observations and simulations, but direct evidence of cold gas transportation via gas-rich minor mergers remains elusive, particularly in galaxy groups and clusters where environmental effects are prevalent. In this letter, we present the first unambiguous case of direct cold gas transportation onto a brightest group galaxy (BGG) at $z=0.25$, driven by an ongoing close-separation gas-rich minor merger with a mass ratio of $\sim1:56$. High-resolution JWST imaging reveals a heavily obscured, low-mass satellite that is barely visible at restframe optical wavelengths. Tidal stripping from this satellite deposits gas and dust onto the BGG, forming prominent $\sim$10 kpc dust lanes in situ. Cosmological simulations indicate that such interactions preferentially occur in gas-rich satellites undergoing their first infall in highly eccentric orbits. Our results highlight the pivotal role of gas-rich minor mergers in replenishing cold gas reservoirs and shaping the evolution of central ETGs in galaxy groups.
#### Investigating the Reionization Epoch through 21\,cm and Line Intensity Mapping Experiments

 - **Abstract**
 The epoch of reionization (EoR), marking the Universe's transition from a neutral to ionized state, represents a pivotal phase for understanding the formation of the first stars and galaxies. Intensity mapping of atomic and molecular lines, such as $[\mathrm{CII}]$ and CO J-ladder transitions, across a broad redshift range is a powerful tool for investigating star formation history, metallicity, the distribution of gas and dust, and the physical conditions within galaxies. Additionally, 21\,cm line intensity mapping directly probes the neutral hydrogen content in the intergalactic medium, offering a unique window into the timing and morphology of reionization. In this study, we explore the cross-correlation between the 21\,cm signal and multi-line intensity mapping (LIM) to forecast their detectability for next-generation experiments. Our analysis emphasizes the complementary potential of these techniques to constrain parameters such as the minimum mass of ionizing sources and the ionization fraction $x_e$. Cross-correlations with LIM also enable constraints on physical properties like metal enrichment and the relationship between star formation rates and multi-line luminosities. Using mock observations from Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-low 21\,cm and Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST)-like LIM experiments, we find that the $[\mathrm{CII}]$--21\,cm cross-correlation can constrain reionization history by measuring $x_e$ across multiple redshift bins with significance levels ranging from 9 to 40$\sigma$. We extend our analysis to CO transitions, showing that the CO(1-0)--21\,cm cross-correlation provides competitive constraints on reionization parameters. The synergies explored here will enable robust constraints on both reionization and LIM parameters, maximizing the scientific return of current and next-generation intensity mapping experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsar (MSP) binaries are unique laboratories for studying matter and radiation under extreme conditions that are unattainable on Earth. Recent detections of optical millisecond pulsations from three systems in distinct evolutionary stages have opened an entirely new observational window to investigate particle acceleration, pulsar-disk interplay, and intrabinary wind interactions. These discoveries reveal unexpectedly diverse emission mechanisms across accretion regimes, with optical efficiencies in some systems far exceeding those predicted by rotation-powered models. Despite decades of research, key questions remain unresolved: are optical pulsations a universal property of MSPs? How does the presence of an accretion disk boost the conversion of spin-down power into coherent optical emission? What physical processes drive the observed fast variability, and how do pulsar and companion winds regulate mass transfer and binary evolution? Addressing these fundamental problems requires high-time-resolution optical observations, rapid-response observing capabilities, and time-resolved spectroscopy at moderate spectral resolution to map disk and intrabinary-shock variability. Future facilities dedicated to time domain astronomy present a unique opportunity to perform a systematic exploration of optical pulsars across all MSP evolutionary stages for the first time and answer the above-mentioned fundamental questions.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently identified Abell 2744-QSO1 as a compact, metal-poor, black hole (BH) dominated galaxy at $z\simeq 7$. This system exhibits an extreme black-hole-to-stellar mass ratio and unusually low metallicity, posing significant challenges to BH seeding models. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform high-resolution cosmological simulations with a massive primordial black hole (PBH; $M_{\rm BH}=5\times10^7\,M_\odot$) seed, incorporating for the first time a fully coupled treatment of PBH accretion, BH feedback, and Population~III/II star formation and stellar feedback. Although PBHs accelerate structure formation through the seed effect, the associated strong thermal feedback from the accretion delays the onset of star formation to $z\lesssim 10$, producing short, bursty episodes throughout the subsequent evolution. PBH-driven outflows expel enriched gas from the nucleus, while sustained inflows from the intergalactic medium continuously replenish pristine material. This feedback-regulated cycle naturally yields low accretion rates ($\dot{m}_{\rm BH}/\dot{m}_{\rm edd} \sim 1-10\%$), subsolar metallicities ($Z/Z_\odot\lesssim10^{-2}$) and extreme $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios during both the initial star-forming phase and the subsequent quenching phases, in excellent agreement with JWST observations. Our results demonstrate that massive PBHs offer a viable pathway for forming the most extreme high-redshift systems, providing a physically motivated explanation for the extraordinary properties of Abell 2744-QSO1, as a sub-class of the broader population of JWST-discovered "little red dots".

 - **Abstract**
 There is growing evidence that the Sun might have formed within a nebula impacted by at least one SNR. In this scenario, ejecta and shocks from SNRs may have provided the elements on which life as we know it is based. Investigating the chemical complexity of molecular clouds impacted by SNRs is therefore essential to unveil the star formation process and how life appeared on Earth. In this paper, we exploit this scientific questions and describe which technical specifications will drive in future generation telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational campaigns with JWST have revealed a higher-than-expected abundance of UV-bright galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$, with various proposed theoretical explanations. A powerful complementary constraint to break degeneracies between different models is galaxy clustering. In this paper, we combine PANORAMIC pure parallel and legacy imaging along 34 independent sightlines to measure the cosmic variance ($\sigma_{\rm CV}$) in the number count of Lyman break galaxies at $z\sim10$ which is directly related to their clustering strength. We find $\sigma_{\rm CV}=0.96^{+0.20}_{-0.18}$, $1.46^{+0.54}_{-0.44}$, and $1.71^{+0.72}_{-0.59}$ per NIRCam pointing ($\sim9.7\,{\rm arcmin}^2$, $\lesssim1.5\,{\rm pMpc}$ at $z\sim10$) for galaxies with M$_{\rm UV}<-19.5$, $-20$, and $-20.5$. Comparing to galaxies in the UniverseMachine, we find that $\sigma_{\rm CV}$ is consistent with our measurements, but that the number densities are a factor $\gtrsim5$ lower. We implement simple models in the UniverseMachine that represent different physical mechanisms to enhance the number density of UV-bright galaxies. All models decrease $\sigma_{\rm CV}$ by placing galaxies at fixed M$_{\rm UV}$ in lower mass halos, but they do so to varying degrees. Combined constraints on $\sigma_{\rm CV}$ and the UVLF tentatively disfavor models that globally increase the star formation efficiency (SFE) or the scatter in the M$_{\rm UV}$-$M_{\rm halo}$ relation, while models that decrease the mass-to-light ratio, or assume a power-law scaling of the SFE with $M_{\rm halo}$ agree better with the data. We show that with sufficient additional independent sightlines, robust discrimination between models is possible, paving the way for powerful constraints on the physics of early galaxy evolution through NIRCam pure parallel imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations in the visible and near infrared are transforming our view of the processes affecting galaxy evolution, much of which is dominated by interactions with the large scale environment. Yet a complete picture is missing, as no corresponding high resolution view of the warm/hot intracluster, circumgalactic, and intergalactic media exists over large areas and a comparably broad range of redshifts. Combined with wide-field optical IFU surveys such as CATARSIS, a large diameter sub-mm telescope with a degree-scale field of view would enable a joint view of galaxy dynamics and gas thermodynamics, transforming our understanding of environmental processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy evolution is driven by processes occurring across a wide range of scales, from star formation within giant molecular clouds (parsec scales) to outflows and secular evolution across entire galaxies (kpc scales), and the interplay between galaxies, their dark matter haloes, and large-scale structures (Mpc scales). Connecting the distribution of baryonic matter and energy across these scales will remain one of the key challenges for both theoretical and observational astrophysics in the coming decade. A major development towards meeting this challenge has been the growing ability to obtain highly spatially resolved (parsec-scale) integral-field spectroscopic observations (e.g. with VLT/MUSE), as well as to probe the extremely low-surface brightness outskirts of galaxies at large radii and high vertical scale heights. To combine the two regimes, we need a paradigm shift in the way we do spectroscopy on galaxies, especially considering the ongoing and future photometric surveys. The next decade will also bring a revolution in extensive photometric surveys of large areas of the sky, uncovering low surface brightness features around nearby galaxies. However, to fully understand the processes that connect galaxies to their haloes, shape low surface brightness features, and drive secular evolution, spatially resolved spectroscopy will be essential. Here, we outline the need for wide-field spectroscopic observations of statistically significant samples of nearby galaxies and highlight the key questions that can only be addressed with such data

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of stars are born in clustered environments. In these environments, close encounters between young stars with planet-forming disks are expected to occur frequently. However, direct evidence of such interactions remains rare. Here, we report clear signatures of a recent dynamical interaction between the young stellar systems L1448 IRS3A and L1448 IRS3B. Millimeter wavelength observations reveal a distinct, tidally stripped bridge between the two systems. Together with previously reported spiral arm structures at the outer edge of the IRS3A disk and at the inner and outer regions of the IRS3B disk, these features imply that the systems are undergoing a dynamical flyby. Hydrodynamical simulations reproduce these features and suggest that the closest approach occurred about 15,000 yr ago. These findings offer rare insight into how stellar interactions can reshape disk structures and influence the formation of young multiple stellar systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Present-day galaxy clusters are the largest virialized structures in the Universe, yet their early assembly remains poorly understood. At z$>$2, clusters in formation span tens of Mpc and host gas-rich, dust-obscured galaxies embedded in extended, low-surface-brightness gaseous environments. Current (sub-)millimeter facilities lack the mapping speed, sensitivity, and contiguous field of view needed to trace the cold gas and dust driving rapid galaxy growth across such scales. A future large single-dish observatory with degree-scale coverage, broad spectral access, and high-multiplex capability would enable comprehensive and uniform mapping of entire protoclusters, revealing where star formation is triggered or quenched, and quantifying the cold gas budget, thus providing information on gas cooling within protocluster environments. In synergy with wide-sky optical/NIR surveys such as Euclid, LSST, and Roman, this facility would provide the missing multi-scale and multiphase submillimeter view needed to uncover how the stellar, gaseous, and dark-matter components assemble in protoclusters, completing our view of early structure formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary formation might occur at different stages of the stellar evolution of compact binaries. In recent years, the formation of second-generation planets has been tested in circumbinary discs formed by the ejection of stellar material from double white dwarf (DWD) binaries. In these environments, planets ranging from sub-Neptunian to giant masses can form and migrate to within 1 au of the central binary. Nevertheless, studies on the orbital stability of such systems have yet to be undertaken. In this work, we use N-body simulations to study the stability of multi-planet systems formed around compact DWDs in both resonant and non-resonant configurations over timescales of a few million years. We track the occurrence of catastrophic events and employ a variety of metrics, e.g., orbital spacing, centre-of-mass variations and Normalized Angular Momentum Deficit, to explore the outcomes of their evolution. Furthermore, we evaluate the potential for detecting these systems in their final configurations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission by measuring the overall gravitational-wave frequency shift amplitude induced by their planets. Our results show that planets orbiting DWDs can be stable over the studied timescales. While planetary systems starting with two-planets are more likely to survive unaltered, planetary systems with three, four or five planets, experience catastrophic events that cause them to lose some of their original planets, ending up hosting only two surviving planets in the majority of cases. This increases the number of two-planet systems by 122% with respect to their initial abundance and creates a single-planet population amounting to 7% of the totality of systems. The majority of these single-planet systems are potential candidates for LISA. Concerning multi-planet systems, a handful of systems could be detected.

 - **Abstract**
 We outline the science case for a 30-40 m optical/infrared telescope in the Northern Hemisphere, optimised for transformative time-domain astronomy in the 2040s. Upcoming multi-wavelength and multi-messenger facilities will reveal fast, faint, rapidly evolving Northern transients whose earliest phases carry decisive diagnostics. A Northern ELT with rapid response, broad wavelength coverage, high time resolution, polarimetric capabilities, and diffraction-limited imaging is essential to capture these phases and secure deep spectroscopy and photometry as transients fade. These capabilities will enable recovery of key physical information and detailed characterisation of transient environments, while also enabling unprecedented studies of accretion phenomena at all scales. Among potential sites, La Palma uniquely combines atmospheric stability, complementary longitude to ESO's ELT, protected dark skies, and robust infrastructure to host this facility.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the quenching of galaxies using a mock observational lightcone generated from the Semi-Analytic Model (SAM) L-Galaxies, closely matched to observations from the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS). The sample is used to study merging, rejuvenation, and visibility times for star-forming, quiescent, and post-starburst (PSB) galaxies, to assess the impact on the build-up of the passive galaxy mass functions. We find, for example, that a typical PSB ($M_\ast\sim10^{10}$\,M$_\odot$) at $z\approx1$ has a 15 per cent likelihood of merging and around a 25 per cent likelihood of rejuvenating within 1 Gyr of being identified. Applying these rates and timescales to the observational data, we estimate the fraction of quiescent galaxies that passed through a PSB phase. We find that $18 - 28$ per cent of the build-up in the massive end ($M_\ast>10^{10}$\,M$\,_\odot$) of the passive mass function at $1<z<2$ can be explained by PSBs, with the contribution declining to $\sim5$ per cent by $z \simeq 0.5$. Accounting for mergers and rejuvenation reduces the inferred PSB contribution by approximately a factor of two. At lower stellar masses ($M_\ast < 10^{10}$\,M$_\odot$), rapid quenching through a PSB phase explains a significantly larger fraction of the growth in the passive mass function. With a visibility time of $\sim$ 0.75 Gyr, we find that around $60-80$ per cent of low-mass passive galaxies underwent a PSB phase. Our findings provide further evidence that low- and high-mass galaxies follow different quenching pathways.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way (MW) is our unique laboratory to test star formation theories at the level of individual stars, serving as the Rosetta Stone to interpret extragalactic observations. The proposed White Paper focuses on the following key questions regarding the structure and evolution of the MW traced by young stellar populations: Q1. How do large-scale dynamical instabilities, like warps and vertical waves, drive the star formation of the Galactic thin disk? Q2. Do star-forming regions form stochastically, driven by local self-propagating feedback, or are they triggered by a common dynamical process acting on Galactic scales? Do internal feedback loops and external interactions tend to sustain or quench star formation in the MW? Q3. Are the clustered star-forming regions the only environments where stars form, or can stars also form in more diffuse structures such as the stellar strings?

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how the dynamical state of galaxy clusters influences their galaxy populations and mass distributions. Using photometrically selected clusters from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey cross-matched with the UNIONS galaxy shear catalogue, we classify clusters as evolved or evolving based on their rest-frame r-band magnitude gaps and stellar mass ratios between the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and bright satellites. We measure the stellar mass functions, weak-lensing profiles, and radial number density and red-fraction profiles of stacked clusters in both subsamples. Evolved clusters exhibit more concentrated lensing profiles, bimodal stellar mass functions dominated by massive BCGs, and a deficit of intermediate-mass satellites, while evolving clusters show flatter central lensing signals and an excess of massive satellites. Applying the same selection to IllustrisTNG clusters reproduces these trends and links the observed differences to distinct mass accretion histories. These results demonstrate the close link between cluster galaxy populations and the overall dynamical state of their underlying dark matter halo.

 - **Abstract**
 Increasing evidence shows that AGN with radio detections have more perturbed ionized gas kinematics and higher outflow detection rates, suggesting a link between radio emission and these processes. In galaxies with weak or ambiguous AGN signatures, some studies attribute the radio emission to star formation, while others propose AGN-driven winds or weak, unresolved jets as the dominant mechanism. To investigate this connection, we take a step back and analyze a sample of star-forming (SF) galaxies with no clear current AGN signatures. Using low-(LOFAR, 144MHz) and high-frequency (FIRST, 1.4GHz) surveys, combined with spatially resolved spectroscopy from the MaNGA survey, we compare SF galaxies with 144 MHz detections that either do or do not have GHz detections. Despite being matched in stellar mass, redshift, and radio (MHz) luminosity, GHz-detected SF galaxies systematically differ from their non-GHz-detected counterparts. The former display enhanced ionized gas-emission line widths, higher central outflow fractions, redder colors, increased central obscuration, and offset emission-line ratios that shift towards (or closer to) the AGN regime (in the [NII] BPT diagram). Furthermore, the non-GHz galaxies are likely undetected due to their extended radio morphologies, while the GHz-detected ones are significantly more radio compact. Most of the properties from the GHz-detected (compared to non-detected) remarkably resemble the behavior found in many studies of radio-detected AGNs. This suggests that the underlying physical mechanisms shaping GHz-detected SF galaxies properties are fundamentally similar. This raises intriguing questions about whether some compact SF galaxies represent a precursor phase of AGN evolution or a form of low-power AGN. The radio compact characteristic sizes of GHz-detected SF galaxies also suggest a connection between AGN and old starburst galaxies.
