#### An Investigation into the Low-Mass Fundamental Metallicity Relation in the Local and High-z Universe

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST/NIRSpec observations have revealed high-$z$ star-forming galaxies depart from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), yet the $z = 0$ FMR has not been well-characterized in the low-mass regime ($\rm log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 9$) for an appropriate comparison of low- and high-$z$ systems. We attempt to rectify this limitation through a meta-analysis, providing a local, observational comparison for future high-$z$ FMR studies. We analyzed common FMR fitting methods for $\sim 700$ [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ emitters with $\rm log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 9$ at $z \sim 0$. We find no evidence of the FMR below $\rm log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 9$ through any method, suggesting that slowly-evolving, quasi-steady state gas reservoirs are not yet established. We simultaneously find a weak positive correlation between metallicity and star formation, and that these systems are gas-rich with substantial diversity in effective yields ($y_{\rm eff}$) spanning $\rm \sim 3~dex$. We demonstrate increasing $y_{\rm eff}$ correlates with decreasing FMR offsets, which in the context of the analytical and non-equilibrium gas models of Dalcanton et al. (2007), indicates a scenario where star formation bursts rapidly return and eject metals from the ISM before subsequent gas-balancing. Pristine infall diluting the ISM metal-content cannot lead to the $y_{\rm eff}$ diversity we measure, and thus is not the primary process behind FMR deviations. Our results suggest low-$\rm M_{\star}$ systems, regardless of redshift, depart from a steady-state gas reservoir shaping the canonical FMR, in which metallicity variations are primarily driven by star formation and enriched outflows. With this characterization, we demonstrate $z \gtrsim 3$ [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ systems are indeed more metal-poor than $z \sim 0$ counterparts ($\rm \Delta 12+log(O/H) = 0.3~dex$) at fixed $\rm M_{\star}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) host multiple stellar populations differing in their chemical and dynamical properties. A number of models for the formation of multiple populations predict that the subsystem of second generation (SG) stars is characterized by a more centrally concentrated spatial distribution and a more rapid rotation than the system of first generation (FG) stars. We present the results of N-body simulations exploring the long-term dynamical evolution of rotating multiple-population GCs. We study the evolution of systems starting with four different orientations of the GC's total internal angular momentum vector relative to the orbital angular momentum. We explore the evolution driven by two-body relaxation and the effects of the GC's interaction with the galactic tidal field. We focus on the kinematic differences between the two generations and we quantify them by exploring the FG and SG rotation velocity and angular momenta. We find that kinematic differences between the generations persist for most of the GCs' lifetimes, although the strength of these differences decreases after a few relaxation times. The differences can be seen most clearly in the lowest-mass stars. We find that the GCs' internal angular momentum gradually aligns with the orbital angular momentum, although there is little difference in this alignment between the FG and SG systems. We also find that stars in the GC's outer regions align with the orbital angular momentum vector more rapidly than those in the inner regions leading to a variation of the orientation of the internal angular momentum with the clustercentric distance. The alignment between internal angular momentum and orbital angular momentum occurs more rapidly for low-mass stars. We study the evolution of the anisotropy in the velocity distribution and find the SG to be characterized by a stronger radial anisotropy than the FG.(abridged)
#### Wave-Mediated Boundary Layers of Accretion Discs: Role of Internal Structure of the Accretor

 - **Abstract**
 Disc accretion onto astrophysical objects with a material surface proceeds through the boundary layer (BL) -- a radially narrow region in the inner disc where the incoming gas must slow down its rotation before settling onto the surface of the accretor. Here we numerically study a BL in which the angular momentum transport in the layer is accomplished via the excitation of global acoustic waves. While the earlier studies of such wave-mediated BLs typically modeled the internal structure of the central object as a globally isothermal sphere with sharply rising density profile, here we explore the effect of other internal density and temperature profiles on the mode operation. We model the inner structure of an accretor as a polytropic sphere, allowing a shallower increase of density and a non-trivial temperature profile inside the object. While the mix of acoustic modes observed in our long-duration (1000 inner orbits long) 2D hydrodynamic simulations is a weak function of the polytropic index $n$ of the accretor's structure, the mass accretion rate and the angular momentum flux across the BL show a clear dependence on $n$, both decreasing in amplitude as $n$ is lowered. Interestingly, in 2D these transport metrics are better correlated not with $n$ but with a total mass inside the central object contained within the simulation domain. These results improve our understanding of the wave-mediated BL accretion by quantifying the effect of the inner structure of the accretor on the excitation and propagation of acoustic modes mediating the BL transport.
#### What is the True HI Gas Content in Massive Quiescent Galaxies in the Local Universe?

 - **Abstract**
 While massive quiescent galaxies are known to be poor in atomic hydrogen (HI), their true HI content remains poorly constrained due to the limited sensitivity and morphological biases of existing surveys. We present deep HI observations using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) for a representative sample of 78 low-redshift massive quiescent galaxies, selected by stellar mass ($M_\ast > 10^{10} M_\odot$) and color (NUV$-r > 5$). Our observations reach an exceptional detection limit of $\log(M_{HI}/M_\ast) = -3$. We find that one-third of the sample follows the predicted HI mass fraction distribution based on previous surveys. However, the majority ($\sim$2/3) exhibit significantly lower HI content, with a $3\sigma$ upper limit of $\log(M_{HI}/M_\ast) < -3.46$ derived from stacking the non-detections. As a consequence of this enormous dynamic range and the high fraction of non-detections, the HI mass fraction shows no clear correlation with parameters tracing star formation, structure, or morphology. Our FAST sample shows remarkable similarity to the $ATLAS^{3D}$ sample which only includes early-type galaxies, both in its high fraction of HI-poor galaxies and its high satellite fraction among HI-poor galaxies, as indicated by three different environmental characteristics: projected cross-correlation functions, background-subtracted neighbour counts, and central/satellite classification in the SDSS galaxy group catalog. These results suggest that while early-type morphology and environment play crucial roles in suppressing HI reservoirs, neither factor alone fully explains the observed gas depletion, indicating that additional physical mechanisms must be responsible for the extreme HI deficiency prevalent in massive quiescent galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Some compact stars may contain deconfined quark matter, forming hybrid stars or quark stars. If the quark matter forms an inhomogeneous condensate in the crystalline color superconducting phase, its rigidity may be high enough to noticeably alter the stellar properties. In this paper, we investigate whether these elastic stars follow the universal relations, i.e., relations insensitive to equations of state, that have been well established for fluid stars. We improve upon previous studies by allowing quark matter in the background, static, and spherically symmetric configuration to be sheared. Such background shear can be treated in the form of an effective pressure anisotropy. We then calculate the moment of inertia $I$, tidal deformability ${\lambda}_2$, and spin-induced quadrupole moment $Q$ of these models with pressure anisotropy. The $I$-${\lambda}_2$-$Q$ universal relations for the elastic hybrid (quark) star models are valid up to a variation of $\approx2\,(3)\%$, larger than that for typical fluid star models, when the maximal magnitude of quark matter shear modulus is considered in the crystalline color superconducting phase from realistic calculations. The uncertainty in universal relations related to the stellar compactness for these elastic star models, on the other hand, remain comparable to those for typical fluid star models. Our results demonstrate the validity of universal relations for hybrid stars and quark stars with a realistic degree of pressure anisotropy due to the crystalline color superconducting quark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiplicity is ubiquitous among massive stars. While the stellar components usually display similar masses, some binaries with extremely low mass ratios were also observed. Some of them are primordial, while others arise from binary interactions. The identification of systems with extreme mass ratios brings valuable information, notably on the origin of fast rotation in massive stars. We identify new short-period systems with extreme mass ratios through the detection of eclipses and reflection effects. The physical properties of a dozen newly identified cases were precisely evaluated through high-quality photometry and spectroscopy. In addition to characterizing these binaries, we found a clear signature of apsidal motion in one system, and three other systems display long-term shifts in eclipse times. All systems we reported here are composed of a massive star and a cool low-mass companion. They are therefore primordial cases. This doubles the known number of these systems in the Galaxy. In this context, it is important to note that most massive stars in these systems, as well as in previous systems reported in the literature, rotate fast (supersynchronous compared to the orbital motion). The high incidence of fast rotation in these nascent binaries provides strong constraints for star formation models.
#### The effect of near-surface winds on surface temperature and dust transport on Venus

 - **Abstract**
 The knowledge of the Venus near-surface atmosphere is sparse. Few spacecrafts landed on the surface and measured winds with amplitudes below 1 m/s. The diurnal cycle of the wind amplitude and orientation is not known. Recent numerical simulations showed that slope winds along topographic structures could strongly impact the direction of winds. This study presents the first mesoscale modelling of such winds on Venus. A change of direction is occurring during the day in the main slopes, with upslope winds at noon due to solar heating and downslope winds at night. This is due to efficient IR cooling of the surface during the night, being colder than its surroundings slope atmospheric environment and leading to displacement of air. The temperature is impacted by the adiabatic cooling/warming induced by those winds. A strong heating effect is occurring for the downslope winds, leading to an anti-correlation between the surface temperature diurnal amplitude and the topography. This diurnal amplitude reaches 4 K in the plains and below 1 K in the mountains. The saltation of sediment by those winds was also quantified, with a higher probability at night along the slopes on the western flanks.

 - **Abstract**
 Volcanism on Venus has never been directly observed, but several measurements indicate present-day activity. Volcanism could potentially play a role in climatic processes on Venus, especially in the sulfur cycle like on Earth. Observation of volcanic activity is the primary objective of future Venus spacecraft. However, there are many unknowns regarding its Venusian characteristics, like the condition at the vent, the volatile content and composition. Past modelling efforts have only studied explosive volcanic plume propagation over a limited range of flow parameters at the vent and in an idealised Venus atmospheric configuration. We propose to use the 1D FPLUME volcanic plume model in a realistic Venusian environment. In similar Venusian conditions, the height of the plume is consistent with past modelling. The present study shows that explosive volcanism would preferably reach 15 km of altitude. Under certain conditions, plumes are able to reach the VenSpec-H tropospheric altitude range of observations and even the 45 km cloud floor. For the first time, the impact of wind was quantified, and the super-rotating winds have a substantial impact by plume-bending of reducing the height of plumes. Contrary to the Earth, the atmospheric heat capacity depends greatly on temperature, and will disadvantage lower plumes and allow larger plumes to propagate at higher altitudes. The high latitude atmospheric environment, due to the thermal profile and weaker winds, is favorable to plumes reaching higher altitudes.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Cygnus OB2, in the Cygnus X complex -- one of the most active star-forming regions of the Galaxy -- hosts hundreds of O- and B-type stars at different evolutionary stages. This association provides a unique laboratory to study massive star evolution and dynamics. However, despite extensive studies, the absence of a fast-rotating group ($v\sin{i}>200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) among the O-type population of Cygnus OB2 challenges current models of massive star evolution. Aims. Stellar rotation strongly impacts spectral line shapes of O-type stars, and high rotation can potentially lead to misclassifications. We investigate whether some stars in Cygnus OB2, classified at low spectral resolution as B0, are actually rapidly rotating late-O types. Such cases could explain the observed lack of fast rotators in Cygnus OB2. Methods. Accounting for rotation, we reclassify the known B0 population in Cygnus OB2, using the MGB tool and both new and pre-existing optical spectroscopy. Finally, we compute projected rotational velocities using iacob-broad. Results. About $19\,\%$ of the initial B0 population in Cygnus OB2 are, in fact, late-O types. Only 6 stars in the entire dataset show $v\sin{i}>200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, with just 1 new O-type star exceeding this threshold. Conclusions. In our study of Cygnus OB2, we continue to find a notable lack of fast rotators among its O-type population. We propose a combination of three factors as the most likely explanation: (i) the young age of Cygnus OB2 may imply that fast rotators has not been produced yet due to binary interactions; (ii) fast rotators may have been dynamically ejected from the core as runaway stars; (iii) local star formation conditions may hinder binary formation (reducing spin-up interactions) or result in slower rotational velocities at birth.
#### Molecular line emission from 1000 au scales outflows to <30 au compact structures in NGC1333 IRAS4A2

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Studying protostellar objects in their earliest stages, particularly during the Class 0 phase, provides key insight into the beginnings of planet formation and dust evolution. Disentangling the various components, however, is particularly challenging. High spatial and spectral resolution observations of molecular line emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are therefore crucial for probing their complex environments. Methods. In this work, we present high-resolution ($\sim$30 au) ALMA observations at 1.3 millimeters of the Class 0 protostellar system IRAS4A2. Results. We detected large, well-traced outflows in HCN (3-2), H$_{2}$CO$(2_{1~2}-1_{1~1})$, and HCO$^{+}$ (3-2), along with numerous complex organic molecules (COMs) tracing central, more compact regions. Using moment maps, we analyzed the kinematics and spatial distributions of the molecular emission, revealing a wide range of spatial scales, from compact structures within the IRAS4A2 core at $\sim$8 au in radius, to extended $\sim$5000 au outflow emission. Specifically, we find that CH$_{3}$CDO and CH$_{3}$OCHO could be both good tracers of the disk, possibly tracing its rotation. Lines of OCS (22-21), SO$_{2}~(13_{3~11}-13_{2~12})$, HCN, H$_{2}$CO, and HCO$^{+}$, show more extended structures around IRAS4A2, likely tracing the envelope, disk, accretion shocks, the base of an outflow, and the outflow itself. Conclusions. Most COMs appear to trace distinct inner regions near the central protostar, while other molecules trace more extended structures, such as the envelope or outflows. The kinematics, emission patterns, and position-velocity diagrams suggest that individual molecules trace multiple components simultaneously, making it challenging to disentangle their true origins. Altogether, these findings highlight the complex spatial distribution within the IRAS4A2 system. Abridged.

 - **Abstract**
 The question of whether genuinely young high-$\alpha$ stars exist has been discussed for over a decade since their discovery from asteroseismology of giant stars as it is challenging to break the degeneracy between the binary interaction and the genuinely young scenarios. Young high-$\alpha$ stars are hard to explain with traditional chemical evolution model as the high-$\alpha$ disk is typically associated with the early epoch of star formation in the Milky Way. Combined with recent advances of gyrochronology, and that $^7$Li can serve as an unambiguous indicator for identifying merger products in dwarfs thanks to its low burning temperature, we identified young high-$\alpha$ dwarf candidate stars through their fast rotation in a previous study. In this paper, we performed high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of these candidates using Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI), and confirm 3 additional stars that are most likely genuinely young. Together with the star from the earlier paper, we find three out of four of them center around [Fe/H]=-0.5 dex, are ~5 Gyr old, and have a similar amount of elevated Li (~0.5 dex) and Al (~0.1 dex) compared to stars with matching $\log g$, $T_{\rm eff}$, Mg, and Fe within observational uncertainties, hinting at their common formation pathway.
#### Glycolaldehyde and ethanol toward the L1157 outflow: resolved images and constraints on glycolaldehyde formation

 - **Abstract**
 Two main formation routes have been proposed for interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs): on dust grain surfaces and in the gas phase. Observing such molecules in protostellar outflow shock regions - provided that their ages are well-constrained - can help distinguish between these pathways by probing chemical evolution over time. This study focuses on the potential daughter-mother relationship of glycolaldehyde (CH$_2$OHCHO) and ethanol (C$_2$H$_5$OH), previously proposed in the literature. We test whether gas-phase reactions converting ethanol into glycolaldehyde derived in these works can explain the observed abundance of the latter in star-forming regions. We target the southern outflow of L1157, which hosts three shock regions, B0, B1 and B2, of increasing ages: about 900, 1500 and 2300 yr. We obtained high-resolution IRAM NOEMA maps of three lines of glycolaldehyde and one line of ethanol. We derived their abundances in the three shocks and used a pseudo time-dependent astrochemical model to simulate gas-phase and grain-surface formation scenarios for glycolaldehyde. Ethanol is assumed to form on grains and be released in the gas by shocks, where it is gradually converted into glycolaldehyde via the ethanol-tree reaction network. We present the first spatially resolved maps of glycolaldehyde and ethanol in the L1157 southern outflow, and more generally toward solar-like star forming regions. The abundance ratio [CH$_2$OHCHO]/[C$_2$H$_5$OH] increases from B1 to B2, consistent with model predictions. However, the model cannot reproduce all three shocked regions simultaneously, suggesting that one of the assumptions of our model, such as the same excitation temperature and grain composition in B0, B1 and B2, or gas temperature evolution, is wrong. Nonetheless, our modeling rules out the possibility that all the observed gaseous glycolaldehyde is a grain-surface product.
#### A merger within a merger: Chandra pinpoints the short GRB 230906A in a peculiar environment

 - **Abstract**
 We report the precise X-ray localization of GRB~230906A, a short duration ($T_{90}\sim$0.9 s) burst with no optical or radio counterpart. Deep imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope detects a faint galaxy (G$^\ast$; $F160W\simeq26$ AB mag) coincident with the sub-arcsecond X-ray position. Compared with standard GRB galaxies, its faintness, compact size and color would suggest a high redshift ($z\gtrsim$3) host. However, our observations also reveal the presence of a galaxy group at $z\!\sim$0.453, confirmed spectroscopically with VLT/MUSE, with clear signs of interactions and mergers among group members. The GRB and its putative host project onto an extended ($\approx$180 kpc) tidal tail emerging from the group's central galaxy. The probability of a chance alignment is small ($P_{cc}\!\lesssim\!4$\%), we thus argue that the GRB and its galaxy G$^*$ reside within the group. Their peculiar location along the tidal debris suggests that an enhanced burst of star formation, induced by the galaxy merger, might have formed the progenitor compact binary $\lesssim$700 Myr ago. The compact binary later evolved in a neutron star merger which produced GRB 230906A and injected $r$-process material into the surrounding circumgalactic medium.
