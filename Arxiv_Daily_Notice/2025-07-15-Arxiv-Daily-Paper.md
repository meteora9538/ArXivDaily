 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy simulations have come a long way from the early days of simple N-body calculations, which considered only gravitational interactions, to the complex, multi-physics models used today. Beginning with initial conditions representative of the Universe shortly after the Big Bang, these modern simulations integrate the relevant physical processes involved in galaxy formation, such as gravity, gas dynamics, cooling, star formation, and feedback, while accounting for cosmic expansion and structure formation. This review provides an introductory overview of cosmological galaxy simulations, outlining the essential components and methods used to model the formation and evolution of galaxies on the computer. It also discusses common steps in the post-processing analysis, essential for extracting physical insights from these numerical experiments, along with basic tests to assess simulation validity and accuracy. Looking forward, next-generation simulations aim to push resolution boundaries, incorporate additional physical processes, and improve the robustness of the numerical models, promising to lead to a deeper understanding of how galaxies emerged and evolved over cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the far-infrared (far-IR) incidence of X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) and non-AGN galaxies as a function of stellar mass (M$_*$), star formation rate (SFR), and specific black hole accretion rate ($\lambda_{\text{sBHAR}}$), using data from five extragalactic fields (COSMOS, XMM-LSS, Stripe82, ELAIS-S1, and CDFS-SWIRE). We construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from optical-to-far-IR photometry to derive host galaxy properties and assess AGN obscuration. X-ray absorption is quantified using the 4XMM-DR11s catalog. Our final sample includes 172,697 non-AGN galaxies (53% Herschel-detected) and 2,417 X-ray AGN (73% Herschel-detected), with $10 < log\,[M_*/M_\sun] < 12$ and $0 < z < 2$. X-ray AGN exhibit a relatively flat far-IR detection rate across stellar mass and specific SFR ($sSFR = SFR / M_*$), unlike non-AGN galaxies, where detection correlates strongly with SFR. Among AGN, far-IR detection declines with increasing $\lambda_{\text{sBHAR}}$, despite rising SFR. Our results suggest X-ray AGN are preferentially found in gas-rich environments, where star formation and black hole accretion coexist. Far-IR incidence remains high across all sSFR bins, supporting a scenario in which AGN feedback regulates, rather than abruptly quenches, star formation. Comparing AGN and non-AGN SFRs without separating Herschel-detected from non-detected sources introduces biases. Obscured AGN show ~10% higher far-IR detection rates than unobscured ones, yet at similar $\lambda_{\text{sBHAR}}$, unobscured AGN tend to have higher SFR. This may suggest obscured AGN inhabit dustier systems with moderate star formation contributing to the far-IR. Our findings support a regulatory AGN feedback mode operating over extended timescales in gas-rich galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the star formation histories (SFHs) of 983 early-type dwarf galaxies classified into five morphological subtypes, dS0, dE, dEbc, dSph, and dEbl,across six environments ranging from the field to rich clusters such as Ursa Major and Virgo. Using full spectral fitting of SDSS spectra with the starlight code, we derive detailed SFHs and chemical enrichment patterns. We find that SFHs are primarily shaped by morphology, with environment playing a secondary but non-negligible role. Red early-type dwarfs (dS0, dE, dSph) typically formed most of their stars early and quenched rapidly, whereas blue early-type dwarfs (dEbc, dEbl) exhibit extended or ongoing star formation and host extremely metal-poor stars, suggesting continued pristine gas accretion. Environmental dependence is clearest in low-mass systems: field galaxies often show prolonged SFHs and delayed enrichment, while Virgo Cluster galaxies tend to quench earlier and enrich more rapidly. Cumulative SFHs reinforce these trends, with dSph galaxies showing the earliest quenching and least environmental dependence, indicating a likely primordial origin. Metallicity evolution also varies with mass and environment, progressing most slowly in low-mass field galaxies and most rapidly in high-mass cluster galaxies. Our results highlight the combined influence of morphology, stellar mass, and environment on the evolutionary diversity of early-type dwarfs, and suggest that both internal processes (nature) and external conditions (nurture) are intricately linked in shaping their star formation and chemical enrichment histories.

 - **Abstract**
 We evaluate the feasibility of Bose-Einstein condensate stars (BECS) as models for the interior of neutron stars. BECS are compact objects composed of bosons, formed through the spin-parallel pairing of neutrons. Here, we utilize the astronomical data from GW170817, XMMU J173203.3-344518 (the lightest neutron star known), and a novel lower limit on neutron star core heat capacity to scrutinize the compatibility of BECS with these recent observations of neutron stars. Our specific focus is to constrain the values of the scattering length $a$, a parameter determining the strength of particle interactions in the model. Our analysis suggests that if the stars involved in GW170817 were BECSs, the scattering length of their constituent bosons should fall within the $4$ to $10$ fm range. Additionally, at a scattering length of $a\sim 3.1-4$ fm, stars with mass and radius characteristics akin to XMMU J173203.3-344518 are identified. Moreover, we find that the heat capacity depends of the mass and temperature of BECS, and surpasses the established lower bound for neutron star cores when $a>2-5$ fm. In summary, our results endorse BECS models with $a\sim 4$ fm, providing neutron star observables in robust agreement with diverse observations and contributing to the ongoing understanding of neutron star interiors.

 - **Abstract**
 Afterglows of GRBs are, in general, well described by the fireball model. Yet, deducing the full set of model parameters from observations without prior assumptions has been possible for only a handful of GRBs. With GROND, a 7-channel simultaneous optical and near-infrared imager at the 2.2m telescope of the Max-Planck Society at ESO/La Silla, a dedicated gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow observing program was performed between 2007 and 2016. Here, we combine GROND observations of four particularly well-sampled GRBs with public Swift/XRT data and partly own sub-mm and radio data to determine the basic fireball afterglow parameters. We find that all four bursts exploded into a wind environment. We are able to infer the evolution of the magnetic field strength from our data, and find evidence for its origin through shock amplification of the magnetic field of the circumburst medium.

 - **Abstract**
 The filamentary dark cloud complex in Norma reveals signs of active low-mass star formation including protostars, H-alpha emission line stars, Herbig Haro objects, and the eruptive FU Orionis-like star V346 Nor. We present results of the first pointed X-ray observations of the Norma dark cloud, focusing on the westernmost Sandqvist 187 region. Chandra detected 75 X-ray sources and a complementary XMM-Newton observation detected 92 sources within the Chandra field-of-view, of which 46 are cross-matched to Chandra, yielding 121 unique X-ray sources. We present a catalog of X-ray sources along with basic X-ray properties and candidate IR and optical counterparts. Existing near-IR photometry reveals several X-ray sources with color excesses as typical of young stars with disks. Gaia parallaxes single out foreground stars and X-ray sources with distances of 500 - 1000 pc that are probable cloud members. The known emission line stars Sz 136 and Sz 137 were detected but V346 Nor was not. Interestingly, the optical and IR counterparts of the brightest Chandra source are not known with certainty but the prime suspects are very faint. Thus, the nature of the object responsible for the bright X-ray emission remains speculative. The X-ray observations presented here will serve as a pathfinder for identifying and characterizing the young stellar population in the Norma dark cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 In the quest to understand the climates and atmospheres of exoplanets, 3D global climate models (GCMs) have become indispensable. The ability of GCMs to predict atmospheric conditions complements exoplanet observations, creating a feedback loop that enhances our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres and their environments. This paper discusses the capabilities of the Global Exoplanet Spectra (GlobES) module of the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG), which incorporates 3D atmospheric and surface information into spectral simulations, offering a free, accessible tool for the scientific community to study realistic planetary atmospheres. Through detailed case studies, including simulations of TRAPPIST1 b, TRAPPIST-1 e, and Earth around Sun, this paper demonstrates the use of GlobES and its effectiveness in simulating transit, emission and reflected spectra, thus supporting the ongoing development and refinement of observational strategies using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and future mission concept studies (e.g., Habitable Worlds Observatory [HWO]) in exoplanet research.

 - **Abstract**
 The hottest, most ionized, and fastest winds driven by accretion onto massive black holes have the potential to reshape their host galaxies. Calorimeter-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is the ideal tool to understand this feedback mode, as it enables accurate estimates of physical characteristics needed to determine the wind's kinetic power. We report on a photoionization analysis of five observations of the Seyfert-1.5 galaxy NGC 4151, obtained with XRISM/Resolve in 2023 and 2024. In the Fe K band, individual spectra require as many as six wind absorption components. Slow "warm absorbers" (WAs, $v_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 100 - 1000~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$), very fast outflows (VFOs, $v_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 10^3~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1} - 10^4~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$), and ultra-fast outflows (UFOs, $v_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 10^4~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1} - 10^5~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ or $0.033 - 0.33~c$) are detected simultaneously, and indicate a stratified, multiphase wind. Fast and variable emission components suggest that the wind is axially asymmetric. All of the wind components have mass flow rates comparable to or in excess of the mass accretion rate, though the slowest zones may be "failed" winds that do not escape. Two UFO components have kinetic luminosities that exceed the theoretical threshold of $L_{kin} \geq 0.5\% L_{Edd}$ necessary to strip the host bulge of gas and halt star formation, even after corrections for plausible filling factors. The bulk properties of the observed winds are consistent with magnetocentrifugal driving, where the density depends on radius as $n \propto r^{-1.5}$, but radiative driving and other mechanisms may also be important. Numerous complexities and variability require further analysis.
#### A Multi-frequency Study of the Candidate Double-Double Radio Galaxy J2349-0003 with a Possible Misalignment

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-frequency analysis of the candidate double-double radio galaxy (DDRG) J2349-0003, exhibiting a possible lobe misalignment. High-resolution uGMRT observations at Bands 3 and 4 reveal a complex radio morphology featuring a pair of inner and outer lobes, and the radio core, while the Band 5 image detects the core and the compact components. The positioning of both pairs of lobes with the central core supports its classification as a DDRG. Spectral age estimates for the inner and outer lobes indicate two distinct episodes of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity interspaced by a short quiescent phase. The possible compact steep spectrum nature of the core, together with its concave spectral curvature, suggests ongoing or recent jet activity, suggesting the possibility that J2349-0003 may be a candidate triple-double radio galaxy. With a projected linear size of 1.08 Mpc, J2349-0003 is classified as a giant radio galaxy (GRG), although its moderate radio power (~10^24 W/Hz) suggests a sparse surrounding environment. Arm-length (R_theta) and flux density ratios (R_S) indicates environmental influences on source symmetry. The observed lobe misalignment and the presence of nearby galaxies in the optical image suggest that merger-driven processes may have played a key role in shaping the source's evolution.
#### Investigating the Dainotti Relation in Gamma-Ray Bursts through Multipolar Electromagnetic Radiation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09292

 - **Abstract**
 The Dainotti relation empirically connects the isotropic plateau luminosity ($L_X$) in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) X-ray afterglows to the rest-frame time at which the plateau ends ($T_a^*$), enabling both the standardization of GRBs and their use as cosmological probes. However, the precise physical mechanisms underlying this correlation remain an active area of research. Although magnetars, highly magnetized neutron stars, have been proposed as central engines powering GRB afterglows, traditional dipole spin-down radiation models fail to account for the full diversity of observed behaviors. This limitation necessitates a more comprehensive framework. We propose that multipolar magnetic field emissions from magnetars offer a plausible explanation for the Dainotti relation. Unlike simple dipole fields, higher-order multipolar configurations enable more complex energy dissipation processes. The coexistence of multiple components can plausibly explain the range of afterglow decay indices found from a sample of 238 GRBs with plateau features from the Swift-XRT database up to the end of December 2024, the majority of which deviate from the dipolar prediction of $\alpha = -2$, and more crucially, the spin-down physics yields a link between $L_X$ and $T_a^*$ in a way that preserves the Dainotti correlation with a slope of $b = - 1$, independent of the specific multipole order. Moreover, we find that the inclusion of higher order multipoles can explain the range of plateau energies found in the Dainotti relations. Thus, a unified picture emerges in which multipolar fields are able to reproduce both the slope and the normalization of the correlation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the main-sequence binary (MSMS) Catalog derived from Gaia Data Release 3 BP/RP (XP) spectra. Leveraging the vast sample of low-resolution Gaia XP spectra, we develop a forward modeling approach that maps stellar mass and photometric metallicity to XP spectra using a neural network. Our methodology identifies binary systems through statistical comparison of single- and binary-star model fits, enabling detection of binaries with mass ratios between 0.4 and 1.0 and flux ratios larger than 0.1. From an initial sample of 35 million stars within 1 kpc, we identify 14 million binary candidates and define a high-confidence "golden sample" of 1 million binary systems. This large, homogeneous sample enables detailed statistical analysis of binary properties across diverse Galactic environments, providing new insights into binary star formation and evolution. In addition, the $\chi^2$ comparison allows us to distinguish stars with luminous companions from single stars or binaries with dark companions, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars and black hole candidates, improving our understanding of compact object populations.
#### Application of interpretable data-driven methods for the reconstruction of supernova neutrino energy spectra following fast neutrino flavor conversions

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos can experience fast flavor conversions (FFCs) in highly dense astrophysical environments, such as core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, potentially affecting energy transport and other processes. The simulation of fast flavor conversions under realistic astrophysical conditions requires substantial computational resources and involves significant analytical challenges. While machine learning methods like Multilayer Perceptrons have been used to accurately predict the asymptotic outcomes of FFCs, their 'black-box' nature limits the extraction of direct physical insight. To address this limitation, we employ two distinct interpretable machine learning frameworks-Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)-to derive physically insightful models from a FFC simulation dataset. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between predictive accuracy and model simplicity. The KANs demonstrates high fidelity in reconstructing post-conversion neutrino energy spectra, achieving accuracies of up to $90\%$. In contrast, SINDy uncovers a remarkably concise, low-rank set of governing equations, offering maximum interpretability but with lower predictive accuracy. Critically, by analyzing the interpretable model, we identify the number density of heavy-lepton neutrinos as the most dominant factor in the system's evolution. Ultimately, this work provides a methodological framework for interpretable machine learning that supports genuine data-driven physical discovery in astronomy and astrophysics, going beyond prediction alone.
#### Dynamical traction and black hole orbital migration

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09674

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the circumstances which allow a black hole to remain put at the galactic centre when the stellar core is anisotropic. We use N-body calculations to study the response of stellar orbit families embedded in a larger, isotropic isochrone (Hénon) background potential. When the BH orbits in an odd f[E,Lz] velocity distribution function, they transfer angular momentum to it. We call this dynamical traction: it takes place whenever the kinetic energy drawn from f[E,Lz] has an excess of streaming motion over its (isotropic) v-dispersion. For a dynamically cold disc, the outcome depends on both the orbit of the BH and that of a Jeans-unstable stellar sub-structures. When the stellar clumps have much binding energy, a BH may scatter off of them after they formed. In the process the BH may be dislodged from the centre and migrate outward due to dynamical traction. When the stellar clumps are less bound, they may still migrate to the centre where they either dissolve or merge with the BH. The final configuration is similar to a nuclear star cluster which may yet be moving at ~10 km/s wrt the barycentre. The angular momentum transferred to a BH by dynamical traction delays the migration to the galactic centre by several hundred million years. The efficiency of angular momentum transfer is a strong function of the fragmented (cold) state of the stellar space density. In a dynamically cold environment, a BH is removed from the central region through a two-stage orbital migration instability. A criterion against this instability is proposed in the form of a threshold in isotropic velocity dispersion compared to streaming motion. For a BH to settle at the heart of a galaxy on time-scales of ~ 300 Myr or less requires that a large fraction of Lz be dissipated, or, alternatively, that the BH grows in situ in an isotropic environment devoid of sub-structures.

 - **Abstract**
 The outer Galaxy presents a distinctive environment for investigating star formation. This study develops a novel approach to identify true cluster members based on unsupervised clustering using astrometry with significant uncertainties. As a proof of concept, we analyze three outer Galactic Young Stellar Object (YSO) clusters at different distances and densities within 65 < l < 265 degrees, each known to contain >100 members based on the Star Formation in Outer Galaxy catalog. The 618 YSO clusters in the SFOG dataset were based on 2-dimensional clustering. In this contribution, we apply the HDBSCAN* algorithm to the precise Gaia DR3 astrometry to assign YSO cluster membership. Monte Carlo simulation, coupled with HDBSCAN* (HDBSCAN-MC algorithm), addresses YSO astrometric uncertainties while 5-dimensional clustering. We introduce the Generation Of cLuster anD FIeld STar (GOLDFIST) simulation, to enable robust membership determination, performing an unsupervised clustering analysis in higher-dimensional feature space while accommodating measurement errors. In this study, we extended our approach to distant outer galaxy YSOs and clusters with larger astrometric uncertainties. The results include the discovery of new members in the previously identified clusters. We also analyze the known stars in the clusters and confirm their membership. The derived membership probabilities are included in the provided cluster catalogs. The more accurately predicted simulation distance estimates closely agree, within uncertainty limits, with the median distance estimates derived from Gaia data, and are compared with the kinematic distances from the WISE HII survey.

 - **Abstract**
 Nuclear rings are long-lived structures, allowing the molecular gas inside to become sufficiently dense to initiate star formation. This makes them a crucial element in the study of secular evolution. However, the morphology of nuclear rings, and their potential correlations with that of the galactic hosts, remains an open subject. We examine 52 star-forming nuclear rings from the Atlas of Images of NUclear Rings (AINUR) and correlate the overall galaxy morphology, in particular non-axisymmetric features, with the morphology of the nuclear ring. We define three different classes of nuclear rings: two-armed rings dominated by two dust lanes, twoarms+ rings crowded with secondary dust lanes in addition to the two main ones, and many-armed rings with multiple armlets of similar prevalence. We employ unsharp-masked Hubble Space Telescope images to study the structure of nuclear rings. We find that two-armed rings are more common in early-type grand design galaxies with strong bars. Twoarms+ rings are related to later-type and more weakly barred galaxies, both grand design and multi-armed. Lastly, many-armed rings are typically associated with later-type flocculent and multi-armed galaxies with the weakest bars. In addition, we examine the regions inside the nuclear rings and observe nuclear spirals in 28 galaxies ( 90 % of those galaxies for which the interior of the nuclear ring is resolved). We conclude that the global morphology of the host galaxy and, more precisely, the presence and properties of a bar play a fundamental role in determining the morphology of the nuclear ring and the nuclear region. We suggest that two-armed rings are associated with a 180deg structure forced by a strong bar, many-armed rings are associated with a very weak or absent 180deg structure, and twoarms+ rings are found in intermediate cases.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic reconnection and Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves may well be both playing a role in coronal heating. In this paper, we simulate reconnection in the corona as a response to the convergence of opposite-polarity magnetic sources at the base of the corona. A current sheet forms at a magnetic null and undergoes impulsive bursty reconnection which drives natural modes of oscillation of the current sheet by a process of symbiosis. These are leaky surface sausage modes which cause the length of the current sheet to oscillate. Interaction of the oscillations and reconnection outflows with the magnetic Y-points at the ends of the sheet acts as sources for magnetoacoustic waves. Fast-mode waves propagate outwards into the coronal environment, while slow-mode waves propagate along the separatrices extending from the ends of the current sheet. The periodicities for sausage oscillations of the current sheet, for the current sheet length, and for the propagating large-scale magnetoacoustic waves are all estimated to be approximately 91 s for the parameters of our experiment.
#### The Rosetta Stone Project. II. The correlation between SFE and L/M indicator for the evolutionary stages of star-forming clumps in post-processed RMHD simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The evolution of massive star-forming clumps that are progenitors of high-mass young stellar objects are often classified based on a variety of observational indicators ranging from near-IR to radio wavelengths. Among them, the ratio between the bolometric luminosity and the mass of their envelope, $L/M$, has been observationally diagnosed as a good indicator for the evolutionary classification of parsec-scale star-forming clumps in the Galaxy. Aims. We have developed the Rosetta Stone project$\unicode{x2013}$an end-to-end framework designed to enable an accurate comparison between simulations and observations for investigating the formation and evolution of massive clumps. In this study, we calibrate the $L/M$ indicator in relation to the star formation efficiency (SFE) and the clump age, as derived from our suite of simulations. Methods. We perform multi-wavelength radiative transfer post-processing of RMHD simulations of the collapse of star-forming clumps fragmenting into protostars. We generate synthetic observations to obtain far-infrared emission from $70$ to $500\ \mu$m, as was done in the Hi-GAL survey and at $24\ \mu$m in the MIPSGAL survey, which are then used to build the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and estimate the $L/M$ parameter. An additional $1.3$ mm wavelength in ALMA Band 6 has also been produced for the comparison with observational data. We have applied observational techniques, commonly employed by observers, to the synthetic data, in order to derive the corresponding physical parameters. Results. We find a correlation between $L/M$ and the SFE, with a power-law form $L/M\propto {\rm SFE}^{1.20^{+0.02}_{-0.03}}$. This correlation is independent of the mass of the clumps and the choice of initial conditions of the simulations in which they formed. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 Massive protoclusters at z~1.5-4, the peak of the cosmic star formation history, are key to understanding the formation mechanisms of massive galaxies in today's clusters. However, studies of protoclusters at these high redshifts remain limited, primarily due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous selection criteria. In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation of the star formation and cold gas properties of member galaxies of eight massive protoclusters in the COSMOS field, using the statistical and homogeneously selected sample from the Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE). Our analysis reveals a steep increase in the star formation rates per halo mass ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR} /M_{\rm halo}$) with redshifts in these intensively star-forming protoclusters, reaching values one to two orders of magnitude higher than those observed in the field at z>2. We further show that, instead of an enhancement of starbursts, this increase is largely driven by the concentration of massive and gas-rich star-forming galaxies in the protocluster cores. The member galaxies still generally follow the same star formation main sequence as in the field, with a moderate enhancement at the low mass end. Notably, the most massive protocluster galaxies ($M_{\rm halo}$>8$\times$10$^{10}$M$_\odot$) exhibit higher $f_{\rm gas}$ and $\tau_{\rm gas}$ than their field counterparts, while remaining on the star forming main sequence. These gas-rich, massive, and star-forming galaxies are predominantly concentrated in the protocluster cores and are likely progenitors of massive ellipticals in the center of today's clusters. These results suggest that the formation of massive galaxies in such environments is sustained by substantial gas reservoirs, which support persistent star formation and drive early mass assembly in forming cluster cores.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk provide dense environments to influence on the star formation, evolution, and migration. In AGN disks, pressure gradients and migration accelerations could create the anisotropy of the core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) when the massive stars explode at the end of their lives. In this study, we construct the equilibrium equations by considering the above two factors and then compute the light curves for three types of progenitor stars at different locations of AGN disks for the different supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, accretion efficiencies, explosion energies, and masses of ejecta. The results show that the migration acceleration has more significant effects on the anisotropic explosions than the pressure gradients of the AGN disks. The anisotropic luminosities are pronounced at large radii, and massive SMBHs would suppress the anisotropy and reduce the total luminosity.

 - **Abstract**
 A simple, fully connected neural network with a single hidden layer is used to estimate stellar masses for star-forming galaxies. The model is trained on broad-band photometry - from far-ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths - generated by the Semi-Analytic Model of galaxy formation (SHARK), along with derived colour indices. It accurately reproduces the known SHARK stellar masses with respective root-mean-square and median errors of only 0.085 and 0.1 dex over the three decades in stellar mass. Analysis of the trained network's parameters reveals several colour indices to be particularly effective predictors of stellar mass. In particular, the FUV - NUV colour emerges as a strong determinant, suggesting that the network has implicitly learned to account for attenuation effects in the ultraviolet bands, thereby increasing the diagnostic power of this index. Traditional methods such as spectral energy distribution fitting, though widely used, are often complex, computationally expensive, and sensitive to model assumptions and parameter degeneracies. In contrast, the neural network relies solely on easily obtained observables, enabling rapid and accurate stellar mass predictions at minimal computational cost. The model derives its predictions exclusively from patterns learned in the data, without any built-in physical assumptions (such as stellar initial mass function). These results demonstrate the utility of this study's machine learning approach in astrophysical parameter estimation and highlight its potential to complement conventional techniques in upcoming large galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The role of magnetic fields in the formation of dense filamentary structures in molecular clouds is critical for understanding the star formation process. The Snake filament in or close to the Pipe Nebula s neighboring, a prominent example of such structures, offers an ideal environment to study the interplay between magnetic fields and gas dynamics in the early stages of star formation. This study aims to investigate how magnetic fields influence the structure and dynamics of the Snake filament, using both polarization data and molecular line observations. Our goal is to understand the role of magnetic fields in shaping the filamentary structure and explore the kinematics within the filament. We conducted polarization observations in the optical and near-infrared bands using the 1.6 m and 60 cm telescopes at the Observatorio do Pico dos Dias/Laboratorio Nacional de Astrof\isica (OPD/LNA). Molecular line observations of the C18O and 13CO lines were obtained using the IRAM 30m telescope. We analyzed the data to characterize polarization and gas properties within the filament, with a focus on understanding the magnetic field orientation and its relationship with the filament s structure. Our findings reveal that the polarization vectors align with the filament s spine, indicating a magnetic field structure that is predominantly parallel to the filament at lower-density regions. A velocity gradient along the filament is observed in both C18O and 13CO lines, with C18O tracing the denser regions of the gas. The polarization efficiency decreases with increasing visual extinction, consistent with reduced grain alignment in higher-density regions. The filament s mass-to-length ratio is below the critical value required for gravitational collapse, indicating stability.

 - **Abstract**
 The ionospheric Pedersen and Hall conductances play an important role in understanding the exchanges of angular momentum, energy and matter between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere/thermosphere at Jupiter, modifying the composition and temperature of the planet. In the high latitude regions, these conductances are enhanced by the auroral electron precipitation. The effect of a broadband precipitating electron energy distribution, similar to the observed electron distributions through particle measurements, on the conductance values is investigated. The new values are compared to the ones obtained from previous studies, notably when considering a mono-energetic distribution. The broadband precipitating electron energy distribution is modeled by a kappa distribution, which is used as an input in an electron transport model that computes the density vertical profiles of ionospheric ions. The vertical profiles of the Pedersen and Hall conductivities are then evaluated assuming that the conductivities are mostly governed by the densities of H3+ and CH5+. Finally, the Pedersen and Hall conductances are computed by integrating the corresponding conductivities over altitude. The Pedersen and Hall conductances are globally higher when considering a broadband electron energy distribution rather than a mono-energetic distribution. In addition, the use of the direct outputs of an electron transport model rather than the analytical expression presented in Hiraki and Tao (2008) as well as a change in the electron collision cross-sections also have significant impacts on the conductance values. Comparison between our results and the ones deduced from the corotation enforcement theory suggests that either a physical mechanism limits the field-aligned currents or the auroral electrons precipitating in the atmosphere are also accelerated by processes not associated with the field-aligned currents.

 - **Abstract**
 Simulate the entire GRB dynamics since its production until the jet's break-out from the star envelope is computationally expensive. In this work, we aim to investigate jet production at the black hole horizon and its subsequent evolution beyond the envelope boundary. We perform 2.5-dimensional GRMHD simulations using, as initial conditions, remapped massive star progenitors previously evolved with a state-of-the-art stellar evolutionary codes. Specifically, we adopt the Wolf-Rayet star models 12TH and 16TI from the Woosley \& Heger framework, and we evolve our own Long GRB progenitor with the MESA code. A dipolar magnetic field is imposed, with variations in field strength to explore its influence. We find that the jets are magnetically dominated, with their thermal and kinetic components remaining comparable during propagation through the stellar envelope. The cocoon is thermally dominated in most cases. Jet launching is successful when the magnetic field has a dipolar configuration and spin $a=0.9$, in contrast, a hybrid magnetic field does not result in jet formation. We observe disk formation in cases without a magnetized jet, however, the formation of a well-defined funnel is not evident and the expansion of such wind does not break the star for longer times. Our simulations show that a collapsar launches a successful, relativistic jet only when a strong, large-scale dipolar field, driving a magnetically arrested disk. Such jets collimate, accelerate, and break out of progenitor stars in $1.5\lesssim t\lesssim3.5$ s, while weaker or non-magnetised flows stall inside the star. The resulting jets have luminosities of $L_{j}\sim10^{49}$--$10^{53}\,$erg\,s$^{-1}$ and the final energy structure reveals that magnetisation distribution and progenitor stratification as the key determinants of jet structure and success.

 - **Abstract**
 In the build-up of galactic discs gas infall is an important ingredient and it produces radial gas inflows as a physical consequence of angular momentum conservation, since the infalling gas on to the disc at a specific radius has lower angular momentum than the circular motions of the gas at the point of impact. NGC300 is a well studied isolated, bulge-less, and low-mass disc galaxy ideally suited for an investigation of galaxy evolution with radial gas inflows. To investigate the effects of radial gas inflows on the physical properties of NGC300, a chemical evolution model for NGC300 is constructed by assuming its disc builds up progressively by infalling of metall-free gas and outflowing of metal-enriched gas. Radial gas inflows are also considered in the model. Our model including the radial gas inflows and an inside-out disc formation scenario can simultaneously reproduce the present-day observed radial profiles of HI gas mass surface density, SFR surface density, sSFR, gas-phase and stellar metallicity. We find that, although the value of radial gas inflow velocity is as low as -0.1 km/s, the radial gas inflows steepen the present-day radial profiles of HI gas mass surface density, SFR surface density, and metallicity, but flatten the radial sSFR profile. Incorporating radial gas inflows significantly improves the agreement between our model predicted present-day sSFR profile and the observations of NGC300. It predicts a significant flattening of the metallicity gradient with cosmic time. We also find that the model predicted star formation has been more active recently, indicating that the radial gas inflows may be help to sustain star formation in local spirals, at least in NGC300.

 - **Abstract**
 Meteoroid entry into planetary atmospheres generates bow shocks, resulting in high-temperature gas conditions that drive chemical reactions. In this paper, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of meteoroid entry using the Athena++ code, coupled with chemistry calculations via Cantera to model the non-equilibrium chemistry triggered by atmospheric entry. Our aerodynamical simulations reveal the formation of complex shock structures, including secondary shock waves, which influence the thermodynamic evolution of the gas medium. By tracking thermodynamic parameters along streamlines, we analyze the effects of shock heating and subsequent expansion cooling on chemical reaction pathways. Our results demonstrate that chemical quenching occurs when the cooling timescale surpasses reaction rates, leading to the formation of distinct chemical products that deviate from equilibrium predictions. We show that the efficiency of molecular synthesis depends on the object\textquotesingle s size and velocity, influencing the composition of the post-entry gas mixture. Applying our model to Titan, we demonstrate that organic matter can be synthesized in the present environment of Titan. Also, we find that nitrogen, the dominant atmospheric component, remains stable, while water vapor is efficiently removed, a result inconsistent with equilibrium chemistry assumptions. Moreover, we compare our simulation results with laser experiments and find good agreement in chemical yields. Finally, we also evaluate the impact on Titan\textquotesingle s atmosphere as a whole, showing that meteoroid entry events could have played a significant role in supplying molecules such as HCN during early Titan\textquotesingle s history.

 - **Abstract**
 As the two Voyager spacecraft traveled beyond the heliosphere, they encountered a magnetic field environment that had never been observed before. Studies have attempted to characterize this new regime by examining the magnetic field intermittency. This is typically done by fitting the optimal kappa distribution function and interpreting its so-called q-statistics to characterize the magnetic field increments. Using this approach, recent findings concluded that beyond a certain distance, the magnetic field increments in the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) follow Gaussian statistics, unlike those both inside the heliosphere and in the region just beyond the widely accepted heliopause location, raising questions about the heliopause identification. This study explores this issue in detail by (1) optimizing the derivation of the distribution function, (2) examining whether and how the results depend on increment windows and time periods, and (3) determining the statistical behavior of the examined time series. Using magnetic field measurements from Voyager 1, we present two independent techniques and introduce a statistical framework to systematically analyze the distributions of magnetic field increments. Contrary to previous findings, we find that magnetic field increments in the VLISM do not follow a Gaussian distribution (k to infinity) and instead are in the non-Gaussian range of kappa values (3-7, when analyzed on a 30-day statistical period). We further demonstrate how erroneous, statistically induced results can arise that mimic Gaussian-like results when mixing different structures in such analyses. Our results show that Voyager 1 still travels in the intermittent magnetic field environment of the VLISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Isotopic ratios have been used as chemical diagnostics to investigate the origin of the material in the Solar System. We have determined the HCN, HNC, and N2H+ isotopic ratios and the chemical age in a large sample of 23 starless cores located in different environments. This work uses IRAM 30m data to constrain the D/H ratio of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ as well as the 14N/15N ratio of HCN and HNC. The observed abundances have been modeled using the chemical code DNAUTILUS 2.0. Deuterated compounds are detected in all of our sample cores, with average DNC/HNC, DCN/HCN, and N2D+/N2H+ values of 0.054$\pm$0.019, 0.036$\pm$0.033, and 0.15$\pm$0.11, respectively. The deuterium fractions (Dfrac) show a weak correlation with temperature and a large scatter that reflects that other factors such as core evolution could also play a significant role. Our chemical model is able to reproduce all the observed values with 0.2-0.3 Myr in Taurus and 0.3-0.5 Myr in Perseus and Orion. The 14N/15N isotopic ratio is found to be different between HCN/HC15N (430$\pm$120) and HNC/H15NC (296$\pm$64). We find no correlation between these ratios and the deuterium fractions, but we report a weak correlation with temperature. The Dfrac of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ can be used as evolutionary tracers of starless cores as long as the physical parameters are well constrained. The HCN/HC15N and HNC/H15NC ratios are not correlated with Dfrac, suggesting that the detected variations are not correlated with the core evolutionary stage. The average value of the HCN/HC15N ratio in our sample is significantly higher than the values measured in protostars and protoplanetary disks, possibly indicating that nitrogen fractionation processes are taking place during the protostellar phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new Chandra X-ray imaging spectroscopy of the compact galaxy group IC 2431, and compare with archival ultraviolet, optical, infrared, and radio images. IC 2431 is a starburst system containing three tidally-distorted disk galaxies. All three galaxies may have active nuclei. One galaxy is classified as an AGN based on its optical spectrum, a second is identified as a possible X-ray AGN based on the Chandra data, and the third galaxy may host a radio AGN. In optical images, a prominent dust lane crosses the southern galaxy, while Spitzer infrared images show a dusty bridge connecting the two brightest galaxies. Chandra maps reveal a massive (2 x 10^7 M(sun)) concentration of hot gas between these two galaxies, as well as several other knots of hot gas and non-thermal emission. The unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of the hot gas in IC 2431 is ~ 1 x 10^42 erg/s, which is enhanced by about a factor of four relative to the star formation rate, compared to other star-forming galaxies. In radio maps, a bright jet/ridge of radio continuum emission extends 4 kpc from one nucleus. We compare the properties of IC 2431 with those of other interacting galaxy systems, and discuss two different scenarios that may account for the peculiarities of IC 2431: ram pressure stripping of the interstellar medium during a head-on collision between two galaxies, or an AGN-powered radio jet that has been distorted by an interaction with interstellar gas during a tidal encounter between galaxies.

 Predictions for the acoustic attenuation coefficient and phase speed as functions of frequency and altitude in Saturn's atmosphere are presented and discussed. The pressure range considered in the study is 1 mbar to 1 bar, in windless and cloudless conditions. The atmospheric composition is represented by the major constituents, namely hydrogen (with its two spin isomers, ortho-H$_2$ and para-H$_2$) and helium. The H$_2$ and He concentrations are assumed constant with respect to altitude; however, non-uniform ortho- and para-H$_2$ profiles are considered. The acoustic wavenumber is obtained by incorporating a viscous, thermal, and internal molecular relaxation effects in a linearized fluid dynamics model. The ambient inputs are vertical profiles of the specific heats, shear viscosity, and thermal conductivity coefficients of the three-component (oH$_2$, pH$_2$, He) mixture, extracted at each pressure-temperature pair.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of galaxies with no elements such as Oxygen - formed by stars after Big Bang nucleosynthesis - is a key prediction of the cosmological model. Finding them would provide direct and transformative evidence of the formation of the first galaxies in extremely different conditions than those observed today. JWST has enabled the identification of galaxies all the way to cosmic times of a few hundred million years. However, no pristine "zero-metallicity" Population III galaxies have been identified so far. Here, we report the identification of an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift z = 5.725 ("AMORE6"), about one billion years after the Big Bang, observed near the critical line of a foreground galaxy cluster, and thus multiply imaged and magnified (mu = 39-78). Publicly available JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) spectra consistently detect H$\beta$ at both image positions, but [O III]4960,5008 remains undetected. This places a firm upper limit on its oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) < 6.0 (1 sigma), or < 0.20% of solar metallicity. AMORE6 is characterized by low stellar mass (5.6+0.2-0.1 x 10^5 Msun), very blue rest-frame UV spectral slope, and extremely compact morphology (effective radius re = 4.0+1.4-1.4 pc). These properties are consistent with massive star formation in a pristine or near-pristine environment. The finding of such an example at a relatively late time in cosmic history is surprising. However, regardless of cosmic epoch, the identification of a potentially pristine object is a key validation of the Big Bang model.

 - **Abstract**
 Through studying rotation curves, which depict how the velocity of the stars and gas changes with distance from the center of the galaxy, it has been confirmed that dark matter dominates galaxy's outer regions, as their rotation curve remains flat. However, recent studies of star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon have shown a decline in their rotation curve beyond a certain point, suggesting a decrease of the abundance of dark matter in galactic halos during earlier times. In this work, we investigate the influence of cosmological surface brightness dimming and loss of resolution on observations of rotation curves at cosmic noon. We used a sample of 19 Lyman Break Analogs at $z \approx 0.2$ and artificially redshifted them as if they were at $z \approx 2.2$. By comparing both rotation curves of the observed and mocked objects, we find that the asymmetry of the cosmic noon galaxies is smaller than that of the low-$z$ galaxies. In low-$z$ galaxies, asymmetry increases with radius and becomes relevant at the external parts, where mergers and interactions cause more disturbance in the galaxy's gravitational field. In contrast, cosmic-noon galaxies appear smoother, smaller, and suitable for dynamical modeling -- when in reality, they are not. The combined effects of the cosmological bias and loss of resolution lead us to the conclusion that caution should be exercised when using cosmic-noon rotation curves, as they might not accurately trace the gravitational potential of the galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Spiral galaxy disks are thought to exist in a quasi-stationary state, between fresh gas accretion from cosmic filaments and disk star formation, self-regulated through supernovae feedback. Our goal here is to quantify these processes and probe their efficiency. While star formation can be traced at 10 Myr time-scales through H$\alpha$ emission, the signature of OB stars, and at 100 Myr scale with UV emission, the gas surface density is traced by HI emission for the atomic phase. We choose to investigate feedback processes using fountain effects in M101, a nearby well-observed face-on galaxy. Face-on studies are very complementary to the more frequent edge-on observations of these fountains in the literature. We use high-resolution data from THINGS for the HI emission GALEX for UV, and SITELLE/SIGNALS IFU for the H$\alpha$ tracer. We have identified 20 new HI holes, in addition to the 52 holes found by Kamphuis in 1993. We study in more detail the nine holes satisfying strong criteria to be true fountain effects, compute their physical properties, and derive their energy balance. Only one small HI hole still contains H$\alpha$ and young stars inside, while the largest hole of 2.4 kpc and oldest age (94 Myr) is deprived of H$\alpha$ and UV. For face-on disks, the possibility to study simultaneously the HI shell morphology, the stellar association, and kinematic evidence is of primordial importance. In M101, we have quantified how stellar feedback is responsible for carving the observed cavities in the atomic gas disk, and how it can expel above the disk the neutral gas, which is then unavailable for star formation during up to 100 Myr.
