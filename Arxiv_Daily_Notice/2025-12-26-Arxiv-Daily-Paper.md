 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of near-infrared (NIR) emission-line properties, AGN diagnostics, and circumnuclear gas dynamics for 453 hard X-ray selected (14$-$195 keV) AGN from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) NIR Data Release 3 (DR3; $\langle z \rangle=0.036$, $z<1.0$). This dataset is the largest compilation of rest-frame NIR spectroscopic observations of hard-X-ray-selected AGN and includes the full DR2 sample. Observations were obtained with VLT X-shooter, a multiwavelength (0.3$-$2.5$\mu$m) spectrograph ($R$ = 4,000$-$18,000), using a $\geq 2 \sigma$ detection threshold, enabling broad analysis of emission features. We find that NIR coronal lines, particularly SiVI $\lambda1.964$, are more reliable tracers of AGN luminosity than optical [OIII], showing a tighter correlation with hard X-ray luminosity ($\sigma=0.25$dex) than [OIII] $\lambda5007$ ($\sigma=0.55$dex). Broad Paschen lines (Pa$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$) are detected in 12% of Seyfert 2 and 57% of Seyfert 1.9, consistent with previous hidden BLR studies. We introduce a refined NIR diagnostic diagram (FeII $\lambda1.257$$\mu$m/Pa$\beta$ and H$_2$ $\lambda 2.122$$\mu$m/Br$\gamma$) that effectively distinguishes AGN, star-forming, and composite sources even when contamination limits individual diagnostics or only upper limits are available. Additionally, we find a moderate correlation ($p \approx 7.4 \times 10^{-3}$) between hot molecular gas mass (traced by H$_2$ 2.121$\mu$m) and X-ray luminosity, while its relation with Eddington ratio is weaker. The hot-to-cold gas mass ratio spans four orders of magnitude, averaging $\sim 3 \times 10^{-7}$, indicating diverse molecular gas excitation processes likely driven by star formation and AGN feedback. Our results underscore the value of NIR spectroscopy in probing AGN activity, obscured BLRs, and the complex interactions between AGN and their circumnuclear environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Sulfur dioxide (SO$_2$) ice has been tentatively detected in protostellar envelopes, but its reliability as a solid-state sulfur reservoir remains unclear. We present new measurements of SO$_2$ ice from 6.8-8.5 $\mu$m toward four Class 0 protostars observed with JWST's Mid-Infrared (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer, as part of the COMs ORigin Investigated by the Next-generation Observatory in Space (CORINOS) program. The sample spans a luminosity range from 1 $L_\odot$ (B335, IRAS 15398-3359) to 10 $L_\odot$ (L483, Ser-emb~7). To assess continuum placement uncertainty in absorption spectra, we apply randomized polynomial fits over the restricted region. We fit laboratory spectra from the Leiden Ice Database for Astrochemistry (LIDA) using the open-source Python library Omnifit. We detect the 7.7 $\mu$m CH$_4$ band in all sources and find its column density robust to baseline choice, providing a reference for evaluating the weaker SO$_2$ feature on its blue shoulder and quantifying baseline-related uncertainty. Three SO$_2$ laboratory ices were tested: pure SO$_2$ ice yields 0.3-1.2% of volatile sulfur may be locked in SO$_2$ ice (lower and upper limits); CH$_3$OH:SO$_2$ ice gives 0.02-0.18%, but with lower quality fitting. The best-fitting H$_2$O:SO$_2$ ice yields 0.2-0.9%, which we consider the most realistic. These ranges define plausible bounds on SO$_2$ ice abundances in our sample. We find evidence for SO$_2$ in Ser-emb 7, L483, and IRAS 15398-3359, but emphasize the noisy spectrum of B335 prevents a definitive detection. Comparing SO$_2$ ice abundances across the different environments, we assess how conditions influence role of SO$_2$ as a potential sulfur reservoir and implications for the longstanding ``missing sulfur'' problem.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite the tremendous impact of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) on the field of cosmology, their underlying physics are still poorly understood. Studies have found an intriguing correlation between standardized Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities and host galaxy masses, commonly referred to as the "mass step". SNe Ia in massive galaxies appear systematically brighter than in lower-mass, star-forming hosts after standardization. However, previous analyses use host galaxy mass estimates derived largely from optical data alone and assume parametric forms for host star formation histories (SFHs), both of which are known to misestimate galaxy stellar masses. In this work, we re-examine the mass-step relation with a sample of SN Ia host galaxies complete in broadband optical (3000 Angstrom to 1 micron) and near-infrared (up to 1.8 micron) data, and in some cases including mid-infrared observations (up to 4.5 micron), using Prospector to derive nonparametric SFHs. We find that while the masses for these galaxies have indeed been underestimated, the overall trend in SN Ia luminosity versus host mass remains largely unchanged. We also uncover an environmental metallicity-dependent trend, in which low-metallicity galaxies (Z < -1 Zsol) may drive much of the observed SN Ia luminosity-mass correlation, suggesting that the chemical composition of the SN environment plays a central role in shaping the standardized brightness of SNe Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 Mid-infrared (mid-IR) observations are crucial for understanding galaxy evolution, tracing star formation, and active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity via dust emission. This work presents mid-IR galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) at $0.5 < z < 6$, derived from the JWST Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) program. We combine 8 MIRI bands ($5-25$ $\mu$m) of SMILES and archival 23-band HST+JWST NIRCam photometry to construct an extensive catalog containing 2,813 galaxies with sub-$\mu$Jy level completeness in the mid-IR. We obtain monochromatic (in 5.6, 7.7, 10, 12.8, 15, 18, 21, and 25.5 $\mu$m), $L_{\rm IR}$, and AGN LFs, with a limiting luminosity down to $10^{9.5}$ $L_\odot$ at $z=0.5-1.0$, $\sim10^{10.5}$ $L_\odot$ at $z=2.0-4.0$, and to $\sim10^{11}$ $L_\odot$ at $z=4.0-6.0$. With the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution of JWST, here we better constrain the faint-end slope and its evolution of the mid-IR LFs, quantifying the dusty cosmic star formation and black hole accretion histories out to $z \sim 5$. These results provide essential insights to refine our understanding of the obscured star formation and galaxy-AGN co-evolution over cosmic time.
#### The transport of angular momentum for massive stars I. Formation of slowly rotating WNE stars

 - **Abstract**
 The evolutionary scenario of early-type nitrogen-sequence Wolf-Rayet (WNE) stars predicts a slowly rotating subclass that typically forms after the red supergiant (RSG) phase. Their slow rotation rates are attributed to stellar winds that remove angular momentum transferred outward during core contraction. We incorporate improved prescriptions for internal gravity waves and the magnetic Tayler instability into single massive star evolution models. Our simulations successfully produce slowly rotating WNE stars and determine optimal parameters for both mechanisms ($A \ge 10$ for internal gravity waves (IGWs), $\alpha = 0.01$ for revised Tayler instability (TSF)). The results demonstrate that the efficiency of angular momentum transfer in massive stars is significantly enhanced compared to low-mass stars, both processes can self-consistently explain the slow rotation of WNE stars, confirming their efficiency in angular momentum redistribution and providing crucial theoretical support for the existence of this predicted stellar population.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we carry out a new spectral reanalysis of NuSTAR and Suzaku observations of the disk reflection spectra in the stellar-mass black hole X-ray binary Cyg~X-1. We compare three types of models: a broken power-law disk emissivity profile with no assumption about the coronal shape used in the previous work of the same observations, a compact lamppost corona, and an extended disk-like corona motivated by recent X-ray polarization results. Our goal is to measure the systematic uncertainties caused by the assumed geometry, with a focus on key parameters such as the black hole spin and the inclination of the inner accretion disk. We find that the disk-like corona gives a fit that is statistically similar to the broken power-law and lamppost models, but it leads to more physically reasonable results, such as a lower inclination angle of about $30^{\circ}$. By using a variable disk density model, we measure the disk density to be $n_{\rm e}\approx10^{20}$\,cm$^{-3}$, which is similar to earlier results. While the extended corona model infers a wider allowed parameter space for black hole spin and the inner radius of the disk-shaped coronal region, this reflects the additional physical freedom of the model. Even so, the disk-like corona remains a strong and physically well-motivated candidate for explaining the X-ray emission from Cyg~X-1.

 - **Abstract**
 The Zwicky Transient Facility Data Release 2 (ZTF DR2) includes a total of 3,628 Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), providing the largest and most complete sample of spectroscopically confirmed SNe~Ia at low redshift to date. In this paper, we present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of 124 subluminous SNe~Ia, the largest sample of spectroscopically classified subluminous SNe~Ia observed with a single instrument, comprising 87 91bg-like, 12 86G-like, 18 04gs-like, and 7 02es-like events. We complement the published DR2 SALT2 light-curve parameters with new parameters obtained using template-based fits from SNooPy. Expansion velocities and pseudo-equivalent widths pEW of key spectral features are measured using Spextractor, and spectral averages are constructed for each subluminous subtype, binned by phase. We also analyze the host galaxy environments, both global and local, in terms of $g - z$ color, stellar mass, and directional light radius $d_{DLR}$. We find that all subluminous SNe~Ia (except the 02es-like subtype) are intrinsically red. This is evident by separating extrinsic from intrinsic color components. Since SALT2 is not trained on subluminous SNe~Ia, it compensates for their redder colors by inflating the $c$ parameter, thus extending the luminosity-width relation to negative values of x1. As expected, all subluminous SNe~Ia fall within the Cool region of the Branch et al. (2006) diagram, with the exception of 02es-like events, which show lower Si II 5972 pEW values. All subluminous subtypes tend to occur in more massive, redder host galaxies, and in the reddest local environments. Notably, 91bg- and 86G-like SNe~Ia explode at significantly larger normalized galactocentric distances. Finally, we identify the $pEW$ of the blended Ti II+Si II+Mg II absorption feature at 4300~A, along with s_BV, as robust and sufficient indicators for subclassifying subluminous SNe~Ia.
#### Changes in R Leonis over Two Centuries: Period evolution and dust shell development

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21296

 - **Abstract**
 The AAVSO-based historical light curve of the oxygen-rich Mira variable R Leonis is used to determine and analyse the properties of the star's maxima and minima. The pulsation period is found to have shortened by about 3 days over the past two centuries. Superimposed on the mean period are clear modulations on timescales of approximately 35 and 98 years. The depths of extrema show non-random behaviour: minima in particular display strong similarity in depth over extended intervals, with a mean depth difference of 0.26 magnitude for adjacent minima compared to a 0.38 magnitude difference for random pairs. Depth coherence persists for up to about 43 years. Examination of extrema depths over the full observational history of the star reveals gradual long-term changes, consistent with evolution of the circumstellar dust environment.
#### Bar Formation in Disc Galaxies: Internal Kinematics and Environmental Influence in MaNGA Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We explore how the physical properties of disc galaxies relate to the presence of bars using data from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. By combining internal kinematical properties and environmental diagnostics, we find that barred galaxies are more frequently associated with centrally concentrated stellar mass distributions (within 1 and 2 effective radii) and exhibit lower values of the stellar angular momentum $\lambda_{Re}$. At fixed total stellar mass, barred galaxies exhibit: (i) higher stellar mass, and (ii) lower angular momentum, both in their inner regions than their unbarred counterparts. We find a bimodal dependence of the bar fraction on tidal interactions produced by the nearest neighbour. Specifically, the bar fraction peaks in the most isolated galaxies, where bars form unequivocally through internal secular processes, decreases at intermediate interaction strengths, and rises again in the strong interaction regime, likely reflecting the role of dense environments in sustaining or triggering bars. Our results suggest that internal gravitational instabilities are the primary driver of bar formation. External tidal perturbations play a secondary role, capable of triggering or enhancing bar formation in galaxies that are already internally predisposed. Our findings provide robust observational validation of theoretical bar formation and evolution models in galaxies.
