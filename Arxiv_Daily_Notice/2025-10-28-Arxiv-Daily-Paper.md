#### Metallicity regulates planet formation across all masses

 - **Abstract**
 The role of stellar metallicity in shaping planetary systems is central to our understanding of planet formation. While the core accretion paradigm is widely accepted as the dominant mechanism for forming low- and intermediate-mass planets, the origin of the most massive planets remains debated, with gravitational instability often invoked to explain their existence. In this study, we analyze the dependence of planet formation on metallicity using the total heavy-element mass fraction (Z), which is a proxy for the composition of the protoplanetary disk inferred from stellar photospheres. We show that even the most massive planets form preferentially in metal-rich environments. Z correlates not only with the presence of planets, but also with planetary system multiplicity and total planetary mass. The most massive planets are found in the most metal-rich environments, and, in agreement with core-accretion theory, only the upper end of the planetary mass distribution shows a clear positive correlation with metallicity. These findings suggest that the chemical enrichment of protoplanetary disks plays a central role in shaping the full spectrum of planetary masses.

 - **Abstract**
 The LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (LVK) Collaboration has detected numerous binary black hole mergers with properties that challenge standard binary evolution scenarios, such as component masses above the pair-instability gap and high spin magnitudes. Dense stellar environments such as globular clusters provide a natural channel for producing such systems through hierarchical mergers, where black hole remnants formed in earlier mergers are retained in the cluster and undergo successive mergers. However, gravitational-wave recoil kicks often eject merger remnants from typical globular clusters, which limits hierarchical growth. Massive clusters with deeper potential wells, such as those found in giant elliptical galaxies like M87, may overcome this barrier, but direct simulations of such massive globular clusters remains computationally challenging. In this study, we present a 10-million-body cluster simulation performed with the $\texttt{Cluster Monte Carlo}$ ($\texttt{CMC}$) code, referred to as $\texttt{colossus}$, which serves as a proxy for the most massive low-metallicity globular clusters observed in the local Universe. This simulation demonstrates that extended chains of hierarchical mergers can occur in massive globular clusters, producing black holes up to fifth generation with masses approaching $250\,M_\odot$, comparable to the most massive LVK events observed to date (e.g., GW231123). Combining the $\texttt{colossus}$ simulation with the previous $\texttt{CMC Cluster Catalog}$, we develop a framework to extrapolate binary black hole merger predictions for the thousands of globular clusters seen in the Virgo Supercluster.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent Gaia-based young stellar association surveys have revealed dozens of low-mass populations that have, until recently, been too small or sparse to detect. These populations represent a largely unstudied demographic with unknown origins, and their relative isolation may minimize gravitational disruptions that impact traceback, making them compelling targets for dynamical studies. In this paper, we survey 15 of these isolated young associations for the first time: Andromeda South (SCYA-97), Aquila East, Aries South (SCYA-104), Cassiopeia East (SCYA-43), Canis Major North, Leo Central (SCYA-2), Leo East (SCYA-3), Theia 72, Ophiuchus Southeast, Scutum North (SCYA-70), Taurus-Orion 1 (TOR1), Theia 78, Vulpecula East (UPK 88), SCYA-54, and SCYA-79. By combining Gaia astrometry and photometry with new ground-based spectroscopic measurements, we assess the membership of each population, search for substructure, analyze their demographics, and compute ages. We find that the smallest populations in our sample contain $<20$ $M_{\odot}$ of stellar mass, making them the smallest associations ever detected. Four host substantial substructure, including TOR1, where we discover TOR1B, a new 9 $M_{\odot}$ association with radial velocities inconsistent with an origin in the parent complex. Using PARSEC isochrones, we produce self-consistent ages for all populations supported by dynamical and lithium depletion ages, which range from 6.9 $\pm$ 0.5 Myr in TOR1 to 42.8 $\pm$ 2.4 in AndS. Our results provide the first detailed overview of the properties of these populations, characterizing a largely unknown category of young associations that may have an important role in tracing the processes that guide local star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations have uncovered a population of compact, high-redshift ($z>6$) galaxies exhibiting extreme nebular conditions and enhanced nitrogen abundances that challenge standard chemical evolution paradigms. We present a joint UV and optical abundance analysis using a new suite of $\texttt{Cloudy}$ photoionization models covering a wide density range ($n_e=10^2-10^9$ cm$^{-3}$), combined with HST and JWST spectroscopy for a sample of star-forming galaxies across $0.0\lesssim z \lesssim10.6$. We find that assuming uniform, low-density conditions ($n_e\sim10^2$ cm$^{-3}$) in high-density environments ($n_e\sim10^5$ cm$^{-3}$) can bias nebular diagnostics by overestimating $T_e$ (up to 1800 K), overpredicting $\log U$ (by $>1$ dex), and underestimating O/H (up to 0.67 dex), while only modestly inflating N/O. Therefore, robust abundance determinations at high-$z$ require a multi-phase density model. Using this model, we recalculate O/H and N/O abundances for our sample and present the first $\log U$ diagnostics and ICFs for high-ionization UV N lines. We find that the UV tracers systematically overestimate N/O by $\sim0.3-0.4$ dex relative to the optical benchmark. We find that N/O increases with redshift, correlating with both $n_e$ and star formation rate surface density ($\rm\Sigma_{SFR}$), suggesting that N/O is temporarily enhanced in compact, high-pressure environments. However, the $n_e$ evolution with $z$ is more gradual than the $(1+z)^3$ scaling of virial halo densities, suggesting that $n_e$evolution is shaped by both cosmological structure growth and baryonic processes. These trends point to prompt N/O enrichment potentially driven by very massive stars, with key implications for interpreting UV emission and determining reliable chemical abundances from JWST observations of the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the early Sun may have profoundly influenced the planetary atmospheres of early Solar System planets. Flaring young solar analogues serve as excellent proxies for probing the plasma environment of the young Sun, yet their CMEs remain poorly understood. Here we report the detection of multi-wavelength Doppler shifts in Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) and optical lines during a flare on the young solar analog EK Draconis. During and before a Carrington-class ($\sim$10$^{32}$ erg) flare, warm FUV lines ($\sim$10$^5$ K) exhibit blueshifted emission at 300-550 km s$^{-1}$, indicative of a warm eruption. 10 minutes later, the H$\alpha$ line shows slow (70 km s$^{-1}$), long-lasting ($\gtrsim$2 hrs) blueshifted absorptions, suggesting a cool ($\sim$10$^4$ K) filament eruption. This provides evidence of multi-temperature and multi-component nature of a stellar CME. If Carrington-class flares/CMEs occurred frequently on the young Sun, they may have cumulatively impacted the early Earth's magnetosphere and atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 We report results from a five-year (132-night) dedicated observational campaign targeting two nearby young solar-type stars, EK Draconis ($\sim$50-125 Myr age) and V889 Hercules ($\sim$30 Myr age), using the 3.8m Seimei Telescope and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The aim is to observationally constrain statistical properties of flaring radiation/heating as well as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), through high time-cadence H$\alpha$ spectroscopy. We obtained an unprecedented sample of 15 H$\alpha$ superflares, including two blueshifted absorption, two blueshifted emission, one redshifted emission, and nine line broadening events. We obtain the following results: (1) Larger flares exhibit broader H$\alpha$ line widths, up to 14.1$_{\pm 2.4}$ Å, indicating higher chromospheric heating than solar flares. (2) The long-lasting redshifted event at $\sim$100 km s$^{-1}$ may indicate dense post-flare loops. (3) H$\alpha$ blueshifted absorptions/emissions provide evidence of massive filament/prominence eruptions, the core structures of CMEs. One newly identified event showed an unexpected rapid decrease in velocity. (4) The lower limit of the CME/eruption association rate with superflares is 27$_{-16}^{+25}$%, yielding occurrence rates of 0.21$_{\pm0.12}$ and $<$0.32$^{+0.46}_{-0.32}$ events per day for EK Draconis and V889 Hercules, respectively. (5) We derived the first direct estimate of the lower limit of the mass-loss rate driven by super-CMEs ($\gtrsim10^{33}$ erg) for EK Dra as $4 \times (10^{-13}$-$10^{-12})$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable to the stellar wind mass loss at a similar age. This study provides critical observational constraints on the radiation and plasma environment around young solar-type stars and the early Sun, which can drive planetary space weather and stellar mass/angular momentum loss.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries have revealed exoplanets orbiting young Sun-like stars, offering a window into the early solar system. These young stars frequently produce extreme magnetic explosions known as superflares, roughly once a day, potentially leading to fast and massive coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Recent research have highlighted the importance of stellar CMEs, as these events and associated particles can trigger atmospheric loss and initiate chemical reactions in planetary atmospheres. However, the observation of these associated CMEs remains largely unexplored, marking a crucial first step in assessing the particle environment. Here we present the results of 5-years multi-wavelength observations of young Sun-like stars, providing the critical clues to the common picture of solar and stellar CMEs. First, through optical spectroscopic observations, we found four of fifteen superflares are associated with fast prominence eruptions, precursors to CMEs. The stellar data greatly resemble solar counterparts, indicating a common picture of solar/stellar eruptions. Second, one of the eruptions is associated with potential coronal dimming in X-rays, indicating that the prominence eruptions evolved into stellar CMEs propagating through interplanetary space. Furthermore, the extension of solar MHD model supports the above indication and suggests that the eruption originates from the active region inferred by Zeeman Doppler Imaging and TESS light curve modeling. This comprehensive study suggests that further advancing the use of solar model could provide the first empirical inputs into calculations of atmospheric escape/chemical reactions for young planets.
#### A great diversity of spectral shapes in the ionising spectra of z ~ 0.6 - 1 galaxies revealed by HST/COS and possible detection of nebular LyC emission

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of eleven compact star-forming galaxies in the redshift range z = 0.6145 - 1.0053, with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We aim to spectroscopically measure for the first time the Lyman continuum (LyC) over a wider rest-frame wavelength range of ~ 600 - 900A compared to ~ 850 - 900A in previous studies of galaxies at z ~ 0.3 - 0.4. The HST data are supplemented by SDSS spectra of all galaxies and by a VLT/Xshooter spectrum of one galaxy, J0232+0025. These data are used to derive the spectral energy distribution in the entire UV and optical range, the stellar mass, and the chemical composition from the nebular emission lines. We detect stellar LyC emission in seven out of eleven galaxies with escape fractions, f_esc(LyC), in the range of ~ 2 - 60%, and establish upper limits for f_esc(LyC) in the remaining galaxies. We discover for the first time nebular LyC emission as a bump just bluewards of the LyC limit at 912A in two galaxies, J0232+0025 and J1021+0436. We find a similar bump among our earlier studies in a less distant galaxy J1243+4646 with z = 0.4317. We conclude that the use of the LyC continuum in the wavelength range close to the LyC limit, which contains both the stellar and nebular continua, requires special consideration to not overestimate the observed f_esc(LyC).

 - **Abstract**
 Enhanced star formation (SF) with star-forming neighboring galaxies bolsters hydrodynamical contributions during paired interactions. Although the relative spin orientation between interacting galaxies can influence this effect, it has not been comprehensively explored. In this study, using a curated sample of nearby (0.02 < z < 0.06) spiral-spiral pairs and an isolated control sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, coupled with Galaxy Zoo 2, and a method to estimate spin-spin alignment (SSA), we systematically compare the impact of the relative orientation, $\cos\xi$, on interaction-induced SF. We find that SSA is a key factor alongside the conventional parameters of projected separation and the SF of neighboring galaxies. The SF enhancement increases as configurations transition from perpendicular ($\cos\xi \sim 0$) to well aligned ($\cos\xi > 0.7$). The effect is strongest when neighboring galaxies have higher SF, indicating a hydrodynamical origin. The trend is consistent with increased hydrodynamical friction via stronger ram pressure and a higher likelihood of prograde orbits in well-aligned pairs.

 - **Abstract**
 Wide-angle tail (WAT) and narrow-angle tail (NAT) radio active galactic nuclei (RAGNs) are key tracers of dense environments in galaxy groups and clusters, yet no machine-learning classifier of bent RAGNs has been trained using both unlabeled data and purely visually inspected labels. We release the RGC Python package, which includes two newly preprocessed labeled datasets of 639 WATs and NATs derived from a publicly available catalog of visually inspected sources, along with a semi-supervised RGC model that leverages 20,000 unlabeled RAGNs. The two labeled datasets in RGC were preprocessed using PyBDSF which retains spurious sources, and Photutils which removes them. The RGC model integrates the self-supervised framework BYOL (Bootstrap YOur Latent) with the supervised E2CNN (E2-equivariant Convolutional Neural Network) to form a semi-supervised binary classifier. The RGC model, when trained and evaluated on a dataset devoid of spurious sources, reaches peak performance, attaining an accuracy of 88.88% along with F1-scores of 0.90 for WATs and 0.85 for NATs. The model's attention patterns amid class imbalance suggest that this work can serve as a stepping stone toward developing physics-informed foundation models capable of identifying a broad range of AGN physical properties.
#### SHELLQs-JWST: Revealing the Spectra of Extended Emission in 12 z > 6 Quasar Host Galaxies using the JWST NIRSpec Fixed Slit

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the rest frame optical JWST NIRSpec Fixed Slit spectra of extended host galaxy emission in 12 quasars from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) sample at redshifts 6.0 < z < 6.4. The spatial point spread function is modeled primarily by a sum of two Gaussians as a function of wavelength and is used to fit and subtract the quasar from the 2D spectra, leaving only extended galaxy emission which we analyze. Ten of 12 systems show spatially extended line emission and five of 12 systems show an extended stellar continuum. From the extended [OIII]5008 emission line, we measure a 132 ${\pm}$ 19 km/s ionized outflow in one system and 52 ${\pm}$ 12 km/s rotation, suggesting a coherent disk, in another. From the extended narrow H${\alpha}$ emission, which we hypothesize is ionized by star-forming regions rather than the quasar, we measure star formation rates ranging from ${\sim}$ 7 to 111 M${_\odot}$/yr, the majority of which are consistent with the star-forming main sequence at z ${\approx}$ 6. The positions of our host galaxies on the log10[OIII]5008/H${\beta}$ vs. log10[NII]6584/H${\alpha}$ (R3N2) Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram indicate ionization rates typical of AGN activity in the low-redshift universe, but are consistent with the placement of similar z ${\approx}$ 6 quasar host galaxies, suggesting that the R3N2 line ratios cannot distinguish AGN and star-formation powered line emission at high redshifts. We conclude from the consistency between our quasar host sample with z ${\sim}$ 6 galaxies that the presence of a low-luminosity AGN causes little significant change in the properties of galaxies at z ${\approx}$ 6 on 10 Myr timescales.
#### Probing AGN-ISM Feedback through Extended X-ray Emission in ESO 137-G034

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the X-ray emission of the Compton-thick (CT) AGN ESO 137-G034 based on deep ($\sim230$ ks) Chandra observations. As in other CT AGNs, the morphology of the emission is elongated, approximately following the [O III] ionization bicone. With spatially resolved spectral modeling, we show that the extended emission within the bi-cone regions { is most readily explained} as from a mixture of photo-ionized gas and shock-heated plasma, reflecting the combined effects of radiative and kinematic AGN feedback. By comparing the morphology of the { X-ray emission in narrow spectral bands and that of the 3 cm radio jet, we find suggestive evidence of thermal, possibly shocked emission associated with the SE termination of the radio jet. This interpretation is also supported by the lack of [O III] relative to the $0.3-3.0$ keV flux in the inner $3^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim600$ pc) of the SE cone, which would be consistent with an additional thermal X-ray component on top of the photonized emission of an outflowing wind. A similar effect is only seen within the inner $1^{\prime\prime}$ ($200$ pc) of the NW cone. In the radial profile of the [OIII]/X-ray flux ratio and the X-ray hardness ratio within the inner $\sim3^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim600$ pc) of the SE cone we see an asymmetry, with no counterpart in the NW cone. We detect soft extended X-ray emission in the cross-cones which may originate from the interaction of an embedded radio jet with a clumpy interstellar medium (ISM). }These results highlight the { importance of both} radiative and mechanical feedback in shaping the circumnuclear environment of ESO 137-G034.

 - **Abstract**
 Using a large observational sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we investigate the spatial alignment between galaxy pairs and their local cosmic filaments. Focusing on pairs with stellar masses and separations comparable to the Milky Way-Andromeda (MW-M31) system, we measure the angle between the pair connecting line and the orientation of the host filament, determined using a filament catalog constructed via the Bisous model. Our analysis reveals a statistically significant tendency of galaxy pairs to align their connecting lines along their host filaments, manifesting as an overall $\sim$7\% excess of alignment angles smaller than the MW-M31 case compared to a random distribution. Crucially, the strength of this alignment exhibits a strong dependence on the distance to the filament spine. Pairs located within 0.2 Mpc from the filament spine show the strongest alignment, while those beyond 1 Mpc display no significant alignment. Furthermore, we identify a bimodal distribution of alignment angles near filament cores, suggesting distinct dynamical populations potentially associated with infall and interaction processes. Our results provide robust observational support for theoretical models in which anisotropic accretion and tidal forces within the cosmic web drive galaxy pair evolution. They also position the MW-M31 system as a representative filament-aligned pair, offering insights into Local Group assembly. This study demonstrates the cosmic web's critical role in dictating pair orientations and motivates future work with kinematic data to unravel galaxy-environment interplay.

 - **Abstract**
 SDSSJ1539+3954 ($z\approx 1.935$), a radio-quiet weak-line quasar (WLQ), exhibited exceptional X-ray variability in 2019$-$2020, with its X-ray flux increasing by over 20 times from 2013 to 2019 and subsequently dropping by at least a factor of nine in 2020. Motivated by the empirical correlations between X-ray and radio emission in AGN cores, we carried out a follow-up radio study in the 0.3$-$10 GHz range using GMRT (2020, 2022, 2024) and VLA (2022), and analyzed archival VLASS 3 GHz data (2017-2023) to investigate the source's radio properties and potential connection with the X-ray behavior. Our observations reveal a compact radio source with a spectral index of -0.65$\pm$0.15 in the frequency range of 0.3$-$1.4 GHz and -1.09$\pm$0.16 in 3$-$10 GHz. While the source was undetected in VLA-FIRST (1994) and VLASS epochs, the GMRT and VLA observations show no statistically significant variability over the monitored period. The absence of detectable changes in the radio flux, despite strong X-ray variability, suggests no direct connection between the X-ray variability and the radio emission, consistent with the Thick-Disk plus Outflow (TDO) model for WLQs. However, the sensitivity limit of the surveys prevents us from drawing definitive conclusions regarding longer timescale variability between the VLA-FIRST and GMRT epochs. We further explore possible mechanisms driving the radio emission from this source. Our analysis rules out small-scale jets and coronal emission as the primary drivers of the radio emission, suggesting that extended emission from AGN winds and star formation is the more plausible mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding solar flares is critical for predicting space weather, as their activity shapes how the Sun influences Earth and its environment. The development of reliable forecasting methodologies of these events depends on robust flare catalogs, but current methods are limited to flare classification using integrated soft X-ray emission that are available only from Earth's perspective. This reduces accuracy in pinpointing the location and strength of farside flares and their connection to geoeffective events. In this work, we introduce a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based approach that translates Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) observations into soft x-ray flux while also setting the groundwork for estimating flare locations in the future. The model achieves accurate flux predictions across flare classes using quantitative metrics. This paves the way for EUV-based flare detection to be extended beyond Earth's line of sight, which allows for a more comprehensive and complete solar flare catalog.

 We presented the multi-wavelength afterglow fitting results for three events that exhibit late afterglow re-brightening behavior: EP240414a ($z=0.402$), GRB 240529A ($z=2.695$), and GRB 240218A ($z=6.782$), which span a broad range of redshifts, from the local to the high-redshift universe. We prove that the peculiar afterglow light curves of three bursts can be well fitted by structured jets propagated in free-to-shocked stellar wind environment of stellar wind blown bubbles. This scenario offers a self-consistent explanation for the observed subclass of afterglows that exhibit rebrightening that characterized by steep rises and rapid decays. It also provides a unified solution for such events and offers pathways to study both the jet generation mechanism and the propagation process of jets through the envelope of progenitor. This study reveals that the structured jets produced by such events exhibit a narrow jet core and a steep angle-dependent energy decay index, suggesting highly magnetized jets. The derived transition radii from free stellar winds to shocked stellar winds for all three events are smaller than 0.5 pc, with statistical analysis of similar events indicating a median value of 0.1 pc, which conflicts with numerical simulation results. We anticipate that future observations by EP/SVOM missions will enhance the understanding of analogous events and further reveil information about progenitors and the circum-environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of Green Bank Telescope (GBT) observations of two pulsars discovered with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) during the 19-beam Commensal Radio Astronomy FasT Survey (CRAFTS). We highlight the first timing solutions, pulse profiles, flux densities, and polarization measurements at 820 MHz for PSR J0535-0231, with a spin period of 415 ms, and PSR J1816-0518, with a spin period of 1.93 s, from a year-long follow-up campaign. PSR J0535-0231 appears to be partially recycled, but isolated, and likely belongs to the class of disrupted recycled pulsars (DRPs). We find that the two widely used electron density models, NE2001 and YMW16, both fall short of accurately modeling the line-of-sight to PSR J0535-0231, as the maximum dispersion measure (DM) predicted by both models is lower than the pulsar's DM of 117.6 pc cm$^{-3}$. Finally, we place both pulsar discoveries in the context of other FAST pulsars discovered in the CRAFTS survey and of the currently known pulsar population, in general, and discuss ways in which future FAST discoveries of faint, distant pulsars might facilitate the development of improved versions of the aforementioned electron density models in certain regions of our Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the possibility of determining the mechanism of the FU Orionis-type outburst based on molecular line observations of protoplanetary disks with synthetic observations of distinct numerical burst models. The morphology of the synthetic $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ emission is sensitive to gas temperature and does not coincide with the actual gas disk structures, particularly in the magnetorotational instability (MRI) and clump-infall models, which exhibit peculiar temperature distributions. This highlights the need for careful interpretation of morphologies of line emission from disks under accretion outbursts. The synthetic $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ emission of each model exhibits distinct kinematic features that can be used to distinguish outburst scenarios. In the MRI model, kinematic features of the gravitational instability (GI), which fuels MRI-driven accretion bursts, are small in both amplitude and spatial extent, resulting in no prominent local features in the residual velocity map at a typical distance for FU Orionis-type objects. In contrast, the clump-infall model shows a clear sign of gas expansion along a spiral, which is caused by exchange of angular momentum between an infalling clump and surrounding gas. The intruder model exhibits a highly asymmetric velocity structure with respect to the systemic velocity of the primary protostar in velocity channel maps. These distinct kinematic features may serve as promising diagnostics for distinguishing the physical mechanisms responsible for FU Orionis-type outbursts.
#### Revisiting the 150 MHz Radio Luminosity Function of Star-Forming Galaxies with LOFAR Deep Fields through a Refined Statistical Framework

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the 150~MHz radio luminosity function (LF) of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using deep observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey in the ELAIS-N1, Boötes, and Lockman Hole fields. Our sample comprises $\sim$56,000 SFGs over $0 < z < 5.7$. We first analyze the deepest field (ELAIS-N1), then jointly model all three fields while accounting for their distinct flux limits and selection functions. Using adaptive kernel density estimation (KDE), we reconstruct the LF continuously across redshift and luminosity without binning or parametric assumptions. The KDE results reveal clear signatures of joint luminosity and density evolution (LADE). Motivated by this, we construct and fit three parametric models--pure luminosity evolution (PLE) and two LADE variants--using a full maximum-likelihood method that includes completeness corrections and constraints from the local radio LF and Euclidean-normalized source counts (SCs). Model selection using Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria strongly favors LADE over PLE. For ELAIS-N1, the more flexible LADE model (Model C) provides the best fit, while for the combined fields, the simpler Model B balances fit quality and complexity more effectively. Both LADE models reproduce the observed LFs and SCs across luminosity and flux density ranges, whereas PLE underperforms. We also identify a mild excess at the bright end of the LF, likely due to residual AGN contamination. This study demonstrates that combining KDE with parametric modeling offers a robust framework for quantifying the evolving radio LF of SFGs, paving the way for future work with next-generation surveys like the SKA.

 - **Abstract**
 The morphology of ionized gas velocity maps provides a direct probe of the internal gas kinematics of galaxies. Using integral field spectroscopy from SDSS-IV MaNGA, we analyze a sample of 528 low-inclination, regular disk galaxies to investigate the correlations between velocity map morphology, star formation rate, and gas-phase metallicity. We quantify velocity map morphology using harmonic expansion and adopt two complementary diagnostics: the global kinematic asymmetry, which traces non-axisymmetric perturbations, and the first-order term ratio, which captures axisymmetric radial motions. We find that galaxies with higher kinematic asymmetry are more likely to deviate from the scaling relations, typically lying either above or below the star formation main sequence and systematically below the mass-metallicity relation. In contrast, the first-order term ratio shows only a correlation with gas-phase metallicity in the low-mass range and no significant dependence on star formation rate. Moreover, galaxies below the mass-metallicity relation generally exhibit higher HI gas fractions. These results suggest that external gas accretion is the primary driver of the observed phenomena: inflowing metal-poor gas increases velocity map asymmetry in disk galaxies, dilutes the metallicity, and triggers enhanced star formation. Feedback-driven outflows, bar- and spiral-driven inflows, and galaxy mergers may also contribute, but likely play a secondary role.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes in dense astrophysical environments, such as globular clusters or in the vicinity of other massive objects, may possess accelerations. Such acceleration would modulate the characteristics of the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in X-ray black hole binaries. In this paper, we explore the influence of spin-aligned acceleration of a black hole on QPOs observed in X-ray binaries. For this purpose, we compute the fundamental frequencies arising from the motion of test particles around an accelerating (spin-aligned) black hole and apply the relativistic precession, parametric resonance, and forced resonance models to establish their correspondence with several observed QPOs of X-ray binaries (GRO J1655-40, XTE J1550-564, XTE J1859+226, GRS 1915+105, H1743-322, M82~X-1, and Sgr~A$^{*}$). We then employ the Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method to constrain the black hole parameters. Our results show no evidence for spin-aligned acceleration in any of the analyzed sources, suggesting that most of these X-ray binaries reside in isolated environments and therefore experience only small perturbations to the background spacetime geometries.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The interplay between surface magnetic topology and chromospheric heating in active M dwarfs remains poorly constrained, limiting our understanding of their magnetic cycles and high-energy environments. Aims. We aim to test whether detailed Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) maps of AD Leo can be used to spatially anchor a multi-component chromospheric model and validate the link between magnetic flux distribution and emission-line formation. Methods. We analyze high-resolution CARMENES spectra of H-alpha and the Ca II infrared triplet, together with ZDI maps. Synthetic profiles are computed using the RH1.5D non-LTE radiative transfer code with two active atmospheric components (low-latitude near the equator and polar near the pole) and a quiet background. Their relative filling factors and temperature structures are optimized per epoch. The ZDI maps serve as qualitative references for the large-scale magnetic topology but are not used as input to the optimization. Results. Our model reproduces the spectral line profiles across multiple epochs. The low-latitude active region shows notable variability, accounting for approximately 55-86% of the emission, while the polar region remains relatively constant in area (12-17%) but exhibits temperature variations over time, particularly during periods of increased activity. The spatial locations of the active regions derived from spectroscopy agree well with the radial magnetic field distribution from ZDI. Conclusions. Combining spectroscopic modeling with magnetic field maps is an effective approach for mapping magneto-chromospheric structures in M dwarfs. This framework deepens our understanding of stellar magnetic cycles and chromospheric dynamics, paving the way for detailed time-resolved studies in active low-mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Very high energy (VHE) gama rays above 100 GeV are expected to undergo significant attenuation during cosmic propagation due to pair production with thr extralactic background light (EBL). However, recent observations - particulary the tentative detection of gamma ray burst GRB 221009A up to 18 TeV by LHASSO and up to 251 TeV by Carpet-2, challenge the predictions of classical EBL absorption models. These exceptionally high-energy photons suggest the possibility of new physics affecting photon propagation over cosmological distances. In this context, the gamma-ray spectrum in the tens to hundreds of TeV range serves as a valuable probe for potential Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) effects or for modifications to photon attenuation due to axion-like particles (ALPs) mixing with photons in cosmic magnetic fields. However, both LIV and ALPs explanations, when considered separately, face certain limitations in fully accounting for the observed transparency. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that combines the effects of ALPs and LIV to explain the unexpectedly high survival probability of VHE photons. Specifically, we investigate the multi-wavelength spectrum of GRB 221009A under this synergistic scenario, demonstrating that for photons at 18 TeV and 251 TeV, the combined influence of ALPs with coupling $g_{a\gamma} = 13.353 \times 10^{-11}\ \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and mass $m_a = 9.492 \times 10^{-7}\ \mathrm{eV}$, together with LIV characterized by energy scales $E_1 = 2.4~E_{\rm Planck}$ for $n = 1$ , can substantially enhance the photon survival probability. This synergy offers a compelling explanation for the observed VHE gamma-ray transparency in extreme astrophysical environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic winds are a key mechanism for angular momentum removal in young stars. In this work, we aim at characterizing the multi-component outflow of RU Lup. The unprecedented high resolution of the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) enabled a detailed study of the forbidden emission lines and the blueshifted absorption in the lines of the Na I and Ca II doublets, which we resolved in three discrete absorption components at low, medium, and high velocities. We developed a method that disentangles vertical and toroidal velocities in the absorption components and infers the wind launching radius, magnetic lever arm, and mass-loss rate. We identified a low-velocity broad component in the [O I] 5577 line, consistent with a rotating magnetohydrodynamic disk wind launched near the disk truncation radius. We showed that the discrete absorption components trace spatially and physically distinct regions of the outflow. The medium and low velocity components are launched from the inner disk (< 6.76 stellar radii) with low lever arms indicative of warm, highly mass-loaded streamlines. However, the two components differ mainly in vertical velocity. The low velocity absorption is consistent with an outer absorbing shell, while the medium velocity absorption forms near the disk truncation radius. Its higher vertical velocity is compatible with either a slightly larger lever arm, or additional heating at the base of the flow. For plausible ionization levels in the inner disk, this outflow component removes a substantial fraction of the accretion spin-up torque. In conclusion, our work shows that RU Lup hosts a stratified, rotating, warm disk wind launched across a narrow annulus near the disk truncation radius, which is sufficiently mass-loaded to extract a large amount of the stellar spin-up torque. The observations disfavor an X-wind scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 The Virgo cluster is one of the closest clusters to us where we can further study the evolution of galaxies, with several infalling substructures and several filaments around it have been reported. Therefore, it makes this cluster and its surrounding an interesting place to study the spatial distribution of the population of dwarf and bright giant galaxies. We analyse the dwarf fraction (DF) in different regions of the cluster, inside the virial radius, in its surrounding area, and in the filamentary structure surrounding it using available catalogues with the aim of measuring whether the DF changes in different environments. Although the total dwarf fraction within the cluster is $\sim$ 0.8, significant local variations are measured throughout the cluster; there are regions with a relatively higher concentration of giant or dwarf galaxies. The fact that Virgo is embedded in a rich environment surrounded by several filaments that feed the cluster with new substructures could imply changes in the DF locally. When we analyse the DF variation at further distances from the cluster we observe some regions with few or no giant galaxies at all, with a locally DF ranging from 0.8 - 1.0. Additionally, when comparing the dwarf fraction in different environments, overall, the DF is larger in regions further away from denser regions such as the Virgo cluster and its filamentary structure surrounding it. When comparing the filament and the cluster area, the dwarf fraction is slightly higher in the filaments, but from filament to filament, the DF changes depending on the presence of groups.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar rotation is a fundamental parameter in stellar studies. However, large homogeneous catalogues of rotational velocities derived from high-resolution stellar spectra are still lacking. The main objective of this work is to determine the line-broadening parameter (Vbroad), a proxy for the stellar rotational velocity, in a large sample of FGKM stars based on their ESO/FEROS spectra, previously parameterised by the AMBRE Project. Vbroad was estimated by cross-correlating the FEROS spectra with AMBRE binary masks. This methodology also relies on a specific calibration of a coupling constant between the rotational velocity and the width of the cross-correlation function. This fundamental step was performed by adopting the AMBRE grid of synthetic spectra. The derived Vbroad were then validated using data from the literature, ground-based spectroscopic surveys, and Gaia/RVS. After analysing more than 5,000 FEROS spectra (including repeated spectra for several stars), we obtained the line-broadening coefficients for 2,584 stars covering the FGKM spectral types, any stellar gravity, and metallicities between the metal-poor up to sub-solar regimes. The mean Vbroad relative uncertainty of this sample was found to be smaller than 8%. As expected, most stars were found to be slow rotators (below a few km/s), in particular, cool dwarfs and giants. However, several hot dwarfs and high-luminosity stars with high-Vbroad rates were identified, most of them not previously classified as fast rotators and/or affected by large macro-turbulent effects. The measured rotational broadening values are of high-quality and verified on the basis of literature comparisons. We publicly provide this catalogue of Vbroad parameters, including stellar atmospheric and quality parameters, for the analysed AMBRE/FEROS sources.
#### The influence of a stably stratified layer on the hydromagnetic waves in the Earth's core and their electromagnetic torques

 - **Abstract**
 Evidence from seismic studies, mineral physics, thermal evolution models and geomagnetic observations is inconclusive about the presence of a stably stratified layer at the top of the Earth's fluid outer core. Such a convectively stable layer could have a strong influence on the internal fluid waves propagating underneath the core-mantle boundary (CMB) that are used to probe the outermost region of the core through the wave interaction with the geomagnetic field and the rotation of the mantle. Here, we numerically investigate the effect of a top stable layer on the outer core fluid waves by calculating the eigenmodes in a neutrally stratified sphere permeated by a magnetic field with and without a top stable layer. We use a numerical model, assuming a flow with an m-fold azimuthal symmetry, that allows for radial motions across the lower boundary of the stable layer and angular momentum exchanges across the CMB through viscous and electromagnetic coupling. On interannual time-scales, we find torsional Alfvén waves that are only marginally affected by weak to moderate stratification strength in the outer layer. At decadal time-scales similarly weak stable layers promote the appearance of waves that propagate primarily within the stable layer itself and resemble Magneto-Archimedes-Coriolis (MAC) waves, even though they interact with the adiabatic fluid core below. These waves can exert viscous and electromagnetic torques on the mantle that are several orders of magnitude larger than those in the neutrally stratified case.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a suite of high-resolution simulations to study how different stellar feedback channels regulate the growth of central intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters (NSCs). We employ a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve the self-gravity radius of the $\alpha$-accretion disc ($<0.01$~pc) and follow the gas inflows from the interstellar medium (ISM) to the black hole (BH), allowing for the self-consistent emergence of circumnuclear discs (CNDs). In the absence of stellar feedback, as expected, the galactic disc fragments excessively, producing a massive CND. When radiative stellar feedback is included, fragmentation is suppressed, with even more massive CNDs forming and feeding the IMBH. With supernova (SN) feedback only, clustered SNe strongly heat the ISM, yielding both the lowest CND masses and BH accretion rates. When both radiative stellar feedback and SNe are included, the CND becomes intermittent: it survives for $10$--$100$~Myr, and is then destroyed by feedback before being replenished by fresh galactic inflows, while substantial BH growth still takes place. These results highlight the critical importance of accurately modelling the combined effects of key stellar feedback processes to understand IMBH growth. Our simulation suite brackets the likely range of CND states, with IMBHs exhibiting significant growth and systematic spin-up in all dwarf galaxy models explored. These findings bode well for the detection of IMBHs with future observational facilities such as SKA, the Rubin Observatory, and LISA, and make them highly relevant progenitor candidates of the high-redshift supermassive BHs observed by JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmic Vine is a massive protocluster at z=3.44 in the JWST CEERS field, offering an ideal laboratory for studying the early phases of cluster formation. Using the data from the DAWN JWST Archive, we conduct a comprehensive study on the large-scale structure, stellar mass function (SMF), quiescent members, and dark matter halos in the Cosmic Vine. First, we spectroscopically confirm 136 galaxies in the Vine at z=3.44, and an additional 47 galaxies belonging to a diffuse foreground structure at z=3.34 which we dub the Leaf. We identify four subgroups comprising the Cosmic Vine and two subgroups within the Leaf. Second, we identified 11 quiescent members with log(M*/Msun)=9.5-11.0, the largest sample of quiescent galaxies in overdense environments at z>3, which gives an enhanced quiescent galaxy number density 2x10^(-4)cMpc^(-3) that is three times above the field level at log(M*/Msun) > 10. Notably, these quiescent members form a tight red sequence on the color-magnitude diagram, making it one of the earliest red sequences known to date. Third, by constructing the SMFs for both star-forming and quiescent members, we find that both SMFs are top-heavy, with a significantly enhanced quiescent fraction at log(M*/Msun)>10.5 compared to field counterparts. The stellar mass-size analysis reveals that star-forming members are more compact at higher masses than their field counterparts. Finally, we estimate a halo mass of log(Mh/Msun)=13.2+-0.3 for the protocluster core, and log(Mh/Msun)=11.9-12.4 for satellite subgroups. The phase-space analysis indicates that three subgroups are likely infalling to the core. This work reveals a high abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster, demonstrating the accelerated assembly of massive galaxies in massive halos when the Universe was less than 2 billion years old.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a stack of data from the second season of the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder on the positions of quasars from eBOSS and DESI. COMAP is a Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) experiment targeting dense molecular gas via CO(1--0) emission at $z\sim3$. COMAP's Season 2 represents a $3\times$ increase in map-level sensitivity over the previous Early Science data release. We do not detect any CO emission in the stack, instead finding an upper limit of $10.0\times 10^{10}\ \mathrm{K\ km\ s^{-1}\ pc^2}$ at 95\% confidence within an $\sim 18\ \mathrm{cMpc}$ box. We compare this upper limit to models of the CO emission stacked on quasars and find a tentative ($\sim 3 \sigma$) tension between the limit and the brightest stack models after accounting for a suite of additional sources of experimental attenuation and uncertainty, including quasar velocity uncertainty, pipeline signal loss, cosmic variance, and interloper emission in the LIM data. The COMAP-eBOSS/DESI stack is primarily a measurement of the CO luminosity in the quasars' wider environment and is therefore potentially subject to environmental effects such as feedback. With our current simple models of the galaxy-halo connection, we are thus unable to confidently rule out any models of cosmic CO with the stack alone. Conversely, the stack's sensitivity to these large-scale environmental effects has the potential to make it a powerful tool for galaxy formation science, once we are able to constrain the average CO luminosity via the auto power spectrum (a key goal of COMAP).
