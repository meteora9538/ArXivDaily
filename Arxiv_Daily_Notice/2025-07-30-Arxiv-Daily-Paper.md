#### The CHIMERA Survey: The first CO detection in Leo T, the lowest mass known galaxy still hosting cold molecular gas

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first CO detection in Leo T, representing the most extreme observation of carbon monoxide molecules in the lowest stellar mass gas-rich dwarf galaxy ($M_{\star}$$\sim$10$^5$ M$_{\odot}$) known to date. We acquired and present new Atacama Compact Array (ACA) $^{12}$CO($J$=1-0) data within our CHIMERA Survey project for the central region of Leo~T, a metal-poor ([M/H]$\sim$-1.7) dwarf in the Milky Way (MW) outskirts. We identified three compact molecular clouds ($<13$ pc) with estimated upper limit virial masses of $M_{\rm mol}$$\sim$5$\times10^{3}$ M$_{\odot}$ each and a total of 1.4$\pm$0.4$\times$10$^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$, corresponding to $\sim\!3\%$ of the total gas mass. We obtained CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factors ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$) as high as $\sim$155 M$_{\odot}$ $({\rm K\, km\, s^{-1}\, pc^2})^{-1}$ and mean molecular gas surface densities of $\Sigma_{\rm mol}$$\sim$9 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ that are consistent with values found in dwarf galaxies with extremely low metal content. All CO clouds are shifted ($\sim$60 pc) from the stellar population centers, and only one cloud appears within the densest \hi region. Two clouds have velocity offsets with the \hi of $\Delta v_{\rm los}\sim\!+13$ km s$^{-1}$ being within twice the velocity dispersion ($\Delta v_{\rm los}/\sigma_{\rm HI,los}\sim2$) and probably bound. However, the northern cloud is faster ($\Delta v_{\rm los}\sim\!+57$ km s$^{-1}$); our models with low halo masses ($M_{\rm h}\! \lesssim \!10^9$ M$_{\odot}$) result in unbound orbits, suggesting that this material is likely being expelled from the dwarf, providing evidence for molecular gas depletion. These properties reveal a perturbed dynamics intertwined with star formation processes in low-mass dwarf galaxies, supporting a scenario of episodic bursts until they are fully quenched by the MW environment.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the Romulus25 cosmological simulation volume to study a large sample of late-type gas-rich galaxies with low central surface brightnesses known as classical low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies and compare them to a mass-matched sample of high surface brightness (HSB) galaxies. We find that classical LSB galaxies make up a substantial fraction of the galaxy population, accounting for ~60% of all central galaxies with 8$\leq$log$_\mathrm{10}$(M$_\star$/M$_\odot$)$\leq$10. In Romulus25, classical LSB galaxies are predominantly formed through major mergers in which the secondary galaxy is co-rotating and aligned with the primary galaxy's gas disk and/or has above average orbital angular momentum at infall. The merger product is a high spin galaxy in which star formation is spread out and inefficient, allowing the galaxy to build up a large supply of relatively unenriched gas. The star formation rates of LSB galaxies are nearly constant over time, leading to stellar populations that are, on average, slightly older and therefore optically redder than those of similar HSB galaxies. However, because LSB galaxies are diffuse and metal-poor, they have very little internal reddening, causing them to appear bluer than HSB galaxies. We also find that, when compared to the bulges of HSB galaxies, the bulges of LSB galaxies are similar in mass, but are lower surface brightness, redder, and more diffuse on average. Despite these differences, classical LSB galaxies are part of the continuum of the galaxy population in Romulus25, constituting one of many evolutionary paths.
#### Quenching Through Tidal Gas Removal: Molecular Gas and Star Formation in Tidal Tails of z ~ 0.7 Post-Starburst Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The active suppression of star formation in galaxies is critical in preventing the growth of overly massive systems and explaining the formation of present-day elliptical galaxies. We present a high-resolution, spatially-resolved multiwavelength study of two z ~ 0.7 massive post-starburst galaxies, SDSS J1448+1010 and SDSS J2258+2313, from the SQuIGGLE survey (Studying Quenching in Intermediate-z Galaxies: Gas, anguLar momentum, and Evolution), providing new insights into the role of mergers in driving quenching. ALMA CO(2-1) observations show that both galaxies removed ~50% of their molecular gas into extended tidal tails, spanning up to 65 kpc, following recent mergers. HST WFC3 imaging and grism spectroscopy show that while SDSS J1448+1010 exhibits Halpha emission in its northern tidal tail consistent with ongoing star formation, SDSS J2258+2313 lacks detectable star-forming activity outside the central galaxy. VLA 6 GHz continuum data reveal compact radio emission in SDSS J2258+2313, while SDSS J1448+1010 hosts small radio jets indicative of AGN activity. Both galaxies retain substantial molecular gas reservoirs in their central regions that appear more turbulent than 'normal' star-forming galaxies, likely contributing to the observed low star formation rates in the hosts. Despite similarities in their cold gas content and tidal features the galaxies are distinct from each other in their star formation, gas-star alignment, and radio morphology, highlighting the complexity of tidal gas removal as a quenching mechanism at intermediate redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new observations that densely sample the microwave (4-360 GHz) continuum spectra from eight young systems in the Taurus region. Multi-component, empirical model prescriptions were used to disentangle the contributions from their dust disks and other emission mechanisms. We found partially optically thick, free-free emission in all these systems, with positive spectral indices (median $\alpha_{\rm c} \approx 1$ at 10 GHz) and contributing 5-50% of the 43 GHz fluxes. There is no evidence for synchrotron or spinning dust grain emission contributions for these targets. The inferred dust disk spectra all show substantial curvature: their spectral indices decrease with frequency, from $\alpha_{\rm d} \approx 2.8$-4.0 around 43 GHz to 1.7-2.1 around 340 GHz. This curvature suggests that a substantial fraction of the (sub)millimeter ($\gtrsim$ 200 GHz) dust emission may be optically thick, and therefore the traditional metrics for estimating dust masses are flawed. Assuming the emission at lower frequencies (43 GHz) is optically thin, the local spectral indices and fluxes were used to constrain the disk-averaged dust properties and estimate corresponding dust masses. These masses are roughly an order of magnitude higher ($\approx 1000 \, M_\oplus$) than those found from the traditional approach based on (sub)millimeter fluxes. These findings emphasize the value of broad spectral coverage - particularly extending to lower frequencies ($\sim$cm-band) - for accurately interpreting dust disk emission; such observations may help reshape our perspective on the available mass budgets for planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the bolometric evolution of the exceptional Type Ic Supernova (SN) 2022jli, aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for its distinctive double-peaked light curve morphology, extended timescales, and the rapid, steep decline in luminosity observed at around 270 days after the SN discovery. We present a quantitative assessment of two leading models through hydrodynamic radiative simulations: two shells enriched with nickel and a combination of nickel and magnetar power. We explore the parameter space of a model in which the SN is powered by radioactive decay assuming a bimodal nickel distribution. While this setup can reproduce the early light curve properties, it faces problems to explain the prominent second peak. We therefore consider a hybrid scenario with a rapidly rotating magnetar as additional energy source. We find that the observed light curve morphology can be well reproduced by a model combining a magnetar engine and a double-layer $^{56}$Ni distribution. The best-fitting case consist of a magnetar with a spin period of $P\simeq 22$ ms and a bipolar magnetic field strength of $B\simeq 5\times 10^{14}$ G and a radioactive content with total nickel mass of 0.15 M$_\odot$, distributed across two distinct shells within a pre-SN structure of 11 M$_\odot$. To reproduce the abrupt drop in luminosity at $\sim 270$ d, the energy deposition from the magnetar must be rapidly and effectively switched off.
#### Preferential alignments of exoplanetary orbital planes in Milky Way spiral arms

 - **Abstract**
 Special orientations of the orbital planes may be reminiscent of the specific conditions that triggered and drove the star formation processes and how these are related to local and global Galactic kinematics. For a special sample of 66 extrasolar planets discovered with the microlensing method it is possible to determine the position angle of the planets in the sky relative to their hosts. We test the hypothesis that such orientations are randomly distributed against the possibility that the orbital planes follow some preferential alignment. We find that planets in the Scutum-Centaurus arm show a significant alignment with the Galactic plane, with an isotropic distribution disfavored by a factor of 10. Bulge planets and disk planets outside this major arm are instead compatible with isotropic distributions or show weak alternative preferences at most. Using the method proposed here, the future Roman microlensing survey will be able to identify and quantify preferential orientations in all structures from the Sun to the bulge with high confidence and accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered high luminosity galaxies that appear to be "too many" and "too massive" compared to predictions of the Standard LCDM cosmology, suggesting that star formation in the early universe is more rapid than previously anticipated. In this paper we examine in detail the following three effects which can instead provide alternative explanations for these observations: (1) a "top heavy" initial mass function (IMF) for the stars, (2) a variety of star formation histories (constant, exponentially decreasing, and peaked star formation rates), and (3) a variety of initial metallicities. Due to any of these three effects, galaxies of a given luminosity in JWST may be interpreted as having a larger stellar mass than they actually do. Our results are obtained using the Pegase stellar population code, and are presented as the ratio of the modified star formation efficiency relative to the fiducial one (which uses a Salpeter IMF and constant star formation rate). As an example, if the high-mass end of the IMF goes as $M^{-1.35}$, the star formation efficiency and inferred stellar galactic mass could be lower by a factor of $\sim 10$ than in the fiducial case. Our examination (keeping the star formation rate constant) of a top-heavy IMF with slope $\alpha$ leads to a simple relation that is a good approximation to the numerical results, $\epsilon(\alpha) \approx \epsilon_{\rm fid}e^{2.66(\alpha -2.35)}$. Since there are more low mass galaxies than high mass galaxies, these effects may result in a large number of seemingly overly massive galaxies compared to the expectations. Thus, the effects studied in this paper may explain both puzzling observations regarding high luminosity galaxies in JWST: the apparently overly massive galaxies as well as the profusion of apparently high mass galaxies.
#### Ultraviolet photon production rates of the first stars: Impact on the He II $λ$ 1640 Å emission line from primordial star clusters and the 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn

 - **Abstract**
 The first stars, the chemically pristine Population III, likely played an important role in heating the intergalactic medium during the epoch of cosmic dawn. The very high effective temperatures ($\sim 10^5$ K) predicted for the most massive Population III stars could also give rise to tell-tale signatures in the emission-line spectra of early star clusters or small galaxies dominated by such stars. Important quantities in modelling their observational signatures include their photon production rates at ultraviolet energies at which photons are able to ionize hydrogen and helium, dissociate molecular hydrogen and cause Lyman-$\alpha$ heating. Here, we model the spectral energy distributions of Population III stars to explore how these key quantities are affected by the initial mass and rotation of Population III stars given a wide range of models for the evolution of these stars. Our results indicate that rotating Population III stars that evolve to effective temperatures $\sim 2\times 10^5$ K could potentially give rise to a very strong HeII 1640 emission line in the spectra from primordial star clusters, without requiring stellar masses of $\gtrsim 100\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ indicated by previous models for non-rotating Population III stars. At the same time, the observable impact on 21-cm signatures from cosmic dawn and epoch of reionization from our set of rotating stars that evolve to $\sim 2\times 10^5$ K are modest, and produce potentially detectable features in the global 21-cm signal and 21-cm power spectrum for high Population III star formation efficiencies only.
#### Detecting Stellar Coronal Mass Ejections via Coronal Dimming in the Extreme Ultraviolet

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can strip planetary atmospheres, reducing the potential habitability of terrestrial planets. While flares have been observed for decades, stellar CMEs remain elusive. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emissions are sensitive to both flares and CME-induced coronal dimming. We assess the detectability of stellar CME-induced EUV dimming events by adapting a known "Sun-as-a-star" dimming technique -- validated by the Solar Dynamics Observatory's EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) -- to stellar conditions. We adapt the solar data to reflect a range of stellar intensities, accounting for intrinsic brightness, distance, and interstellar medium (ISM) attenuation. We generate synthetic light curves for two different missions: the legacy EUV Explorer (EUVE) and the proposed ESCAPE mission. Our results indicate that dimming detections are well within reach. EUVE's broadband imager was capable of detecting stellar CMEs -- albeit with limited spectral (temperature) resolution -- but that was not part of the observing plan. EUVE's spectroscopic survey lacked sufficient sensitivity for CME detections. Optimizing modern instrument design for this task would make the observation fully feasible. In this work, we present a tool to explore the stellar-CME detection parameter space. Our tool shows that an instrument with performance similar to ESCAPE, setting a 600-second integration period, and integrating the spectra into bands, any star with an X-ray flux $\geq 2.51 \times 10^{-12}$ergs$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$ should have a $\geq 3\sigma$ detection even for a modest few-percent dimming profile, regardless of ISM attenuation. Such measurements would be crucial for understanding the space weather environments of exoplanet host stars and, ultimately, for evaluating planetary habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence and magnetic fields are components of the interstellar medium and are interconnected through plasma processes. In particular, the magnetic flux transport in the presence of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is an essential factor for understanding star formation. The theory of Reconnection Diffusion (RD), based on statistics of Alfvénic turbulence, predicts a dependence of the diffusion coefficient of the magnetic field on the Alfvénic Mach number $M_A$. However, this theory does not consider the effects of compressibility which are important in the regime of supersonic MHD turbulence. In this work, we measure the diffusion coefficient of magnetic fields in sub-Alfvénic MHD turbulence, with different sonic Mach numbers $M_S$. We perform numerical simulations of forced turbulence in periodic domains from the incompressible limit to the supersonic regime. We introduce two methods to extract the diffusion coefficient, based on the analysis of tracer particles. Our results confirm the RD assumption regarding the correspondence between the diffusion of magnetic field and that of fluid Lagrangian particles. The measured diffusion rate provided by incompressible turbulence agrees with the suppression predicted by the RD theory in the presence of strong magnetic fields: $D \propto M_A^3$. Our simulations also indicate an increase in RD efficiency when the turbulence is compressible. The dependency on $M_A$ and $M_S$ from the simulations can be described by the relation $D \propto M_A^\alpha$, where $\alpha(M_S) \approx 3/(1 + M_S)$. This quantitative characterization of $D$ is critical for modeling star formation in turbulent molecular clouds and evaluating the efficiency of this transport compared to other mechanisms.
#### Radio Variability in Recently-Quenched Galaxies: The Impact of TDE or AGN Driven Outflows

 - **Abstract**
 Outflows and jets launched from the nuclei of galaxies emit radio synchrotron emission that can be used to study the impact of accretion energy on the host galaxy. The decades-long baseline now enabled by large radio surveys allows us to identify cases where new outflows or jets have been launched. Here, we present the results of a targeted VLA program observing four post-starburst galaxies that have brightened significantly in radio emission over the past ~20 years. We obtain quasi-simultaneous observations in five bands (1-18 GHz) for each source. We find peaked spectral energy distributions, indicative of self-absorbed synchrotron emission. While all four sources have risen significantly over the past ~20 years in the 1-2 GHz band, two also show clear recent flares in the 2-4 GHz band. These sources are less luminous than typical peaked spectrum radio AGN. It remains unclear whether these sources are low luminosity analogs of the peaked radio AGN from accreted gas, or driven by tidal disruption events with missed optical flares. Regardless of the source of the accreted material, these newly-launched outflows contain sufficient energy to drive the molecular gas outflows observed in post-starburst galaxies and to drive turbulence suppressing star formation.
#### Reprocessing of the Parkes 70-cm Survey and Discovery of a New Radio Pulsar in the Large Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 We have reprocessed the data archived from the Parkes 70-cm pulsar (PKS70) survey with an expanded DM search range and an acceleration search. Our goal was to detect pulsars that might have been missed in the original survey processing. Of the original 43842 pointings, 34869 pointings were archived, along with 440 additional pointings for confirmation or timing. We processed all of these archived data and detected 359 known pulsars: 265 of these were detected in the original survey, while an additional 94 currently known pulsars were detected in our reprocessing. A few among those 94 pulsars are highly accelerated binary pulsars. Furthermore, we detected 5 more pulsars with DMs higher than the original survey thresholds, as well as 6 more pulsars below the nominal survey sensitivity threshold (from the original survey beams with longer integrations). We missed detection of 33 (of the 298) pulsars detected in the original survey, in part because portions of the survey data were missing in the archive and our early stage candidate sifting method. We discovered one new pulsar in the re-analysis, PSR J0540$-$69 which has a spin period of 0.909 s and resides in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This new pulsar appeared in three PKS70 beams and one additional L-band observation that targeted the LMC pulsar PSR B0540$-$69. The numerous pulsar detections found in our re-analysis and the discovery of a new pulsar in the LMC highlight the value of conducting multiple searches through pulsar datasets.
#### Multi-frequency observations of PDS 70c: Radio emission mechanisms in the circum-planetary environment

 - **Abstract**
 PDS 70c is a source of Ha emission and variable sub-mm signal. Understanding its emission mechanisms may enable observations of accretion rates and physical conditions in the circum-planetary environment. We report ALMA observations of PDS 70 at 145 GHz (Band 4), 343.5 GHz (Band 7) and 671 GHz (Band 9) and compare with data at 97.5 GHz (Band 3), taken within two months. The radio spectrum (SED) is analyzed with analytic circumplanetary disk (CPD). In a novel approach we include the free-free continuum from HI, metals (e.g. KI) and H-. New detections in Bands 3 (tentative at 2.6sigma), 4 (5sigma), and 7 (re-detected at 9sigma) are consistent with optically thick thermal emission from PDS 70c (spectral index alpha 2+-0.2). However, a Band 9 non-detection lies 2.6sigma below an optically thick extrapolation. A viscous dusty disk is inconsistent with the data, even with the inclusion of ionised jets. Interestingly, the central temperatures in such CPD models are high enough to ionise HI, with huge emission measures and an optically thick spectrum that marginally accounts for the SED (within 3sigma of Band 9). By contrast, uniform-slab models suggest much lower emission measures to account for the Band 9 drop, with ionisation fractions ~1E-7 , and an outer radius of ~0.1au. Such conditions are recovered if the CPD interacts with a planetary magnetic field, leading to a radially variable viscosity alpha(R)<~1 and central temperatures ~1E3K that regulate metal ionisation. However, the H- opacity still results in an optically thick SED, overshooting Band 9. We find that the optically thin turnover at ~600GHz is only recovered if a thin shocked layer is present at the CPD surface, as suggested by simulations. A photospheric shock or accretion funnels are ruled out as radio emission sources because their small solid angles require T~1e6K, which are unrealistic planetary shock accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 Star-forming regions are essential for studying very young stellar objects of various masses. They still contain a significant amount of dust and gas. We present a study of light curves of stars in the field of the Chamaeleon I association. We use automatic spectral classification with MKCLASS to identify the spectral types of the stars in the field with a light curve from the NEOWISE and Gaia surveys. The light curves are analysed using the software Peranso and astropy. We also used VSX to identify the variability type. Based on astrometry, we have identified 92 stars, 73 of which are members of the association. We received light curves for 55 stars from the Gaia survey and for 69 stars from the ALLWISE/NEOWISE survey. For 28 of them, it was possible to determine the types of variables, mostly T Tauri and Orion variables. The spectral types of the members are mostly cooler M-type stars, with one being a possible chemically peculiar (CP) star. The non-members associated with light curve measurements include spectral types A-G with one CP candidate.

 - **Abstract**
 Strange quark stars (SQSs), namely compact stars entirely composed of deconfined quark matter, are characterized by similar masses and compactness to neutron stars (NSs) and have been theoretically proposed to exist in the Universe since the 1970s. However, multiwavelength observations of compact stars in the last 50 years have not yet led to an unambiguous SQS identification. This article explores whether SQSs could form in the supernova (SN) explosion of an evolved star (e.g., carbon-oxygen, or Wolf-Rayet) occurring in a binary with the companion being a neutron star (NS). The collapse of the iron core of the evolved star generates a newborn NS and the SN explosion. Part of the ejected matter accretes onto the NS companion as well as onto the newborn NS via matter fallback. The accretion occurs at hypercritical (highly super-Eddington) rates, transferring mass and angular momentum to the stars. We present numerical simulations of this scenario and demonstrate that the density increase in the NS interiors during the accretion process may induce quark matter deconfinement, suggesting the possibility of SQS formation. We discuss the astrophysical conditions under which such a transformation may occur and possible consequences.
