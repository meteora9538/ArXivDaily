 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the mass distribution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) over cosmic time remains particularly challenging for the low mass ($M_{\bullet}\lesssim10^8~M_\odot$) population at $z>1$. This population is also the most sensitive to SMBH seeding and early growth models. In this work we construct a semi-empirical model for the redshift evolution of the TDE rate under multiple SMBH mass function prescriptions, and show that the observed redshift-dependent rate of TDEs is very sensitive to the SMBH mass function and its evolution with redshift. We further incorporate galaxy-scale processes that evolve with redshift -- namely, increasing galaxy nuclear stellar densities, enhanced galaxy-galaxy merger rates, dust obscuration, and a possible top-heavy IMF at early cosmic times -- and quantify their combined impact on the TDE rate. We find that including these effects generally results in a volumetric TDE rate that increases with redshift until a maximum near cosmic noon, before declining at higher redshift where SMBHs that can disrupt stars become increasingly scarce. We forecast TDE rates in the Rubin LSST and the Roman High Latitude Time Domain Survey, alongside expectations for serendipitous TDE rates in the JWST COSMOS-Web survey. Finally, we provide a methodology for using a flux-limited survey of TDEs in LSST to directly constrain the redshift evolution of the SMBH mass function.

 - **Abstract**
 In both observed and simulated galaxies, disk morphologies become more prevalent at higher masses and lower redshifts. To elucidate the physical origin of this trend, we develop a simple analytical model in which galaxy morphology is governed by the competition between rotational support and turbulence in a gravitational potential of a dark matter halo and the galaxy itself, and a disk forms when the potential steepens due to the accumulation of baryons in the halo center. The minimum galaxy mass required for this transition decreases with an increasing dark matter contribution within the galaxy, making more concentrated halos more prone to forming disks. Our model predicts that galaxy sizes behave qualitatively differently before and after disk formation: after disks form, sizes are governed by the halo spin, in agreement with classical models, whereas before disk formation, sizes are larger and set by the scale on which turbulent motions, which dominate over rotation, can be contained. We validate our model against the results of the TNG50 cosmological simulation and, despite the simplicity of the model, find remarkable agreement. In particular, our model explains the increase with redshift in the critical halo mass for disk formation, reported in both simulations and observations, as a consequence of the evolution of the halo mass-concentration and baryonic mass-halo mass relations. This redshift trend therefore supports the recent proposal that it is the steepening of the gravitational potential that causes disk formation, while other effects discussed in the literature, such as potential deepening and hot gaseous halo formation, can still play important roles in the transition from early turbulent to dynamically cold disks.
#### Wiggling Through the ICM: Multi-Resolution Radio Imaging of a Tailed Radio Galaxy in MACS J1354.6+7715

 - **Abstract**
 Tailed radio galaxies are powerful tracers of interactions between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the intracluster medium (ICM), providing unique insights into cluster dynamics. We present LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) 144 MHz and uGMRT 400 MHz observations of the cluster MACS J1354.6+7715 (z = 0.3967) to investigate the radio emission associated with its member galaxies and the cluster environment. The dominant tailed radio galaxy in the cluster exhibits a sharply bent tail extending over approximately 300 kpc, with the spectral index steepening from approximately -0.46 +/- 0.21 near the AGN core to approximately -2.43 +/- 0.30 in the outermost regions. Synchrotron modelling of the tail yields a radiative age of 150 +/- 10 Myr, implying a galaxy velocity of 1956 +/- 130 km s^-1, which is of order ~ 0.9 times the escape velocity. We find no evidence of relics or halos in our radio images, and the X-ray morphology from Chandra appears relatively undisturbed, suggesting that the system is a pre-merging candidate. Our results indicate that the radio galaxy is undergoing its first infall into the cluster, providing an excellent laboratory for studying the impact of the ICM on AGN activity and galaxy evolution, and demonstrating how multi-frequency radio observations of tailed galaxies can uniquely probe both AGN lifecycles and the early stages of cluster assembly.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) We present stellar kinematics of the MUSE Most Massive Galaxies (M3G) Survey, comprising 25 galaxies brighter than -25.7 mag in the Ks-band and stellar mass above ~6x10^11 Msun. Galaxies are divided between the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and lower-ranked (in brightness) galaxies (non-BCGs) in three rich galaxy clusters within the core of the Shapley super cluster. We find several velocity maps with rich kinematic structure, including multiple spin reversals within the region encompassing central two effective radii, typically associated with BCGs. The majority of BCGs show rotation around the major-axis, at least in one of the visible velocity components. These kinematic structures are possible only if galaxies have non-axisymmetric shapes and contain several orbital families with both prograde and retrograde rotations. There are six fast rotators in the M3G sample, all among non-BCGs, and typically ranked below the 3rd brightest galaxy. Based on the properties of the h3 Gauss-Hermite moment, fast rotation can be linked to the dominance of prograde rotating short-axis tubes in the orbital distribution. Slow rotators are BCGs or the second and sometimes third brightest galaxies, indicating that the galaxy mass (brightness) is not the only driver of low spin, but that the location within the local environment also plays a role. Slow rotators, as evidenced from their multi-spin velocity maps, require more complex orbital structures. Furthermore, some BCGs show kinematic evidence for a secondary component at larger radii, likely not in equilibrium with the main galaxy and possibly made of stars accreted from other cluster galaxies. Multi-spin velocity maps, low angular momentum and additional kinematic components highlight the difference in the evolutionary histories of BCGs (including 2nd ranked galaxies) and non-BCGs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic study of the environments of 25 luminous quasars at $z > 6.5$ from the ASPIRE program. Using JWST/NIRCam WFSS data, we identified 487 galaxies at $5.3 \lesssim z \lesssim 7.0$ exhibiting [OIII] emission. Among these, 122 [OIII] emitters lie within $|\Delta v_{\rm los}| < 1000~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$ of the quasars, corresponding to a $\sim9.4$-fold enhancement relative to the average galaxy density at other redshifts. Furthermore, we identified 16 [CII]-emitting galaxies at the quasar redshifts from ALMA mosaic observations. A cross-correlation function (CCF) analysis between quasars and [OIII]+[CII] emitters yields a cross-correlation length of $r_0^{\rm QG} = 8.68^{+0.51}_{-0.55}~h^{-1}~\mathrm{cMpc}$ and a auto-correlation of $r_0^{\rm{QQ}}=15.76^{+2.48}_{-2.70}~h^{-1}~{\rm cMpc}$, indicating that $z \sim 7$ quasars reside in dark matter halos with $M_{\rm halo} = 10^{12.27^{+0.21}_{-0.26}}~M_\odot$. Notably, the number of [OIII]-emitting galaxies at quasar redshifts varies significantly from field to field, ranging from zero to twenty, highlighting a diverse quasar environment. Remarkably, seven quasars trace significant galaxy overdensities (i.e., protoclusters), with $\delta_{\rm gal} > 5$ within a volume of $V \sim 500~{\rm cMpc^3}$. We also find that $|\Delta v_{\rm los}|$ increases rapidly toward smaller galaxy-quasar separations in protocluster fields, consistent with galaxy kinematics around extremely massive halos in cosmological simulations. By combining JWST and ALMA data, we reveal the complex and diverse environments of these early quasars, providing robust evidence that the earliest luminous quasars are effective tracers of galaxy overdensities, albeit with substantial field-to-field variation.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic voids, the largest underdense regions in the Universe, provide unique laboratories for studying galaxy formation and constitute powerful probes of cosmology. Recent work has shown that individual galaxy bias (b_i), which quantifies how each galaxy traces the underlying dark matter field, exhibits a characteristic radial dependence within spherical voids, defining a void bias profile in which galaxies near void centers display systematically lower bias values. We investigate how the environmental modulation of individual galaxy bias depends on the adopted void-finding algorithm by comparing measurements across five distinct void definitions: spherical voids 'sparkling', watershed-based methods ('zobov' and 'revolver' in two modes), and free-form integrated-density voids ('popcorn'). We apply these complementary void-finding algorithms to the same galaxy sample drawn from the IllustrisTNG simulation (TNG300-1 at $z=0$) and compute individual galaxy bias profiles as a function of distance from void centers. We quantify the correlation between b_i and the membership of the void catalogs and explore how this relationship varies with the integrated underdensity threshold for density-based methods. We find that the radial gradient of individual bias within voids, generally increasing from negative values at the void centers to higher values at the boundaries, is robust across most void definitions. However, density-threshold methods preferentially select galaxies with b_i<0, while watershed methods without density constraints include substantial contamination from high-bias boundary galaxies. The correlation between negative bias and void membership is systematically strengthened as the integrated underdensity threshold becomes less restrictive, with popcorn achieving the highest purity in isolating anti-biased populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasars hosting $\gtrsim 10^{9}\,M_\odot$ black holes at $z>6$ challenge growth scenarios that start from light seeds and assume accretion within already formed galaxies. Motivated by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovery of Little Red Dots (LRDs), which suggests that $\sim 10^{6}\,M_\odot$ black holes can be active in compact, pre-galactic environments, we revisit early black hole growth with a minimal cosmology-based framework. We model the accretion history as the smaller of the Bondi inflow rate and the Eddington-limited rate, where the Bondi rate is set by the supply of overdense primordial gas whose density declines with cosmic expansion, and the Eddington rate captures regulation by radiative feedback. By fitting the observed masses and luminosities of J0313--1806 ($z=7.64$) and J0100+2802 ($z=6.30$) with Bayesian inference, we infer initial conditions that favor massive seed black holes with initial mass $M_0 \sim 10^{6}\,M_\odot$, formed at $z\sim20{-}30$ in environments with baryonic overdensity factors $f_\rho \gtrsim 50$ relative to the cosmic mean. The resulting growth histories include a prolonged supply-limited stage, and they reproduce the observed quasar masses without requiring sustained Eddington accretion or any super-Eddington episodes. The inferred seed mass scale is consistent with black holes produced by the collapse of quantum-degenerate fermion dark matter cores, providing a physically defined pathway to massive seeds at the redshifts implied by LRD phenomenology.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the structure of strange dwarfs, modeled as hybrid compact stars composed of a self bound strange quark matter core surrounded by a white dwarf like crust, within a fully relativistic framework. Static configurations are constructed by solving the Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff equations, and uniformly rotating configurations are modeled within the Hartle Thorne slow rotation expansion (to ${\cal O}(\Omega^2)$). We therefore interpret results at large fractional spins conservatively, and use the Kepler frequency mainly as a reference scale for comparing different masses and models. The stellar matter is described using a hybrid equation of state, in which the crust is modeled by a degenerate electron ion system and the core by the MIT Bag Model. By comparing strange dwarfs with conventional white dwarfs across a range of rotation rates, we show that rotation inflates the radius and can reduce (in a quantifiable way) the separation between the two families in the $(M,R)$ plane, potentially masking structural signatures associated with the presence of a quark core. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for rotational effects when interpreting mass radius measurements and other global observables in the context of searches for exotic compact objects in current and future high precision surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The evolution of cataclysmic variables (CVs) - interacting binaries where a low-mass donor transfers matter to a white dwarf via an accretion disk - is critically controlled by magnetic braking (MB). Significant uncertainties persist regarding how distinct MB formalisms influence CV evolutionary pathways. Aims. We performed systematic simulations of CV evolution under five MB prescriptions using the MESA code: the classical Skumanich law and the Matt, Reiners & Mohanty (RM12), intermediate, and convection-boosted formalisms. Primary objectives included investigating their impact on orbital period distributions, mass-transfer rates, donor star evolution, and period gap characteristics. Methods. Evolutionary sequences were computed across all MB frameworks. We analyzed their effects on key observables: orbital period evolution, accretion rates, and period gap morphology. Results. Magnetic braking prescription selection fundamentally determines whether CV systems develop the characteristic period gap. The intermediate prescription provides optimal consistency with observations of nonmagnetic CVs, simultaneously reproducing the gap location and donor properties. Strong braking models (e.g., Skumanich) produce clear detachment phases, while self-consistent regulation models (Matt12 and RM12) maintain weak angular momentum loss and fail to form a gap, making them more prone to magnetic CVs. Conclusions. The presence or absence of the period gap is primarily governed by the strength and behavior of MB before the donor becomes fully convective. Future studies must further incorporate the regulatory effects of magnetic fields on donor structure to accurately predict the period distribution characteristics of magnetic CVs.

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents integrated flux and velocity channel maps of the planetary nebula Abell 30 (A30) inner knot system. The observations were taken with the INTEGRAL spectrograph at the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). Our IFU data cube partially covers knots J1, J2, and completely covers knots J3, J4 in the system. Optical Recombination Lines of C II, He I, He II, N III, O II and Collisionally Excited Lines of [Ar IV], [Ar V], [N II], [Ne III], [Ne IV], and [O III] were detected. Our integrated flux maps visualise the ionisation structure and the chemical inhomogeneity in the system previously reported by other groups. We find that ORLs are concentrated in the polar region (J1, J3), whereas the equatorial knots (J2, J4) are dominated by CELs. The flux ratio map of the diagnostic [O III] lambda 5007/4363 Angstrom lines reveals the electron temperature distribution, which shows cold cores of 15,000 K in knots J3 and J4 surrounded by a hot outer layer of above 20,000 K. Our channel maps show positive and negative velocity excursions from the systemic value among the ions. Several ions show variation in their velocity structures from their lower-energy-level counterparts, including [Ar IV] and [Ar V], [Ne III] and [Ne IV], and He I and He II. New recurrent velocity structures are identified in the low-density regions where the ions move much faster compared to their surrounding environments. The velocity dispersion measurements highlight extreme turbulence in some of the ions (sigma_vrad approx 140 km/s), consistent with supersonic/hypersonic motion driven by shocks. The forbidden line species [N II] exhibits lower turbulence (sigma_vrad approx 50-60 km/s), tracing denser, less-turbulent gases. Based on our data, we conclude both the ionisation and kinematic studies hint at shock heating and multiple ejection history in the evolutionary pathway of A30.
#### Galactic seismology: can a disc-crossing impulse explain the large-scale perturbations in the Milky Way's disc?

 - **Abstract**
 Prior to its infall, the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy was a major satellite with a mass of $M_{\rm sgr}\sim 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$. For the past $5-6~\mathrm{Gyr}$ , it has been heavily stripped by the Milky Way (MW), losing most of its mass while crossing the MW disc multiple times. Recent models of Milky Way disc perturbations $-$ including the spiral arms, the stellar bar, the Gaia phase spiral, and stellar and gaseous disc corrugations $-$ have identified these crossings as possible formation triggers, but have generally treated each perturbation in isolation. Here, we adopt a holistic perspective and ask whether a single disc-crossing impulse can simultaneously account for these features as observed today. We focus on simulations of single disc-crossing events by a Sgr-like perturber, and present a forensic analysis of the role of the powerful impulse in forming spiral arms, disc corrugations, the phase spiral and the `$L_{z}-\bar{V}_{R}$ wave', determined from a star's angular momentum and radial velocity, respectively. We find that a single disc crossing can reproduce reasonably well (e.g. structure, amplitude, phase) the observed local disc corrugation, and the Outer, Local and Sagittarius-Carina arm segments, implying that the last significant impulse due to a transit took place $700-1200~\mathrm{Myr}$ ago. Moreover, the $L_{z}-\bar{V}_{R}$ wave and phase spiral appear within the simulations over the same epoch and their general structure is reasonably well replicated, but not in detail. We conclude that Sgr's last significant crossing roughly a Gyr ago could be the primary cause of large-scale MW disc perturbations, but it cannot fully account for the $L_{z}-\bar{V}_{R}$ wave. Consequently, other triggers, possibly the Galactic bar or interactions with other satellites, must be considered in order to fully explain the current dynamical state of the MW's disc.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the relative alignment between density structures and magnetic fields in eight young protostars from the ALMA B-field Orion Protostellar Survey. Column density maps are derived from 870 $\mu$m dust continuum emission, and the Histogram of Relative Orientations (HRO) method is applied to quantify the correlation between magnetic field orientations and density structures on envelope scales ($\sim$10$^{3}$~au). We find that the relative alignment shows overall weak evidence of systematic evolution with column density, suggesting that column density alone does not fully determine the alignment. The magnetization level also plays a crucial role, with weakly magnetized envelopes exhibiting predominantly parallel or random alignment, whereas strongly magnetized ones show perpendicular configurations even at moderate densities. These results reveal that density and magnetization jointly shape the morphology of protostellar envelopes and the coupling between gravity and magnetic fields during early stages of star formation.
#### The sub-arcsecond ILT view of the Boötes Deep Field: A link between low-frequency kiloparsec radio morphology and AGN driven ionised outflows

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) outflows can regulate host galaxy evolution via AGN feedback. Ionised gas outflows have been linked to enhanced radio emission. In the first paper of this series, AGN detected with the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) at 6" were more likely to host an [O III] 5007 outflow than AGN not detected, although only high-powered jets were ruled out as the origin of radio emission. New wide-field, sub-arcsecond resolution imaging at 144 MHz with the ILT now enables a resolved morphological study of this sample. We present the first wide-field, sub-arcsecond images of the Boötes Deep Field at 144 MHz, detecting 4074 sources in the $\sim$0.3" image with a central sensitivity of 33.8 uJy $\mathrm{beam^{-1}}$. For 47 AGN matched in AGN luminosity, we probe radio emission on kiloparsec-scales to investigate correlations with [O III] outflows. This sample spans $z<0.83$, $10^{40}<L_{\mathrm{[O III]}}<10^{43}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$, and $10^{21}<L_{\mathrm{144MHz}}<10^{24.5}~\mathrm{W~Hz^{-1}}$. We find that if we detect an AGN on both large-scales (6") and small-scales (0.3"), 90$\pm$7 per cent have an [O III] outflow, compared to 63$\pm$9 per cent of sources detected on large-scales, but undetected on small-scales. Furthermore, 17$\pm$6 per cent of sources without an [O III] outflow are detected on kiloparsec-scales, compared to 51$\pm$12 per cent of sources with an [O III] outflow. This implies a connection between [O III] outflows and kiloparsec-scale radio emission, which is likely AGN-driven. In contrast, AGN without an [O III] outflow are dominated by diffuse radio emission, likely to be associated with star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical evolution in star forming regions is driven by the interplay between gas and ice mantles. Identifying the ice compositions at the early stage of star formation thus provides constraints on the chemical processes inaccessible from gas-phase characterizations. As part of the CORINOS program, spectra from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) MIRI MRS were taken toward four Class 0 protostars: IRAS 15398-3359, Ser-emb7, L483, and B335. The spectra were processed with simultaneous fitting of a continuum and silicate absorption to produce optical depth mid-infrared spectra of the ices at 5-28 $\mu$m (360-2000 cm$^{-1}$) toward these four sources. Simple molecules such as water (H$_2$O), carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), methanol (CH$_3$OH), formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO$^-$), ammonia/ammonium (NH$_3$/NH$_4$$^+$), and formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) are the most abundant features in these ices, while complex organic molecules (COMs) represent a smaller contribution. Likely COMs include hydroxylamine (NH$_2$OH), methylamine (CH$_3$NH$_2$), and ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH). Absorption features belonging to functional groups such as -CH$_3$ and -OH suggest that additional COMs are present, but these cannot be unambiguously assigned due to overlapping bands. Formation pathways toward these COMs utilizing radical-radical combination reactions based on laboratory simulation experiments is presented. By extension, COMs predicted by these reactions, but absent from the spectra, are discussed. The results provide insight into the chemical environment of these ices and also highlight the critical need for caution and sufficient evidence in order to confidently identify COMs in ice.
#### Mergers Drive Structural Complexity but Not Starbursts in Lyman-$α$ Emitters at $3 < z < 4$: A JWST Spatially Resolved View

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal that the merger fraction among Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at redshifts $z > 3$ is significantly higher than previously estimated. In this study, we focus on three high signal-to-noise merging LAE systems at $3 < z < 4$, selected from the VLT/MUSE-Deep survey in the GOODS-S field. We combine new \textit{JWST}/NIRCam broadband and medium-band imaging with archival \textit{HST}/ACS data to perform spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using the \textsc{Bagpipes} software package. Our analysis reveals that two of the systems are minor mergers, while the third is a major merger. The close agreement between spatially resolved and integrated stellar mass estimates indicates that recent star formation does not significantly outshine the light from older stellar populations in these systems. Moreover, both the individual components and the systems as a whole lie on the star-forming main sequence, further supporting the conclusion that these mergers have not yet triggered substantial starburst activity. Furthermore, we detect prominent color gradients and disturbed dust distributions in these merging systems, indicating that the mergers have already induced significant internal structural perturbations. These morphological and dust-related changes may facilitate the escape of Ly$\alpha$ photons -- potentially through mechanisms such as gas redistribution or a reduced covering fraction of neutral hydrogen -- thereby playing a key role in shaping the observed properties of LAEs.

 Electromagnetic scattering and absorption by material particles is a fundamental physical problem with a broad range of applications, going from laboratory experiments, biology and material sciences, all the way up to environmental studies and astrophysical investigations. In spite of its primary importance, an exact theoretical treatment is only possible for a limited range of ideal cases, while realistic situations require the development of numerical solutions. In the course of the years, several techniques were developed to model the effects of scattering and absorption in more general cases, using approaches such as the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA), the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method, the Transition Matrix formalism (T-matrix) or the Mean Field Theory (MFT). Among these possibilities, the T-matrix approach grants the highest degree of flexibility in modeling aggregates of spherically symmetric particles with arbitrary overall morphology and composition, but its application has been limited by the challenging computational requirements of the method in realistic cases. This paper describes the Nano-Particle Transition Matrix Code project (NP_TMcode), a new implementation of the T-matrix formalism that, taking advantage of high performance parallel hardware architectures, allows the solution of increasingly complex models, while substantially reducing the computing time. The paper describes the code structure, with a particular focus on the algorithm optimization, and it presents the results of the performance analysis for a set of development applications.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we examine the motion of test particles and relativistic accretion mechanisms within the spacetime of a rotating and embedded BH. In this case, the geometric properties of the metric and their dynamical consequences for particle trajectories are systematically studied, with a specific focus on circular orbits together with their existence criteria and stability constraints. Also, the effective potential and the corresponding effective force are constructed to quantify the influence of rotation and embedding parameters on the attractive and repulsive sectors of the gravitational interaction. Closed-form expressions for orbital frequencies as measured by a distant observer are derived, enabling a quantitative analysis of relativistic precession phenomena, including periastron advance and Lense-Thirring precession. Furthermore, we conduct general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of BHL accretion onto rotating embedded BHs. In addition, within the framework of the BHL accretion mechanism, the numerical solution of the GRH equations shows that the embedding parameter \alpha systematically modifies the morphology of the shock cone formed around embedded BHs compared to the Kerr model. In particular, a wider opening angle of the cone is produced, the compression of matter in the post-shock region is weakened, and the dynamical variability of the flow is enhanced. The time-dependent mass accretion rate exhibits increasing oscillation amplitudes and long-term variations with increasing \alpha, while these amplitudes are found to be suppressed by the frame-dragging effect associated with the BH spin parameter. At the same time, increasing values of $\alpha$ lead to a strengthening of the QPO frequencies formed around embedded BHs in the LFQPO regime, enhancing their observability and increasing the likelihood of detecting commensurate frequency ratios such as 3:2.

 - **Abstract**
 Tree codes that approximate groups of distant particles with multipole expansions are the standard way to accelerate the computation of self-gravity on particles. While momentum-conserving fast multipole methods exist, parallelisation is non-trivial and previous implementations have been limited to self-gravity with fixed softening lengths. We aim for a practical, parallel version of Dehnen's momentum-conserving Cartesian fast multipole method for the computation of the gravitational force in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with adaptive gravitational force softening. We parallelise the dual tree walk by replicating the node-node interaction on the parents of each leaf node in the tree. While this duplicates work, it greatly simplifies the parallelisation and can be implemented with relatively minor changes from the previous non-conservative force algorithm in Phantom. We also adapt the tree opening criterion for adaptive softening lengths, such that all interactions within the softening kernel are handled pairwise (as in SPH) rather than with multipole expansions, also allowing the gravity calculation to be performed alongside the SPH force evaluation. We demonstrate that the new code conserves linear momentum to machine precision while giving similar force accuracy and computational performance to the previous (non-symmetric) fast multipole method in Phantom . The new method also gives better conservation of the angular momentum and orbital phase in a binary polytrope evolution. The symmetric fast multipole method is now the default for computing self-gravity in the public code.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio observations offer a dust-independent probe of star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, but sufficiently deep data are required to access the crossover luminosity between these processes at high redshift ($z>4.5$). We present three spectroscopically confirmed high-redshift radio sources (HzRSs) detected at 1.3 GHz at $z=4.9$-$5.6$, with radio luminosities spanning $L_{\rm 1.3 \, GHz}\approx2$-$5\times10^{24} \, \rm W \, Hz^{-1}$. These sources were first identified as high-redshift candidates through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of archival Hubble, JWST NIRCam+MIRI, and ground-based photometry, and then spectroscopically confirmed via the $\rm H\,\alpha$ emission line using wide-field slitless spectroscopy from JWST COSMOS-3D. The star formation rates (SFRs) measured from SED fitting, the $\rm H\,\alpha$ flux, and the 1.3 GHz luminosity, span $\sim100$-$1800\, M_{\odot} \, \rm yr^{-1}$, demonstrating broad agreement between these SFR tracers. We find that these three sources lie either on or $0.5$-1.0 dex above the star-forming main sequence at $z=4$-6 and have undergone a recent burst of star formation. The sources have extended rest-UV/optical morphologies with no evidence for a dominant point source component, indicating that an AGN is unlikely to dominate their rest-UV and optical emission. Two of the sources have complex, multi-component rest-frame UV/optical morphologies, suggesting that their starbursts may be triggered by merging activity. These HzRSs open up a new window towards probing radio emission powered by star formation alone at $z> 4.5$, representing a remarkable opportunity to begin tracing star formation, independent of dust, in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how galaxies trace the underlying matter density field is essential for characterizing the influence of the large-scale structure on galaxy formation, being therefore a key ingredient in observational cosmology. This connection, commonly described through the galaxy bias, $b$, can be studied effectively using machine learning (ML) techniques, which offer strong predictive capabilities and can capture non-linear relationships. We aim to incorporate the linear bias parameter assigned to individual galaxies into a ML framework, quantify its dependence on various halo and environmental properties, and evaluate whether different algorithms can accurately predict this parameter and reproduce the scatter in several bias relations. We use data from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation, including the distance to different cosmic-web structures computed with DisPerSE. These data are complemented with an object-by-object estimator of the large-scale linear bias ($b_i$), providing the individual contribution of each galaxy to the bias of the entire population. Our ML framework uses three models to predict $b_i$: a Random Forest Regressor, a Neural Network and a probabilistic method (Normalizing Flows). We recover the full hierarchy of galaxy bias dependencies, showing that the most informative features are the overdensities, particularly $\delta_8$, followed by the distances to cosmic-web structures and selected internal halo properties, most notably $z_{1/2}$. We also demonstrate that Normalizing Flows clearly outperform deterministic methods in predicting galaxy bias, including its joint distributions with galaxy properties, owing to their ability to capture the intrinsic variance associated with the stochastic nature of the matter-halo-galaxy connection. Our ML framework provides a foundation for future efforts to measure individual bias with upcoming spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a timing analysis of over 18 years of data on the young ($\tau_{\rm c} = 112$ kyr, $P = 114$\,ms) relativistic binary PSR~J1906+0746, using six radio telescopes: Arecibo, FAST, Green Bank, Lovell, MeerKAT, and Nançay. This pulsar is known to orbit a compact high-mass companion with a period of 3.98\,hrs in a mildly eccentric orbit ($e = 0.085$). By combining all data and maintaining a coherent timing solution over the full span, we obtained a more precise measurement of the advance of periastron, $\dot{\omega} = 7.5841(2)$\,$°$\,yr$^{-1}$, the Einstein delay, $\gamma = 4.59(2) \times 10^{-4}$\,s, and the secular change in orbital period, $\dot{P}_{\rm b} = -5.65(2) \times 10^{-13}$\,s\,s$^{-1}$. Assuming the validity of general relativity, we obtain a total mass of 2.6133(1)\,$M_{\odot}$ and component masses of 1.316(5) $M_{\odot}$ for the pulsar and 1.297(5) $M_{\odot}$ for the companion, consistent with a double neutron star system. However, when fitting for the secular change in the projected semi-major axis we obtain $\dot{x} = -1.8(6) \times 10^{-13}$\,s\,s$^{-1}$, the component masses are shifted by $\sim 3.5\sigma$, which is expected from the correlation of $\dot{x}$ and $\gamma$. The $\dot{x}$ has a similar magnitude to that observed in PSR~J1141$-$6545, which is due to spin-orbit coupling; if confirmed, it would indicate that, as in the latter system, the companion of the PSR~J1906+0746 system is a massive fast-rotating white dwarf formed before the pulsar. Additionally, we report and characterize a large glitch near MJD 56664, with a fractional frequency increase comparable to those observed in the Vela pulsar.
