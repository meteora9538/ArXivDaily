#### Episodic planetesimal disruptions triggered by dissipation of gas disk

 - **Abstract**
 Catastrophic disruptions of planetesimals occur in high-velocity collisions. Radioisotope dating of planetesimal disruption events recorded in meteorites confirms frequent catastrophic collisions in the first $\sim$10 Myr of the Solar System, reflecting a violent environment of the time. However, the nebula gas can damp the eccentricity of planetesimals and suppress the frequency of planetesimal collisions. Strong dynamical mechanisms that excited the protoplanetary disk are required. Here we show that the sweeping secular resonances of Jupiter and Saturn induced by the nebular gas dissipation, together with the mean motion resonances of Jupiter, can trigger a large number of catastrophic collisions, which occur episodically when the secular resonances are at $\sim$2-3 au and continue thereafter. After the gas dissipation completes, catastrophic collisions decrease in frequency, with scattering by planetary embryos becoming the major driving force of the collisions. Our results suggest that the violent environment excited by secular and mean motion resonances can be ubiquitous in protoplanetary disks during nebula dissipation.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations claim the existence of a significant fraction of bars in the kinematically hotter and thicker disk at high redshift Universe. These observations challenge the current understanding of disk stability in galaxies similar to the Milky Way. The analytical work and N-body simulations suggest that the kinematically hot (dispersion-dominated) and thick disk are stable against bar formation. In this work, we perform the controlled N-body simulations of a kinematically hot and thick disk, which is residing in a non-rotating and spinning dark matter halo. We report that the disk, which is classically stable against bar instability in the live and non-rotating halo, leads to bar formation in a spinning halo environment. The spinning halo model is 8 times more efficient in transporting angular momentum from the disk to the halo compared to the non-spinning halo. We claim that Ostriker-Peebles and ELN bar formation criteria do not predict bar formation for both the non-roating and spinning halo. The recent criteria from Jang-Kim successfully predict the bar stability for the non-rotating halo model, but not for the spinning halo model. These results provide an important insight into the bar formation processes for thick and hot disks at high redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar hydrocarbon dust containing aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is believed to be processed by various factors including UV radiation fields and mechanical shocks in the galactic environments. We systematically investigate the processing of hydrocarbon dust, especially the likely causes for the variations of the luminosity ratio of aliphatic to aromatic hydrocarbon emission features, using the near-infrared (IR) spectral features at wavelengths 3.3 um and 3.4-3.6 um observed with AKARI/IRC. We analyzed 243 near-IR spectra of 240 star-forming (U)LIRGs (the total IR luminosity, $L_\rm{IR}>10^{11}\ L_\odot$), 119 spectra of 105 star-forming IRGs ($10^{10}\ L_\odot<L_\rm{IR}<10^{11}\ L_\odot$), and 94 spectra of 65 sub-IRGs ($L_\rm{IR}<10^{10}\ L_\odot$), in addition to 232 spectra of 36 Galactic HII regions as a reference sample. We performed near-IR spectral model fitting to estimate the luminosities of the aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon features and the HI recombination line Br$\rm{\alpha}$. The result indicates that the luminosity ratios of the aliphatic to the aromatic hydrocarbons ($L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$) in the sample galaxies show considerably large variations, compared to those in the Galactic HII regions, $L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$ systematically decreasing with $L_\rm{IR}$ and $L_\rm{Br\alpha}$. We find that (sub-)IRGs with continuum colors bluer at 4 um tend to have higher $L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$, which is likely to reflect the intrinsic nature of PAHs outside the HII region where the PAHs remain non-processed by strong UV radiation fields. We also find that some ULIRGs with continuum colors redder at 4 um show extremely low $L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$, which is likely to be caused by blending aliphatic emission and absorption features due to the presence of an obscured galactic nucleus in merger systems.
#### Compact Ca II K Brightenings Precede Solar Flares: A Dunn Solar Telescope Pilot Study

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21872

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21872

 - **Abstract**
 We present a uniform analysis of compact Ca II K (3934 Å) brightenings that occur near flare kernels and assess their value as short-lead indicators of solar flare onset. Using high-cadence imaging from the Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) instrument at the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST), we examine eight flare sequences (seven C-class and one B-class) obtained between 2021 and 2025. Fixed, detector-coordinate regions of interest are used to generate mean-intensity light curves, which are detrended and smoothed to isolate impulsive brightenings. In every event, a compact Ca II K brightening is detected within or adjacent to the flaring region that peaks 10--45 min before the primary kernel and the corresponding rise in GOES 1--8 Å flux. The measured temporal offsets scale with the deprojected separation between the brightening and flare kernels, implying an apparent propagation speed of $\sim$30--35 km s$^{-1}$ that is consistent with chromospheric reconnection. Complementary Spectropolarimeter for Infrared and Optical Regions (SPINOR) spectropolarimetry for one event shows topological reconfiguration from closed to open or extended connectivity, supporting a reconnection-driven origin. These results demonstrate that compact Ca II K brightenings are reproducible, physically meaningful precursors to flare onset. Their simplicity and cadence make them attractive chromospheric indicators, and future work will evaluate their predictive skill alongside established UV/EUV and magnetic diagnostics.
#### The First X-ray Polarimetry of GRS 1739--278 Reveals Its Rapidly Spinning Black Hole

 - **Abstract**
 We present a joint spectro-polarimetric analysis of the black hole X-ray binary GRS~1739--278 during its 2025 mini-outburst, using simultaneous observations from \ixpe\ and \nustar. The \ixpe\ data show a polarization degree of ${\rm PD} = (2.3 \pm 0.4)\%$ and a polarization angle of ${\rm PA} = 62^\circ \pm 5^\circ$ in the 2--8~keV range. The model-independent analysis reveals that the PD increases from $\sim 2\%$ at 2~keV to $\sim 10\%$ in the 6--8~keV band, while the PA remains stable across the \ixpe\ band within statistical uncertainties. Broadband spectral modeling of the combined \ixpe\ and \nustar\ datasets shows that hard Comptonization contributes negligibly in this soft-state observation, while a substantial reflected component is required in addition to the thermal disk emission. We then model the \ixpe\ Stokes spectra using the \texttt{kynbbrr} model. The best-fitting results indicate that high-spin configurations enhance the contribution of reflected returning radiation, which dominates the observed polarization properties. From the \texttt{kynbbrr} modeling, we infer an extreme black hole spin of $a = 0.994^{+0.004}_{-0.003}$ and a system inclination of $i = 54^\circ{}^{+8^\circ}_{-4^\circ}$. Owing to the large contribution from returning radiation, the observed polarization direction is nearly parallel to the projected system axis, the position angle of which is predicted to be $58^\circ \pm 4^\circ$. Our results demonstrate that X-ray polarimetry, combined with broadband spectroscopy, directly probes the geometry and relativistic effects in accretion disks around stellar-mass black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Signatures of massive particles during inflation are highly informative targets for cosmological experiments. With recent progress on both theoretical and observational frontiers, we have reached the point where these novel signals of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) can be systematically tested with increasingly precise data. In this paper, we present the results of improved CMB data analysis for cosmological collider signals using Planck CMB data. To set the stage, we first construct a set of simplified but characteristic collider templates which are accurate over a broad range of particle masses, spins and sound speeds. In order to break degeneracies with single-field PNG, we propose an orthogonalization scheme such that the collider templates are uncorrelated with the highly constrained equilateral and orthogonal shapes. On this basis, we deploy the Modal bispectrum estimator for the Planck analysis and perform a systematic scan of parameters to search for the most significant collider signal. The maximum signal-to-noise ratio is found to be $2.35\sigma$ for massive spin-0 exchange after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect. In addition, we cross-validate the Modal analysis with the CMB-BEST pipeline, which demonstrates the consistency of results across the benchmark examples of collider templates. Given the low signal-to-noise ratio regime we find at the current stage of PNG observations, we believe the orthogonalization procedure provides an optimized strategy for future tests of the cosmological collider with the ability to rule out single field inflation.
