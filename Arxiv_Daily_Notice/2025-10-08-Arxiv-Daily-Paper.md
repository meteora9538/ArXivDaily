 - **Abstract**
 Upward emission of artificial light has been investigated by researchers since the commissioning of the Visible/Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) in 2011, with applications ranging from night time light mapping to quantifying socio-economical development. The wide swath of the VIIRS-DNB sensor enables detection of artificial light at multiple angles and was utilized to study emission of artificial light from cities at different angles as well as atmospheric properties. Existing studies of the relationship between the directionality and land surface features are not available for most of the Earth's surface due to the use of space-borne LiDAR as a source of proxy. To solve this problem, we compared the land use data published under the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) against the fit parameters of radiance of upward artificial light. In general, the quadratic term of the fit, which quantifies how the brightness changes when viewing closer from the horizon at a point on the Earth, is negative when the area is "Continuous urban fabric" or "Sparsely vegetated areas", and vice versa for all other investigated land use classes. However the quadratic term shifts towards negative values for brighter areas. These results indicate that while densely built areas emit more light towards the zenith than sideways, the VIIRS-DNB is unable to distinguish small densely built areas scattered around larger unbuilt areas. Therefore, sensors with higher spatial resolution will be required to resolve the light emission patterns of areas with complicated combinations of land uses.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the MEGATRON suite of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations following the formation of Milky Way-mass galaxies from the earliest cosmic epochs when Population III stars form to Cosmic Noon. The suite represents the first set of cosmological simulations that couples a vast non-equilibrium thermochemistry network of primordial species, metals, and molecules to multifrequency, on-the-fly radiation transport, allowing us to directly predict the spectral properties of early galaxies. By initializing the simulations at zero metallicity, resolving haloes well below the atomic cooling threshold, reaching parsec-scale resolution, and modeling a Milky Way-mass environment, we aim to address four key science themes: 1) Star formation at cosmic dawn, 2) Galaxy formation and the interstellar medium in the epoch of reionization, 3) The circumgalactic medium towards cosmic noon, and 4) Reionization in a local volume environment and near-field cosmology. In this introductory work, we present an overview of the physical characteristics of high-redshift MEGATRON galaxies and their environment at $z>8$. We present a library of $>175,000$ simulated galaxy spectra and demonstrate how the diversity of galaxy spectra seen by JWST is naturally reproduced in the context of a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This project represents a step towards making more direct comparisons between simulations and observations and will enable future work to both optimize methods for inferring galaxy properties from observations and to elucidate the physics that governs galaxy formation in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present radial profiles of surface brightness in UV and IR bands, estimate stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_\star$) and star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$), and predict the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$) for over 5,000 local galaxies with stellar mass $M_\star\,{\geq}\,10^{9.3}\rm\,M_\odot$. We build these profiles and measure galaxy half-light radii using GALEX and WISE images from the $z$0MGS program, with special care given to highly inclined galaxies. From the UV and IR surface brightness profiles, we estimate $\Sigma_\star$ and $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ and use them to predict $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ with state-of-the-art empirical prescriptions. We validate our (kpc-scale) $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ predictions against observational estimates, finding the best agreement when accounting for CO-dark gas as well as CO emissivity and excitation effects. The CO-dark correction plays a primary role in lower-mass galaxies, whereas CO emissivity and excitation effects become more important in higher-mass and more actively star-forming galaxies, respectively. We compare our estimated $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ to observed galaxy-integrated SFR to CO luminosity ratio as a function of $M_\star$. A large compilation of literature data suggests that star-forming galaxies with $M_\star = 10^{9.5{-}11}\,M_\odot$ show strong anti-correlations of SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO(1{-}0)} \propto M_\star^{-0.29}$ and SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO(2{-}1)} \propto M_\star^{-0.40}$. The estimated $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ trends, when combined with a constant molecular gas depletion time $t_\mathrm{dep}$, can only explain ${\approx}1/3$ of these SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO}$ trends. This suggests that $t_\mathrm{dep}$ being systematically shorter in lower-mass star-forming galaxies is the main cause of the observed SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO}$ variations. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the association between galaxies and neutral OI absorption systems at z~6, which trace metal-enriched gas during the epoch of reionization. We identify 40 galaxies across six quasar fields, residing in 15 overdensities within 300 kpc of the background sightlines. Five OI absorption systems are associated with five of these overdensities, yielding a covering fraction of $0.27^{+0.13}_{-0.10}$ within 300 kpc. The absorption occurs beyond typical virial radii, indicating that the gas traces extended overdensity environments rather than individual galaxy halos, unlike the z~0 CGM which is largely bound to halos. These galaxy-associated absorbers account for $\sim35\%$ of all OI systems seen in blind quasar surveys, implying the remainder arise in lower-mass galaxies below our detection threshold or in dense neutral IGM pockets. The CGM around these galaxies contains $\gtrsim 2\times10^6~M_{\odot}$ of oxygen, comparable to the ISM oxygen mass of the galaxies themselves, suggesting that the surrounding environment holds as much metal mass as the galaxies. All five galaxy-associated systems show significantly higher $\log(N_{\rm CII}/N_{\rm OI})$ ratios than absorbers lacking galaxy associations. Furthermore, relative abundance ratios ([Si/O], [C/O]) reveal that four of the five exhibit enrichment patterns consistent with Population III nucleosynthesis. These rare systems offer a unique window into the role of first-generation stars in shaping the early metal enrichment of galaxies and their environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Disk galaxies like the Milky Way are expected to experience gas flows carrying matter toward their centers. This paper investigates the role of these radial gas flows in models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We follow five different parameterizations of the Galactocentric radial velocity, $v_{r,g}$, of the interstellar medium (ISM). Relative to the $v_{r,g}=0$ limit, all models predict stellar metallicity to decline less significantly with age in the outer disk and more significantly in the inner disk. This outcome arises because radial flows cannot remove gas from one region of the Galaxy without placing it elsewhere, leading to opposing effects on enrichment timescales between the inner and outer Galaxy. This prediction is at odds with recent observational constraints, which indicate remarkably minimal decline in metallicity ($\lesssim$$0.1$ dex) between young ($\sim$$0-2$ Gyr) and old populations ($\sim$$8-10$ Gyr) across the \textit{entire} Galactic disk. Radial gas flows cannot be the sole explanation of this result at all Galactocentric radii. Our models reproduce this result at $R\gtrsim6$ kpc if the flow velocity is relatively constant in both radius and time near $v_{r,g}\approx-1$ km/s. In agreement with previous GCE models, all of our flow prescriptions lead to lower metallicities and steeper radial gradients relative to static models. Exploiting this universal outcome, we identify mixing effects and the relative rates of star formation and metal-poor accretion as the processes that establish the ISM metallicity at low redshift. We provide a suite of analytic formulae describing radial metallicity gradient evolution based on this connection.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the stellar mass-iron metallicity relation of dwarf galaxies in the new high-resolution MEGATRON cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. These simulations model galaxy formation up to $z\approx8$ in a region that will collapse into a Milky-Way-like galaxy at $z=0$, while self-consistently tracking Population III and II (Pop.~III, Pop.~II) star formation, feedback and chemical enrichment. MEGATRON dwarf galaxies are in excellent agreement with the observed stellar mass-metallicity relation at $z=0$, including an over-abundance of dwarfs along a flat plateau in metallicity ($\langle [\rm{Fe}/\rm{H}] \rangle \approx -2.5$) at low stellar masses ($M_{\star} \leq 10^5 \, \rm{M}_{\odot}$). We tie this feature to the chemical enrichment of dwarf galaxies by Pop.~III pair-instability supernova (PISN) explosions. The strong Lyman-Werner background (LW) from the protogalaxy ensures that PISNe occur in haloes massive enough ($\approx 10^7\, \rm{M}_{\odot}$) to retain their ejecta. We also predict a tail of $\approx 20\%$ of iron-deficient ($\langle [\rm{Fe}/\rm{H}] \rangle \leq - 3$) dwarf galaxies. We show that both plateau and tail (i) are robust to large variations in Pop.~II feedback assumptions, and (ii) survive in bound satellites surrounding the central galaxy at $z=0$.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) generate powerful relativistic jets that inject a large amount of energy into their surrounding environment, producing blast waves that accelerate particles to high energies. The GRB afterglow radiation provides a powerful means to investigate the microphysics of relativistic shocks and to probe the medium surrounding the progenitor of the burst. In this study, we present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of 31 GRBs observed between 2008 and 2024 from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (X-ray Telescope and Burst Alert Telescope) and the Fermi Large Area Telescope, covering photon energies from 0.3 keV to 300 GeV. Our goal is to characterize the broadband spectral properties of GRB afterglows in soft X-rays, hard X-rays, and high-energy gamma rays. We investigate correlations between spectral shape and energy output across different parts of the spectrum. The observed emission is modeled using a forward shock scenario that includes both synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation losses. The results favor an SSC-dominated radiation model in a wind-like medium, consistent with expectations for long-duration GRBs. Crucially, this work provides new benchmarks for the microphysical parameters governing the emission, particularly indicating a notably low magnetic energy fraction, which refines previous estimates. By modeling broadband data, this study offers one of the most detailed SSC analyses in a wind-like environment to date. Notably, our results naturally account for the comparable energy output observed in both the soft X-ray and TeV bands, consistent with the previously detected TeV-GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrodynamic escape can strip the envelopes of close-in exoplanets, but most observations of atmospheric mass loss to date have been confined to planets orbiting K and M dwarfs. A growing body of detections of atmospheric escape from planets orbiting early-type stars indicates that they may have significantly stronger and more extended outflows than planets orbiting cooler stars. However, it is unclear whether this limited sample of planets is representative of all gas giants orbiting early-type stars. Motivated by this question, we initiated the first dedicated survey of atmospheric escape from gas giants orbiting F stars in order to understand how their distinct radiation environments shape planetary outflows. We observed ten transits of six planets in an ultra-narrowband filter centered on the metastable helium line using Palomar/WIRC. We report strong ($>3\sigma$) detections of atmospheric escape for WASP-12~b and WASP-180~A~b, tentative ($>2\sigma$) detections for WASP-93~b and HAT-P-8~b, and non-detections for WASP-103~b and KELT-7~b. We fit these measurements with a 1D Parker wind model to derive corresponding mass-loss rates, and combine our results with literature measurements to obtain an updated picture of mass loss from planets orbiting early-type stars. Our results indicate that the observed variation in mass-loss rates can be explained by a combination of Roche filling factor and XUV luminosity, and disfavors NUV-driven escape models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed comparison of a Local Group dwarf galaxy analogue evolved in two cosmological models: the standard $\Lambda$CDM and a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model with a velocity-dependent cross-section. Both simulations are run with the high-resolution, hydrodynamical LYRA galaxy formation model, allowing us to explore the global and substructure properties of the dwarf in a consistent context. While the overall halo growth, final mass, and subhalo mass functions remain largely unchanged across models, SIDM produces a central dark matter core extending to $\sim$1 kpc, which does not significantly vary with the inclusion of baryons. Baryonic properties, however, differ notably. The SIDM model leads to a 25% reduction in stellar mass and retains more gas within the stellar half-mass radius due to a prolonged quiescent phase in star formation. The stellar distribution is less centrally concentrated, and a population of in-situ star clusters form at late times. Substructure analysis reveals fewer luminous satellites and more stellar-only systems in SIDM, driven in part by tidal stripping that affects the dark matter more than the stars. A subset of satellites undergoes tidal-triggered core collapse after infall, enhancing the diversity of SIDM satellite rotation curves. These differences offer potential observational signatures of SIDM in low-mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope has found an unexpected population of high-mass galaxies ($\log (M^\star / {\rm M} _\odot) \gtrsim 10$) with extremely small effective radii ($\sim 100\,\rm pc$) at $z \gtrsim 6$. Also, the existence of an unusual size--mass relation has been claimed. These observations are only partially reproduced by current models, and the physics responsible for the observed relations is still under debate. We expect to unveil the formation channels of the observed compact galaxies. We analyse 7605 snapshots for 169 galaxies of the state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suite FirstLight. We find that galaxies undergo an expansion--compaction--re-expansion process. This process operates in a specific mass range; compaction starts at $\log (M^\star_ {\rm on} / {\rm M}_\odot) \sim 8.5$ and ends at $\log (M^\star_{\rm off} / \mathrm{M}_\odot) \sim 9.5$. In between these masses, the size--mass relation becomes inverted, with a negative slope. The physical mechanism driving this process in our simulations involves a self-reinforced inflow of gas from the outer regions, that triggers a strong, localised starburst at the centre (within $1\, {\rm kpc}$). This contraction continues until conditions favour star formation in a broader area, and the normal inside-out growth pattern resumes. We present evidence for the existence of a universal wet compaction operating at Cosmic Dawn. This mechanism is driven by spherical accretion triggered by the change of the state of the central matter of galaxies, from dark matter- to baryon-dominated. We also propose an analytical expression for the infall process, suitable for use in semi-analytic models. Contrary to low-redshift galaxies, in high-redshift systems compaction ends without gas depletion and star-formation quenching.

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of massive and compact early-type galaxies provide important constraints on early galaxy formation. Among these, massive relic galaxies, characterized by old stellar populations and minimal late-time accretion, are considered preserved compact galaxies from the high-$z$ Universe. We investigate compact and massive galaxies (CMGs) using the TNG50 cosmological simulation, applying uniform selection criteria matching observational surveys at $z=0$, $z=0.3$, and $z=0.7$, enabling direct comparisons with observed compact galaxies. CMGs are classified according to their stellar mass assembly histories to examine how compactness relates to dynamical properties and chemical enrichment across cosmic time. Our results show that simulated CMGs follow the observed mass-size relation, with the number of objects increasing at higher redshifts, in line with observational trends. Dynamically, while observations suggest relic galaxies are outliers in the stellar mass-velocity dispersion plane, simulated compacts show relatively uniform velocity dispersions across different accretion histories. Observed relics are more metal-rich than other compact galaxies with extended star formation, deviating from the local mass-metallicity relation. In contrast, simulated CMGs are overall more metal-rich than the quiescent population, regardless of accretion history. The deviation from the mass-metallicity relation decreases with redshift. These results suggest that the extreme characteristics of CMGs in TNG50, particularly in metallicity and dynamics, are less pronounced than in observed relics. Nonetheless, these results offer a theoretical framework to assess the properties of such extreme objects from different epochs, highlighting both alignment with and deviations between the models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of bursty star-formation histories (SFHs) of 346 star-forming galaxies at $1\lesssim z<7$, selected from JWST/NIRSpec G395M and PRISM spectroscopy provided by the CEERS and RUBIES surveys. We analyze the correlation of star-formation rate vs. stellar mass (the star-forming main sequence, SFMS) for our sample and find no significant difference between the intrinsic scatter in the H$\alpha$-based SFMS and the UV-continuum-based SFMS. However, the diagnostic power of the SFMS is limited at high redshift and low stellar mass due to observational biases that exclude faint, quenched galaxies. To more directly probe star-formation variability, we examine the dust-corrected H$\alpha$-to-UV ratio, which is assumed to trace deviations a from constant SFH over the past $\sim100$ Myr. In our sample, $73^{+4}_{-4}$% of galaxies exhibit H$\alpha$-to-UV ratios inconsistent with a constant SFH. We do not observe any statistically significant evolution in the H$\alpha$-to-UV ratio with redshift. Additionally, lower-mass galaxies ($7\leq\text{log}(M_*/M_{\odot})<8.5$) are $30 \pm 1$% more likely to lie above this equilibrium range -- indicative of a recent ($\lesssim 100$ Myr) burst of star formation -- compared to higher-mass systems ($8.5\leq\text{log}(M_*/M_{\odot})\leq10.9$). These results suggest that bursty SFHs are more common in low-mass galaxies at $z\sim 1$-$7$ and that this remains relatively stable across $\sim0.8$-$6$ Gyr after the Big Bang.
#### SN 2021tsz: A luminous, short photospheric phase Type II supernova in a low-metallicity host

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of the luminous Type II Supernova (SN) 2021tsz, which exploded in a low-luminosity galaxy. It reached a peak magnitude of -18.88 $\pm$ 0.13 mag in the $r$ band and exhibited an initial rapid decline of 4.05 $\pm$ 0.14 mag (100 d)$^{-1}$ from peak luminosity till $\sim$30 d. The photospheric phase is short, with the SN displaying bluer colours and a weak H$\alpha$ absorption component--features consistent with other luminous, short-photospheric phase Type II SNe. A distinct transition from the photospheric to the radioactive tail phase in the $V$ band--as is common in hydrogen-rich Type II SNe--is not visible in SN 2021tsz, although a modest $\sim$1 mag drop is apparent in the redder filters. Hydrodynamic modelling suggests the luminosity is powered by ejecta-circumstellar material (CSM) interaction during the early phases (<30 days). Interaction with 0.6 M$_\odot$ of dense CSM extending to 3100 R$_\odot$ reproduces the observed luminosity, with an explosion energy of 1.3$\times$10$^{51}$ erg. The modelling indicates a pre-SN mass of 9 M$_\odot$, which includes a hydrogen envelope of 4 M$_\odot$, and a radius of $\sim$1000 R$_\odot$. Spectral energy distribution analysis and strong-line diagnostics reveal that the host galaxy of SN 2021tsz is a low-metallicity, dwarf galaxy. The low-metallicity environment and the derived high mass loss from the hydrodynamical modelling strongly support a binary progenitor system for SN 2021tsz.

 - **Abstract**
 The intrinsic width and scattering distributions of fast radio bursts (FRBs) inform on their emission mechanism and local environment, and act as a source of detection bias and, hence, an obfuscating factor when performing FRB population and cosmological studies. Here, we utilise a sample of 29 FRBs with measured high-time-resolution properties and known redshift, which were detected using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients Survey (CRAFT), to model these distributions. Using this sample, we estimate the completeness bias of intrinsic width and scattering measurements, and fit the underlying, de-biased distributions in the host rest-frame. We find no evidence for a down-turn towards high values of the intrinsic distributions of either parameter in the 0.01-40 ms range probed by the data. Rather, the intrinsic scattering distribution at 1 GHz is consistent with a log-uniform distribution above 0.04 ms, while the intrinsic width distribution rises as a Gaussian in log-space in the 0.03-0.3 ms range, and is then log-uniform above that. This is inconsistent with previous works, which assumed that these parameters have lognormal distributions. This confirms that FRB observations are currently strongly width- and scattering-limited, and we encourage FRB searches to be extended to higher values of time-width. It also implies a bias in FRB host galaxy studies, although the form of that bias is uncertain. Finally, we find that our updated width and scattering model - when implemented in the zDM code - produces 10% more FRBs at redshift $z=1$ than at $z=0$ when compared to alternative width/scattering models, highlighting that these factors are important to understand when performing FRB population modelling.

 We utilize a large sample of $\sim$113,000 galaxies ($z < 0.3$) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with high-quality data to compare star formation rates (SFRs) across multiple diagnostic methods and examine their connection to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) strength, indicated by Eddington ratio. Our sample encompassed star-forming (SF), composite, Seyfert, and LINER galaxies. Our analysis utilizes various SFRs indicators, including observed infrared flux ($\rm SFR_{FIR}$) from AKARI/Herschel ($\sim$4,100 sources), the MPA-JHU catalog ($\rm SFR_{Dn4000}$), the ANN catalog ($\rm SFR_{ANN}$), the GSWLC catalog ($\rm SFR_{SED}$ and $\rm SFR_{MIR}$), as well as \OII\ and \Ha\ emission lines ($\rm SFR_{[OII]}$ and $\rm SFR_{H\alpha}$). Within SF galaxies, SFRs measurements from different tracers exhibited differences, with offsets and scatter below 0.26 dex and 0.29 dex, respectively. Moreover, non-SF galaxies (composite, Seyfert, and LINER) displayed discrepancies among SFR tracers, particularly for LINER galaxies, with offsets below 0.86 dex and a scatter of 0.57 dex. Additionally, our findings revealed robust correlations between SFRs and specific SFRs (sSFRs) with Eddington ratios. Eddington ratio exhibited gradual transitions in the (s)SFRs-stellar mass diagrams. Galaxies with high Eddington ratios displayed high star formation activity, similar to blue SF galaxies. Furthermore, we observed decreasing sSFR trends from SF galaxies to composite, Seyfert, and LINER galaxies. Our results may provide insight into our understanding of (s)SFRs traced by different approaches and their connection to AGN activities.

 - **Abstract**
 Small scale extreme ultraviolet (EUV) transient brightenings are observationally abundant and critically important to investigate. Determining whether they share the same physical mechanisms as larger scale flares would have significant implications for the coronal heating problem. A recent study has revealed that quasi periodic pulsations (QPPs), a common feature in both solar and stellar flares, may also be present in EUV brightenings in the quiet Sun (QS). We aim to characterise the properties of EUV brightenings and their associated QPPs in both QS and active regions (ARs) using unprecedented 1 s cadence observations from Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). We applied an automated detection algorithm to analyse statistical properties of EUV brightenings. QPPs were identified using complementary techniques optimised for both stationary and non stationary signals, including a Fourier based method, ensemble empirical mode decomposition, and wavelet analysis. Over 500000 and 300000 brightenings were detected in ARs and QS regions, respectively. Brightenings with lifetimes shorter than 3 s were detected, demonstrating the importance of high temporal resolution. QPP periods span from 5 to over 500 s and show similar distributions between AR and QS. We found a consistent power law scaling, with a weak correlation and a large spread, between QPP period and lifetime in EUV brightenings, solar, and stellar flares. The results support the interpretation that EUV brightenings may represent a small scale manifestation of the same physical mechanisms driving larger solar and stellar flares. Furthermore, the similarity in the statistical properties of EUV brightenings and their associated QPPs between AR and QS regions suggests that the underlying generation mechanisms may not strongly depend on the large scale magnetic environment.

 - **Abstract**
 We report a successful observation of a stellar occultation by asteroid (16583) Oersted, enabling a detailed physical characterization of its shape, spin state, and surface properties. Our goal is to determine the physical parameters of Oersted by combining multi-chord occultation timing, sparse optical photometry, and thermal infrared observations. Such asteroids (size$\sim$20 km) are rarely modeled in this detail due to observational limitations, making Oersted a valuable case study. We applied convex lightcurve inversion to sparse photometric data to derive an initial shape and spin state. This model was then refined and scaled using non-convex shape modeling with the ADAM algorithm, incorporating constraints from the occultation chord profile. Thermophysical modeling based on WISE thermal infrared fluxes was used to determine the asteroid's effective diameter, geometric albedo, and thermal inertia. The non-convex shape model reveals localized surface concavities and provides a size estimate consistent with radiometric measurements. The derived thermal inertia is typical for asteroids of comparable size. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining stellar occultations, photometry, and thermal infrared data for asteroid modeling and highlights the valuable contributions of citizen scientists, who played a key role in capturing the occultation and constraining the asteroid's profile.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation that captures the full, self-consistent evolution from the late inspiral through merger and subsequent recoil of a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) with misaligned spins embedded in an equilibrated circumbinary disk (CBD). Our full numerical simulation follows the final 40 orbits of the inspiral and merger of the binary, following an initial phase of 165 orbits of CBD evolution toward equilibrium. We find that the jets, launched from the minidisks surrounding each black hole, are tilted toward the black hole spin direction close to the individual black holes, but align with the binary's total angular momentum at larger distances. Following the merger, the remnant black hole receives a recoil kick exceeding 1000 km/s. Remarkably, it retains its gravitationally bound CBD as if it were ejected from a galactic nucleus. Furthermore, the jet launched by the recoiling remnant black hole preserves the large-scale orientation established during the late inspiral. We demonstrate that the majority of the luminosity emerges from a region in close proximity to the black hole, suggesting that the accretion disk surrounding the recoiling remnant would remain the most luminous feature postmerger, persisting for long enough to be observable by modern telescopes (hours in the case of LISA sources). These findings introduce a direct, first-principles model for the recoil of supermassive black holes (SMBH) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), offering a comprehensive theoretical basis to support and elucidate both ongoing and future observational efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars primarily form in galactic spiral arms within dense, filamentary molecular clouds. The largest and most elongated of these molecular clouds are referred to as ``bones," which are massive, velocity-coherent filaments (lengths ~20 to >100 pc, widths ~1-2 pc) that run approximately parallel and in close proximity to the Galactic plane. While these bones have been generally well characterized, the importance and structure of their magnetic fields (B-fields) remain largely unconstrained. Through the SOFIA Legacy program FIELDMAPS, we mapped the B-fields of 10 bones in the Milky Way. We found that their B-fields are varied, with no single preferred alignment along the entire spine of the bones. At higher column densities, the spines of the bones are more likely to align perpendicularly to the B-fields, although this is not ubiquitous, and the alignment shows no strong correlation with the locations of identified young stellar objects. We estimated the B-field strengths across the bones and found them to be ~30-150 $\mu$G at pc scales. Despite the generally low virial parameters, the B-fields are strong compared to the local gravity, suggesting that B-fields play a significant role in resisting global collapse. Moreover, the B-fields may slow and guide gas flow during dissipation. Recent star formation within the bones may be due to high-density pockets at smaller scales, which could have formed before or simultaneously with the bones.

 - **Abstract**
 Feedback from Young Massive Clusters (YMCs) is an important driver of galaxy evolution. In the first few Myr, mechanical feedback is dominated by collective effects of the massive stellar winds in the YMC. The mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities of these stars change by orders of magnitude over pre-SN timescales as the massive stars evolve, and mass-loss rates of Cool Supergiant (CSG) stars in particular are uncertain by a factor $\sim~20$ or more. In this work we perform a first study of the time evolution of average cluster wind velocity $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ as a function of stellar metallicity $Z$, assuming single star evolution. We also check the validity of assuming Wolf-Rayet stars dominate the feedback effects of a YMC, as often done when interpreting X-ray and $\gamma$-ray observations, and test how sensitive $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ is to current uncertainties in mass-loss rates. We use pySTARBURST99 to calculate integrated properties of YMCs for $Z$ in the range of $0.0004-0.02$, representing a range of environments from IZw18 to the Galactic Centre. We find that $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ drops off rapidly for sub-LMC $Z$, and we recommend a value of $500-1000\,~\textrm{km~s}^{-1}$ be used in this regime. We show accounting only for WR stars can overestimate $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ by $500-2000\,~\textrm{km~s}^{-1}$ at $Z \geq Z_\text{LMC}$. We also find that different RSG mass-loss assumptions can change the inferred $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ by $\sim1000\,~\textrm{km~s}^{-1}$, highlighting the need for improved observational constraints for RSGs in YMCs.

 - **Abstract**
 Star clusters host the massive stars responsible for feedback in star-forming galaxies. Stellar feedback shapes the interstellar medium (ISM), affecting the formation of future star clusters. To self-consistently capture the interplay between feedback and star formation, a model must resolve the parsec-scale star formation sites and the multiphase ISM. Additionally, the dynamical impact of cosmic rays (CRs) on star formation rates (SFRs) must also be considered. We present the first simulations of the formation of an ensemble of star clusters with dynamically-coupled CRs, near-individual star particles, and a feedback-regulated ISM. We analyze tallbox simulations performed using the CRISP model in the moving-mesh code AREPO. We apply varied implementations of CR transport under the theory of self-confinement. We find that CRs simultaneously reduce the SFR, the power law slope of the cluster mass function, and the cluster formation efficiency. Each simulation is compatible with observations, and CR feedback tends to move results along observed star cluster relations. We see only modest changes in cluster radius and velocity dispersions, but significant differences in the virial parameters. Ultimately, the primary impact of CRs is to reduce SFRs. Lower SFRs imply fewer supernovae, and consequently a lower turbulent energy budget for gas. Star clusters formed in a CR-regulated ISM have lower velocity dispersions, and are therefore more bound under self-gravity. The effective clustering of SNe is unchanged by CRs. Through this work, we demonstrate the predictive power of the CRISP feedback model, despite this idealized setup.

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) play a major role in determining the charge balance of their host environments that include photo-dissociation regions (PDRs) in galaxies, planetary nebulae, and rims of molecular clouds. We aim to investigate the distribution and sizes of charged PAHs across the key zones of the Orion Bar PDR. We employ JWST MIRI-MRS observations of the Orion Bar from the Early Release Science program ''PDRs4All'' and synthetic images in the JWST MIRI filters. We investigate the spatial morphology of the AIBs at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.0 $\mu$m that commonly trace PAH cations, and the neutral PAH-tracing 11.2 $\mu$m AIB, their (relative) correlations, and the relationship with existing empirical prescriptions for AIBs. The 6.2. 7.7, 8.6, 11.0, and 11.2 $\mu$m AIBs are similar in spatial morphology, on larger scales. Analyzing three-feature intensity correlations, two distinct groups emerge: the 8.6 and 11.0 $\mu$m vs. the 6.2 and 7.7 $\mu$m AIBs. We attribute these correlations to PAH size. The 6.2 and 7.7 $\mu$m AIBs trace cationic, medium-sized PAHs. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that the 8.6 $\mu$m AIB is carried by large, compact, cationic PAHs, and the 11.0 $\mu$m AIB's correlation to it implies, so is this band. The 6.2/8.6 and 7.7/8.6 PAH band ratios thus probe PAH size. We conclude that the 6.2/11.2 AIB ratio is the most reliable proxy for charged PAHs, within the cohort. We outline JWST MIRI imaging prescriptions that serve as effective tracers of the PAH ionization fraction as traced. This study showcases the efficacy of the 6-9 $\mu$m AIBs to probe the charge state and size distribution of the emitting PAHs, offering insights into the physical conditions of their host environments. JWST MIRI photometry offers a viable alternative to IFU spectroscopy for characterizing this emission in extended objects.
