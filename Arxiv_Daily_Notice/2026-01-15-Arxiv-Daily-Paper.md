 - **Abstract**
 By the 2040s, the exoplanet field will have moved from the discovery of a few thousand planets to hundreds of thousands, thanks to Gaia DR5, TESS, PLATO, Roman, and their successors. At that stage, the key bottleneck will no longer be planet detection, but our ability to understand how planetary systems form, evolve, and diversify across different stellar and Galactic environments. To address this, we need a large-scale, high-resolution spectroscopic survey of planet-host stars, spanning a broad range of Galactic environments (thin and thick disks, bulge, halo, clusters, associations), and including a well-defined control sample of non-hosts. Such a survey must deliver homogeneous stellar parameters, detailed abundance determinations, ages, and kinematics for tens of thousands of hosts, extending to the faint magnitudes probed by future missions but are beyond the reach of existing and currently planned spectroscopic facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Most stars form in multiple systems, with profound implications in numerous astronomical phenomena intrinsically linked to multiplicity. However, our knowledge about the process on how multiple stellar systems form is incomplete and biased toward nearby molecular clouds forming only low-mass stars, which are unrepresentative of the stellar population in the Galaxy. Most stars form within dense cores in clusters alongside high-mass stars (>8 M$_{\odot}$), as likely the Sun did. Here we report deep ALMA 1.33 mm dust continuum observations at ~160 au spatial resolution, revealing 72 low-mass multiple systems embedded in 23 high-mass cluster-forming regions, as part of the Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA) survey. We find that the companion separation distribution presents a distinct peak at ~1200 au, in contrast to the one at ~4000 au observed in nearby low-mass regions. The shorter fragmentation scale can be explained by considering the higher pressure exerted by the surrounding medium, which is higher than the one in low-mass regions, due to the larger turbulence and densities involved. Because the peak of the companion separation distribution occurs at much larger scales than the expected disk sizes, we argue that the observed fragmentation is produced by turbulent core fragmentation. Contrary as predicted, the multiplicity fraction remains constant as the stellar density increases. We propose that in the extremely dense environments where high-mass stars form, dynamical interactions play an important role in disrupting weakly bound systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) is an ongoing survey mapping thousands of square degrees in the Northern Hemisphere using 56 narrow-band filters, delivering IFU-like photometric data well suited for studying galaxy properties and evolution. As a precursor, the miniJPAS survey observed a 1 deg$^2$ field with the same filter system, providing an ideal testbed for the study of spatially resolved galaxies. In this work, we investigate the resolved stellar population and emission-line properties of 51 miniJPAS galaxies, classified by spectral type (red or blue) and environment (group or field), and assess the role of environment in galaxy evolution. We use the Py2DJPAS pipeline to process the data, homogenise the images to a common PSF, define galactic regions, and extract photo-spectra. Radial profiles are analysed using elliptical annuli spaced by 0.7 R_EFF, combined with an inside-out segmentation to study star formation histories. Stellar population parameters are derived with the Bayesian SED-fitting code BaySeAGal, while artificial neural networks are used to estimate the equivalent widths of the H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [NII], and [OIII] emission lines. We find clear trends in a mass density-colour diagram: denser, redder regions are older, more metal-rich, and have lower specific star formation rates, while bluer, less dense regions show stronger emission lines and higher sSFRs. Red and blue galaxies are well separated in these relations, whereas environmental classification shows no clear distinction. Radial profiles support an inside-out formation scenario, with significant differences between red and blue galaxies but no strong environmental dependence. We suggest that the weak environmental effects may be due to the relatively low stellar masses of the galaxy groups in our sample.

 - **Abstract**
 Several papers have recently calculated the contribution to pulsar timing array overlap reduction functions (ORFs) induced by our peculiar velocity with respect to the rest frame of the stochastic gravitational-wave background. Here we show that a harmonic-space calculation confirms the most recent result. We note that, with the harmonic-space calculation, the ORFs for spin-1 GWs and the correlations with astrometry measurements are also easily obtained.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation and early evolution of protoplanetary disks are governed by a wide variety of physical processes during a gravitational collapse. Observations have begun probing disks in their earliest stages, and have favored the magnetically-regulated disk formation scenario. Disks are also expected to exhibit ellipsoidal morphologies in the early phases, an aspect that has been widely overlooked. We aim to describe the birth and evolution of the disk while accounting for the eccentric motions of fluid parcels. Using 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with ambipolar diffusion, we self-consistently model the collapse of isolated $1~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $3~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ cores to form a central protostar surrounded by a disk. We account for dust dynamics, and employ gas tracer particles to follow the thermodynamical history of fluid parcels. We find that magnetic fields and turbulence drive highly anisotropic accretion onto the disk via dense streamers. This streamer-fed accretion, occurring from the vertical and radial directions, drives vigorous internal turbulence that facilitates efficient angular momentum transport and rapid radial spreading. Crucially, the anisotropic inflow delivers material with an angular momentum deficit that continuously generates and sustains significant disk eccentricity ($e\sim 0.1$). Our results reveal ubiquitous eccentric kinematics in Class 0 disks, with direct implications for disk evolution, planetesimal formation, and the interpretation of cosmochemical signatures in Solar System meteorites.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic centres are highly dynamic regions dominated by a supermassive black hole (BH) surrounded by nuclear star clusters (NSC), molecular gas, and asymmetric matter distributions such as disks or halos. The combined gravitational effects of these components, along with relativistic corrections from the BH's spin, generate strongly nonlinear dynamics and frequent chaotic orbital behaviour. To model this environment, we employ a multipolar expansion potential in which the central compact object is represented by the Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov pseudo-Newtonian potential, effectively capturing spin-dependent features of a Kerr-like BH. The surrounding halo is treated as an axisymmetric, shell-like mass distribution expanded up to third order in multipolar terms to account for realistic asymmetry. Previous studies have mainly explored the influence of multipolar moments and BH spin using Poincare sections, SALI, and related chaos indicators. In this work, we extend these analyses by incorporating stability analysis and basins of convergence to achieve a more complete understanding of the system's dynamics. Stability analysis around equilibrium points provides insight into local behavior, while basins of convergence highlight sensitivity to initial conditions and expose fractal basin boundaries. Our results show that the BH spin significantly reshapes phase space: depending on its magnitude and orientation, it can either amplify chaotic scattering caused by halo asymmetry or stabilize specific orbital families. These findings enhance our understanding of how relativistic spin effects and multipolar mass distributions jointly govern the dynamical architecture of galactic centers.
#### One cloud is not enough: extreme conditions bias chemical abundances in high-redshift galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Since its launch, JWST has opened an unprecedented opportunity to characterise the ionised ISM of high-redshift galaxies using well-established rest-frame UV/optical diagnostics from the local Universe. At the same time, these observations challenge the validity of such classical methods when applied to the extreme environments typical at high redshift. We present an in-depth analysis of the ISM in three representative case studies at $z=2 - 6$ (MARTA 4327, the Sunburst Arc and RXCJ2248-ID) conducted within a multi-cloud photoionisation modelling framework (HOMERUN). We show that even a small fraction of unresolved high-density clumps can contribute more than half of the observed flux of auroral lines, while only negligibly to standard optical density tracers. As a result, $T_{\mathrm{e}}$-method metallicities can be underestimated by $\sim 0.15 - 0.3$ dex, as for MARTA 4327. By modelling rest-frame UV and optical data, we demonstrate that discrepancies between abundances obtained from diagnostics tracing different zones do not necessarily imply chemical inhomogeneities. In RXCJ2248-ID, the disagreement between UV and optical N/O may naturally arise from ionisation and density structure alone. In contrast, we find evidence for genuine chemical stratification in the Sunburst Arc, where a component enriched in nitrogen coexists with a chemically normal one. Finally, we argue that very-high-ionisation lines may be explained within a pure star-formation scenario invoking matter-bounded regions. However, in the case of RXCJ2248-ID, we cannot rule out a minor contribution from an AGN based solely on the observed fluxes. These results indicate that classical diagnostics can be significantly biased in high-redshift galaxies and that self-consistent, physically motivated tools are therefore essential to properly interpret the complex ISM conditions and chemical enrichment in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the interplay between star formation, interstellar medium (ISM) components, and dust properties in NGC 3627 using new NIKA2 1.15 and 2 mm observations from the IMEGIN Large Program. Our goal is to analyze dust and radio emission, decompose contributions in the millimeter-centimeter regime, and explore ISM properties within the galaxy. We perform spectral energy distribution fitting, at both global and spatial scales, using the THEMIS dust model within the HerBIE code, applied to data from 3.4 $\mu$m to 6 cm. We decompose emission into dust, free-free, and synchrotron components, and examine correlations with gas surface density and star formation activity. Additionally, we analyze the small dust grain fraction and its variation across the galaxy. We find $\sim$10% radio emission at 2 mm, peaking at 18% in the southern bar-end, which hosts the highest star formation activity. However, an isolated star-forming region beyond this bar-end is the most efficient, as indicated by its elevated dust production efficiency and effective yield, predicted by our simplistic dust evolution model. The 160 $\mu$m emission shows the strongest correlation with molecular gas, while 1.15 mm better traces the dust mass surface density. Small grains, which make up $\sim$13% of dust mass (2 $\times$ 10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$), are depleted in intense radiation fields, with a notable deficit in the southern tidal tail. ISM properties and chemical evolution indicate that dynamical processes, such as bar-driven gas flows and tidal interactions, are crucial in shaping the galactic structure, influencing star formation efficiency, and dust distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) at ~100 pc scales in a sample of 27 nearby luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) spanning the entire merger sequence. In particular, we study the relations between star-formation (SF) and molecular gas surface density as a function of the interaction stage using two complementary approaches: beam-sized (unresolved, line-of-sight) regions and physically identified molecular gas clumps. To map the distribution of molecular gas we use ALMA CO(2-1) observations, while SF is traced using HST Pa-alpha or Pa-beta images. We derive spatially resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relations for each galaxy. When using beam-sized regions, we find that 67% of galaxies follow a single relation between Sigma_SFR and Sigma_H2. However, in the remaining galaxies, the relation splits into two branches, indicating the presence of a duality in this relation. In contrast, when using physical gas clumps, the duality disappears and all galaxies show a single trend. We also study other ISM/clump properties as a function of the merger stage. We find that isolated galaxies and systems in early stages of interaction exhibit lower amounts of gas and SF. As the merger progresses, however, the amount of gas in the central kpc of the galaxy undergoing the merger increases, along with the SFR, and the slope of the KS relation becomes steeper, indicating an increase in SF efficiency of the gas clumps. Clumps in late-stage mergers are predominantly located at small distances from the nucleus, confirming that most of the activity is concentrated in the central regions. Finally, the relation between the SF efficiency and the boundedness parameter evolves from being roughly flat in the early stages of the merger to becoming positive in the final phases, indicating that clump self-gravity only starts to regulate the SF process between the early- and mid-merger stages.
#### The Quasar Feedback Survey: Revealing the importance of sensitive radio imaging for AGN identification deeper into the radio-quiet regime

 - **Abstract**
 We present new sub-arcsecond ($\sim$0.3-1 arcsec; $\sim$1--3\,kpc) VLA imaging at 1.4\,GHz and 6\,GHz of 29 optically-selected, [O~{\sc iii}] luminous ($L_{\rm [O III]}$ > 10$^{42.1}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$), $z<0.2$ quasars drawn from the expanded Quasar Feedback Survey (QFeedS; with $L_\mathrm{1.4\,GHz} = 10^{22.6}$--10$^{26.3}$\,W\,Hz$^{-1}$). These 29 new objects occupy the low end of the radio-power distribution ($L_\mathrm{1.4\,GHz}$=$10^{22.63}$--10$^{23.45}$\,W\,Hz$^{-1}$) in the QFeedS sample and are nominally `radio quiet'. Despite this, we find widespread evidence of AGN-driven synchrotron activity. Nearly $\sim 31\,$per\,cent exhibit resolved radio structures on $\sim$0.1--20\,kpc scales consistent with compact jets or wind-driven outflows, and $\sim 90\,$per\,cent display steep spectra ($\alpha \lesssim -1$) indicative of optically thin synchrotron emission. Combining morphology, spectral index and brightness-temperature diagnostics, at least $\sim38\,$per\,cent of the sample show clear AGN signatures that cannot be explained by star formation alone. These constitute the first results from the expanded QFeedS (now 71 quasars spanning $\approx 4$ dex in radio power) and demonstrate that compact, low-power jets and AGN shocks are common deep inside the radio-quiet regime. A thorough understanding of feedback processes from quasars, deep into the `radio-quiet' regime, will be obtained by connecting these high resolution radio observations with multi-wavelength observations.
#### The ALMaQUEST Survey XVII: Unveiling Multiple Quenching Pathways in Green Valley Galaxies via Molecular Gas and Quenching Timescale Analyses

 - **Abstract**
 Statistically, green valley (GV) galaxies exhibit lower molecular gas fractions ($f_{gas}$) and reduced star formation efficiency (SFE) compared to star-forming galaxies. However, it remains unclear whether quenching is primarily driven by one factor or results from a combination of mechanisms in individual GV galaxies. In this study, we address this question by examining the spatial distributions of star formation and molecular gas in 28 GVs selected from the ALMaQUEST survey and additional literature samples. For each galaxy, we identify regions with suppressed specific star formation rate (sSFR) and measure $\Delta f_{gas}$ and $\Delta$SFE-offsets from the resolved scaling relations of the star-forming main sequence galaxies. By comparing the fraction of regions with negative $\Delta f_{gas}$ and $\Delta$SFE, we classify 35.7$\pm$13.2\% (57.1$\pm$17.9\%) of GV galaxies as $f_{gas}$-driven, 39.3$\pm$14.0\% (39.3$\pm$14.0\%) as SFE-driven, and 25.0$\pm$10.6\% (3.6$\pm$3.6\%) as mixed mode when adopting a fixed (variable) CO-to-$\rm H_{2}$ conversion factor ($\alpha_{CO}$). These results indicate that GVs undergo quenching through multiple pathways. As sSFR decreases from the main sequence to the green valley, we observe a transition toward predominantly SFE-driven quenching, possibly linked to internal processes such as morphological quenching or AGN activity. We further estimate the quenching timescale ($\tau_{decay}$), defined as the time from the peak SFR to 1/e (approximately 37\%) of its value, using integrated MaNGA spectra. SFE-driven quenching is typically associated with short $\tau_{decay}$ , while $f_{gas}$-driven quenching shows a broader range. Overall, 75\% of GVs exhibit $\tau_{decay}$ shorter than 1 Gyr, suggesting that quenching in most GVs proceeds rapidly, challenging purely slow-quenching scenarios like starvation.

 - **Abstract**
 Topographic models are essential for characterizing planetary surfaces and for inferring underlying geological processes. Nevertheless, meter-scale topographic data remain limited, which constrains detailed planetary investigations, even for the Moon, where extensive high-resolution orbital images are available. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) exploit single-view imagery, constrained by low-resolution topography, for fast and flexible reconstruction of fine-scale topography. However, their robustness and general applicability across diverse lunar landforms and illumination conditions remain insufficiently explored. In this study, we build upon our previously proposed DL framework by incorporating a more robust scale recovery scheme and extending the model to polar regions under low solar illumination conditions. We demonstrate that, compared with single-view shape-from-shading methods, the proposed DL approach exhibits greater robustness to varying illumination and achieves more consistent and accurate topographic reconstructions. Furthermore, it reliably reconstructs topography across lunar features of diverse scales, morphologies, and geological ages. High-quality topographic models are also produced for the lunar south polar areas, including permanently shadowed regions, demonstrating the method's capability in reconstructing complex and low-illumination terrain. These findings suggest that DL-based approaches have the potential to leverage extensive lunar datasets to support advanced exploration missions and enable investigations of the Moon at unprecedented topographic resolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the structural parameters of strange quark stars (SQS) under the influence of strong magnetic fields and varying rotational frequencies. The equation of state is computed using the MIT bag model with a density-dependent bag constant and considering the Landau quantization effect regarding the strong magnetic fields up to $5\times10^{17}\,$G in the interior of SQS. Employing the LORENE library, we calculate the structural parameters under different magnetic field strengths and rotational frequencies. Our models are compared in terms of maximum gravitational mass, deformation parameter, binding energy, and compactness. Our equation of state model demonstrates that the gravitational masses are higher than those computed using a MIT bag model with a fixed bag constant. We find the gravitational masses beyond $2.3 \,M_\odot$, which are compatible with the masses of observed compact objects, such as the ``black widow'' pulsar \emph{PSR J0952-0607}, and the \emph{GW190814} event detected by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration. The deformation parameter and maximum gravitational mass of SQS are characterized by fitted functions accounting for variations in both magnetic field strength and rotational frequency. We find the maximum deformation parameter of 1.55 and the maximum gravitational mass of $2.8\, M_\odot$ in the fast-rotating strongly magnetized model.

 - **Abstract**
 Formation of a rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized neutron star (NS) may occur in various classes of core-collapse events. If the NS injects an amount of energy comparable to the explosion energy of the accompanying supernova (SN) before the SN ejecta becomes transparent, the nascent NS wind bubble can overtake the outer ejecta and undergo a blowout driven by hydrodynamic instabilities. Based on multidimensional numerical studies, we construct a minimal semi-analytic framework to follow the post-blowout dynamics and radiative evolution, map the blowout conditions by scanning the ejecta and NS parameters, and compute survey-ready multi-band light curves. For stripped-envelope SNe with an ejecta mass of $M_\mathrm{ej} \sim 10\,M_\odot$ and an explosion energy of $E_\mathrm{sn} \sim 10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}$, blowout occurs for NSs with magnetic field strengths of $B_{\mathrm{dip}} \gtrsim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{G}$ and spin periods of $P_\mathrm{NS} \lesssim \mathrm{a\ few}\,\mathrm{ms}$. Relatively weak-field cases with $B_\mathrm{dip} \lesssim 10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}$ produce luminous double-peaked UV/optical light curves, as observed in the superluminous SN LSQ14bdq, while stronger-field cases with $B_\mathrm{dip} \gtrsim 10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}$ result in hypernovae preceded by X-ray blowout precursors. We also examine weaker and lower-mass SN explosions representing ultra-stripped SNe and accretion- or merger-induced collapse events, in which blowout is more readily achieved over a broader range of NS parameters, producing fast X-ray transients with durations of $ 10^{2\mbox{--}4}\,\mathrm{s}$ and peak luminosities of $10^{42\mbox{--}48}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. Our results encourage coordinated UV, optical, and X-ray observations which constrain the formation of the most energetic NSs in the universe.
