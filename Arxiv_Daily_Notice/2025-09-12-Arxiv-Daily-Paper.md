 - **Abstract**
 Future lunar missions will depend on an internationally agreed upon timescale that remains accurate under the Moon's unique gravitational environment and its orbital dynamics. This thesis investigates the proposed Lunar Coordinate Time (TCL), derived analogously to Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) and thus aligned with current IAU proposals. We first formalise the TCL transformation and quantify its characteristics from solar system simulations. Next, we compute stationary surface-clock drifts caused by gravitational redshift and the Moon's changing orientation parameters, evaluating how accurate atomic clocks deployed on the surface of the Moon (much like for ESA's proposed NovaMoon mission) would have to be to measure these effects. Finally, we simulate relativistic proper time for ESA's Moonlight navigation satellites, identifying average drift and harmonic variations, to better understand the system that will comprise and enable a Lunar PNT (Positioning, Navigation and Timing) architecture. These kinds of investigations are an essential step toward a sustained internationally cooperative operation at the lunar south pole and beyond.

 - **Abstract**
 We present FrankenBlast, a customized and improved version of the Blast web application. FrankenBlast associates transients to their host galaxies, performs host photometry, and runs a innovative SED fitting code to constrain host stellar population properties--all within minutes per object. We test FrankenBlast on 14,432 supernovae (SNe), ~half of which are spectroscopically-classified, and are able to constrain host properties for 9262 events. When contrasting the host stellar masses ($M_*$), specific star formation rates (sSFR), and host dust extinction ($A_V$) between spectroscopically and photometrically-classified SNe Ia, Ib/c, II, and IIn, we determine that deviations in these distributions are primarily due to misclassified events contaminating the photometrically-classified sample. We further show that the higher redshifts of the photometrically-classified sample also force their $M_*$ and sSFR distributions to deviate from those of the spectroscopically-classified sample, as these properties are redshift-dependent. We compare host properties between spectroscopically-classified SN populations and determine if they primarily trace $M_*$ or SFR. We find that all SN populations seem to both depend on $M_*$ and SFR, with SNe II and IIn somewhat more SFR-dependent than SNe Ia and Ib/c, and SNe Ia more $M_*$-dependent than all other classes. We find the difference in the SNe Ib/c and II hosts the most intriguing and speculate that SNe Ib/c must be more dependent on higher $M_*$ and more evolved environments for the right conditions for progenitor formation. All data products and FrankenBlast are publicly available, along with a developing FrankenBlast version intended for Rubin Observatory science products.

 - **Abstract**
 The void galaxy cross correlation function is a powerful tool to extract cosmological information. Through the void galaxy cross correlation function, cosmic voids, the underdense regions in the galaxy distribution, are used for refined deductions of the Universe's content by correcting apparent geometric distortions. This study proposes a novel procedure for optimally extracting the Alcock Paczynski, AP, signal from cosmic voids through a cosmological reconstruction technique. Employing cosmological reconstruction, specifically using the Zel'dovich approximation, we estimate the true positions of galaxies from their redshift space locations, reducing distortions introduced by peculiar velocities. Unlike previous analyses, we identify voids and measure the void galaxy cross correlation function directly in reconstructed space. This approach enables us, for the first time, to include in our analysis small nonlinear voids, typically discarded in previous studies, thus enhancing the statistical power of void studies and significantly improving their cosmological constraining power. Reconstruction is particularly effective even at small scales for voids, due to their clean and dynamically simple environment. This ability to recover information encoded on small scales significantly enhances the precision of the analysis, leading to a 23 % improvement in the constraints on the AP parameters compared to previous methods where the analysis is performed in redshift space and, consequently, to a better estimate of the derived cosmological parameters. Our analysis also includes a comprehensive set of consistency checks, demonstrating its robustness. We expect this methodology to yield a substantial gain in constraining power when applied to data from modern large scale structure surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star is disrupted by the tidal forces of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), producing bright multi-wavelength flares. Among these events, AT2020mot has so far exhibited the highest recorded optical polarisation, with tidal shocks proposed as the primary source of its polarised emission. We present a comprehensive analysis of 13 TDEs with available polarimetric observations, aiming to determine whether the unusually high polarisation of AT2020mot stems from unique physical processes or arises from mechanisms shared by other TDEs. We present new optical polarisation measurements of TDEs obtained from multiple ground-based telescopes, combining them with optical, UV, and X-ray light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Swift observatory, respectively. We derive intrinsic TDE properties, such as SMBH and stellar masses, using MOSFiT and TDEMass, and compare them with the ones of the sample population. Our population study reveals that AT2020mot agrees with the broader TDE sample in most physical properties, including blackbody temperature, luminosity, and rise timescales. However, its optical polarisation degree is exceptionally high compared to the low or undetected polarisation observed in other events. Additionally, AT2020mot appears to have an elevated column density from our MOSFiT fits, suggesting a more complex environment than is typically assumed. We conclude that although AT2020mot fits well within the general TDE population in terms of global characteristics, its extraordinarily high polarisation and higher column density challenge current models based purely on shock or reprocessing mechanisms. More extensive, time-resolved polarimetric monitoring of newly discovered TDEs will be critical to determine whether AT2020mot represents an outlier or the extreme end of a continuum of TDE properties.

 - **Abstract**
 FRBs constitute a unique probe of various astrophysical and cosmological environments via their characteristic dispersion and rotation (RM) measures that encode information about the ionized gas traversed by the FRB sightlines. In this work, we analyse observed RM measured for 14 localized FRBs at $0.05 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.5$, to infer total magnetic fields in various galactic environments. Additionally, we calculate $f_{\rm gas}$ - the average fraction of halo baryons in the ionized CGM. We build a spectroscopic dataset of FRB foreground galaxy halos, acquired with VLT/MUSE and FLIMFLAM survey. We develop a novel Bayesian algorithm and use it to correlate the individual intervening halos with the observed RM. This approach allows us to disentangle the magnetic fields present in various environments traversed by the FRB. Our analysis yields the first direct FRB constraints on the strength of magnetic fields in the ISM and halos of the FRB host galaxies, as well as in halos of foreground galaxies. We find that the average magnetic field in the ISM of FRB hosts is $B_{\rm host}^{\rm local} = 5.44^{+1.13}_{-0.87}\mu{\rm G}$. Additionally, we place upper limits on average magnetic field in FRB host halos, $B_{\rm host}^{\rm halo} < 4.81\mu{\rm G}$, and in foreground intervening halos, $B_{\rm f/g}^{\rm halo} < 4.31\mu{\rm G}$. Moreover, we estimate the average fraction of cosmic baryons inside $10 \lesssim \log_{10} \left( M_{\rm halo} / M_{\odot}\right) \lesssim 13.1$ halos $f_{\rm gas} = 0.45^{+0.21}_{-0.19}$. We find that the magnetic fields inferred in this work are in good agreement with previous measurements. In contrast to previous studies that analysed FRB RMs and have not considered contributions from the halos of the foreground and/or FRB host galaxies, we show that they can contribute a non-negligible amount of RM and must be taken into account when analysing future FRB samples.

 - **Abstract**
 The typical galaxy in the local universe is expected to be in a self-regulated quasi-equilibrium, displaying a settled morphology that falls within the Hubble Sequence. The Arp and Arp-Madore catalogs are filled with striking examples of galaxies that defy these expectations, making them useful targets for studying the astrophysics that controls dramatic, but short-lived, episodes of disequilibrium that mark galaxies' evolution. In this paper, we greatly expand the available Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of galaxies drawn from the Arp and Arp-Madore catalogs. We present new optical F606W images and point-source photometry for 216 systems, whose sizes are well-matched to the Advanced Camera for Surveys' (ACS) wide field of view. Essentially none of the sample had been previously observed with Hubble. The resulting images display rich morphologies, revealing a variety of massive stars, HII regions, stellar clusters, dust lanes, tidal tails, backlit galaxies, and occasional chance superpositions. We provide a pedagogical guide for interpreting highly-resolved optical galaxy images, which has general application beyond this atlas. The atlas images also provide a superb starting point for more detailed studies with high-resolution imaging in other wavelengths, and spectroscopy to track kinematics and the interstellar medium (ISM). Areas of obvious scientific relevance include feedback and star formation in merging and interacting galaxies, resolved stellar populations at the extremes of stellar density, the properties of young massive stars and stellar clusters, the physics of the cold ISM and dust, and stellar and gas dynamics.
#### On the origin of the dominant waves in the extended solar corona

 - **Abstract**
 The extended solar corona at 10-30 solar radii is essentially devoid of all waves below 100 kHz other than triggered ion acoustic waves (TIAW), which consist of a low frequency electromagnetic wave at a frequency of a few Hz coupled to one or more electrostatic waves at a few hundred Hz, such that the amplitudes of the higher frequency waves peak at a fixed phase of each low frequency wave period. All the waves in a TIAW event travel at the same phase speed, which is found to be 150 km s (the ion acoustic speed was about 100 km s). It has not been possible to explain the TIAW as a resonant wave-wave interaction, so a non-resonant interaction has been considered in which the loss of energy by the low frequency wave is used to both heat the electrons and grow the higher frequency waves. Evidence in support of this explanation is described and a PIC simulation that discusses this process is summarized. This interplay between a pair of waves, mediated by modifications of plasma parameters and energy conversion, represents a significant nonlinear process in plasma physics, the study of which will deepen the understanding of energy transfer, wave generation, and plasma dynamics in diverse astrophysical environments.

 - **Abstract**
 With the discovery of pulsations in some of the ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs), it is quite clear that most of the ULXs harbor either a neutron star or a stellar mass black hole as a compact object accreting at super-Eddington rates. In spite of having such a high accretion rate, the reprocessed emission in the ULX sources is quite meagre compared to that observed in Galactic X-ray binaries, except for some absorption lines in the winds. In this work, we investigate the extent of reprocessed emission in ULXs using three diagnostics: (i) searches for Fe $\rm K\alpha$ lines in bright well-known ULXs and Ultra luminous X-ray Pulsars (ULXPs), (ii) evolution of hardness ratio around the eclipse transitions in the eclipsing ULXs, and (iii) the flux ratio between eclipse and out-of-eclipse (OOE) phases in eclipsing ULXs. We placed the most stringent constraints to date on the upper limits on EW of the iron line, 11--20 eV. Furthermore, we have not observed any significant changes in the hardness ratio during the ingress or egress, while in Galactic eclipsing X-ray binaries, an increase in the hardness ratio is observed during the transitions. Finally, the reprocessing efficiency (eclipse to OOE flux ratio) is found to be larger in ULXs compared to Galactic eclipsing X-ray binaries. Based on these results, we discuss the possibility of a metal-poor or highly ionized environment surrounding the ULXs, which suppresses reprocessed emission features.

 - **Abstract**
 The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration recently reported GW231123, a black hole merger with total mass of around 190-265 solar mass. This event adds to the growing evidence of "lite" intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) discoveries of post-merger black holes >100 solar mass. GW231123 posed several data analysis challenges owing to waveform-model systematics and presence of noise artifacts called glitches. We present the first comprehensive machine learning analysis to further validate this event, strengthen its astrophysical inference, and characterize instrumental noise in its vicinity. Our approach uses a combination of tools tailored for specific analyses: GW-Whisper, an adaptation of OpenAI's audio transformer, ArchGEM, a Gaussian mixture model-based soft clustering and density approximation software and AWaRe, a convolutional autoencoder. We identify the data segment containing the merger with >70% confidence in both detectors and verify its astrophysical origin. We then characterize the scattered light glitch around the event, providing the first physically interpretable parameters for the glitch. We also reconstruct the real waveforms from the data with slightly better agreement to model-agnostic reconstructions than to quasi-circular models, hinting at possible astrophysics beyond current waveform families (such as non-circular orbits or environmental imprints). Finally, by demonstrating high-fidelity waveform reconstructions for simulated mergers with total masses between 100-1000 solar mass, we show that our method can confidently probe the IMBH regime. Our integrated framework offers a powerful complementary tool to traditional pipelines for rapid, robust analysis of massive, glitch-contaminated events.
#### Magnetic White Dwarf -- M Dwarf Binaries in Pre-polar Phase as Special Population of Long-Period Radio Transients

 - **Abstract**
 Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a new class of coherent radio sources with periods ranging from minutes to hours. Recently, two LPT sources, ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704-37, with periods of 2-3 hours has been confirmed to originate from white dwarf (WD) -- M dwarf (MD) binaries. In this work, we propose that at least some LPTs originate from the magnetic WD -- MD binaries in the pre-polar phase. The asynchronism between the WD's rotation and the binary's orbital motion allows for the unipolar-inductor mechanism or magnetosphere interaction to operate and accelerate radiating particles, with the dominant process depending on the magnetic moment ratio of the two stars. Under asynchronism condition, both the peak flux and the polarization of radio pulses will be modulated by the beat period. The pre-polar phase characterized by an extremely low accretion rate provides the relatively clean magnetospheric environment necessary for a loss-cone-driven maser (LCDM) mechanism to operate, producing the LPT emission. The observed pulse duty cycle of $10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ is attributed to a beaming effect modulated by the binary's magnetic geometry. Furthermore, the magnetized environment of a WD--MD binary is conducive to Faraday conversion with weak coupling, which implies that the polarization state of LPTs should vary significantly at different periods. Finally, we predict that LPTs from WD--MD binaries should exhibit a period distribution following $f_P(P)dP \propto P^{-(1.67-2.33)}dP$ and a luminosity function described by $f_L(L)dL \propto L^{-(1.80-2.67)}dL$, which can be tested by the future large sample.

 - **Abstract**
 An international team of researchers has come together to undertake an ultra-broadband exploration of the deep radio sky. The superMIGHTEE project combines data from the MIGHTEE project, using the precursor Square Kilometre Array (SKA) MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, with observations from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in India to produce deep images at several $\mu$Jy sensitivity over a frequency range of 200 MHz--2.5 GHz, with an angular resolution of a few arcseconds. This paper describes the initial superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release, comprising total intensity continuum images covering a total of 9.9 deg$^2$ at 650 MHz and 6.9 deg$^2$ at 400 MHz in the XMM-LSS, COSMOS, and E-CDFS deep fields. The associated radio source catalogs include 27,101 sources at 650 MHz and 10,946 sources at 400 MHz. The redshift distribution of the sources extends to $z\sim4$ with a median value of $z=1$. An overview of the broadband spectra of the sources, in combination with the MeerKAT MIGHTEE 1280 MHz data, reveals a clear change in spectral properties at the transition from an active galactic nuclei-dominated population to a population dominated by star-forming galaxies at flux densities of a few mJy. At higher frequencies, the star-forming galaxy population exhibits an optically thin synchrotron spectral index indicative of energy injection from supernovae. At lower frequencies, the spectra flatten significantly with decreasing flux density, and the fraction of sources with peaked spectra increases. This is the first superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release. Subsequent releases will include spectropolarimetric and spectral line image cubes, as well as images at lower frequencies. The goal of the superMIGHTEE ultra-wideband dataset is to enhance our understanding of the evolution of active galactic nuclei and star-forming galaxies over cosmic time, (abridged).
#### High-resolution simulations of disc tearing in the GW Orionis triple system

 - **Abstract**
 The disc around the pre-main-sequence triple star system GW Orionis is known from observations to be warped and broken. Theoretical modelling has produced conflicting results regarding the mechanism responsible for breaking the disc. Analytical predictions for the measured parameters of GW Ori suggest the disc is only marginally stable to tearing. We present new high-resolution simulations of GW Ori that replicate the wavelike regime expected in thick, low-turbulence protoplanetary discs for the first time to settle this question. Using the most optimistic values of misalignment and stellar mass ratio allowed by observational constraints, we find that the GW Ori disc can be torn by stellar torques alone, without need for an embedded planet. Even if the disc retains a smooth warp in simulations with similar parameters, it is likely that any small perturbation in the density or temperature structure could cause the disc to break. The new simulations rule out retrograde disc rotation relative to the stellar orbits and tentatively suggest the thicker ($h/r = 0.04$) disc better matches observations. Going forward, we should take care to ensure models of GW Ori and similar systems appropriately represent the propagation of warps. Additionally, analytical predictions are derived from idealized (and often massless) discs and it is useful to assess how each observed disc might deviate from those assumptions, especially in the context of a young and active star-forming neighbourhood.

 - **Abstract**
 The process of galaxy evolution over cosmic time is not yet fully understood, since there is a debate on the impact of galaxy collisions on the star formation and metallicity. The local environment of the galaxy mergers could also have a large impact on the evolution of the galaxies, but it has not yet been possible to examine it in detail. Modern simulations with larger capacity, including the newest physical knowledge and new observations with JWST, help us to answer these questions. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation, we processed the catalogue data and the merger tree files of the TNG300-1 simulation. We calculated the galaxies average star formation rate (SFR) and mass at redshifts between 0 < z < 15. We investigated the environment of galaxy mergers, with the focus on the local density, and also examined how the SFR changes in merging galaxies. We compared our findings with JWST results and highlighted differences in the star formation rate density (SFRD) history between the models and observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The fundamental process of star formation in galaxies involves the interplay between the fueling of star formation via molecular gas and the feedback from recently formed massive stars. This process, by which galaxies evolve, is also closely connected to the intrinsic properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). To study the role that different molecular and atomic phases of the ISM play in star formation, and to characterize their physical conditions, we zoom into our nearest neighboring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; 50 kpc). The LMC offers a view of the ISM and star formation conditions in a low metallicity environment similar to, in that regard, the epoch of the peak of star formation in the earlier universe. We present an unprecedentedly detailed analysis of a well-known star-forming regions (SFRs) at a spatial resolution of a few pc. We mapped a 610pcx260pc region in the LMC molecular ridge in [CII] and the [OIII] using the FIFI-LS instrument on the SOFIA telescope. We compare the data with the distribution of the CO (2-1) emission from ALMA, the modeled TIR luminosity as well as Spitzer/MIPS continuum and Halpha. We also provide a detailed description of the observing strategy and the data reduction. We find that [CII] and [OIII] emission is associated with the SFRs in the molecular ridge, but also extends throughout the mapped region, not obviously associated with ongoing star formation. The CO emission is clumpier than the [CII] emission and we find plentiful [CII] present where there is little CO emission, possibly holding important implications for CO-dark gas. We find a clear trend of the [CII]/TIR ratio decreasing with increasing TIR. This suggests a strong link between the [CII]-deficit and the local physical conditions instead of global properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf-dwarf galaxy encounters are a key aspect of galaxy evolution as they can ignite or temporarily suppress star formation in dwarfs and can lead to dwarf mergers. However, the frequency and impact of dwarf encounters remain poorly constrained due to limitations of spectroscopic studies, e.g. surface-brightness incompleteness of optical studies and poor spatial resolution of single-dish neutral hydrogen (HI) surveys. We aim to quantify the frequency of isolated gas-rich dwarf galaxy multiples using the untargeted, interferometric Apertif HI survey and study the impact of the interaction on star formation rates of galaxies as a function of the on-sky separation. Our parent dwarf sample consists of 2481 gas-rich galaxies with stellar masses 10^6 < M_* / M_Sun < 5*10^9, for which we identify close companions based on projected separation (r_p) and systemic velocity difference (Del_V_sys). We explore both constant thresholds for r_p and Del_V_sys corresponding to 150 kpc and 150 km/s on all galaxies in our sample, and mass-dependent thresholds based on a stellar-to-halo mass relation. We find the average number of companions per dwarf in our sample to be 13% (20%) when considering mass-dependent (constant) thresholds. In the stellar mass regime of 2*10^8 < M_* / M_Sun < 5*10^9, we find a three times higher frequency (11.6%) of dwarf companions than previously determined from optical spectroscopic studies, highlighting the power of HI for finding dwarf multiples. Furthermore, we find evidence for an increase in star formation rates (SFRs) of close dwarf galaxy pairs of galaxies with similar stellar masses.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive Bayesian spectral analysis of the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47 during its 2022 outburst, using simultaneous \textit{NICER} and \textit{NuSTAR} observations. Using the traditional frequentist approach, we build our model combining reflection spectroscopy with continuum fitting techniques and analyse the data. In the Bayesian framework, we jointly constrain the black hole's spin, mass, inclination, and distance within a unified framework. Employing nested sampling, we capture parameter degeneracies and rigorously propagate both statistical and systematic uncertainties. Our results yield robust and precise spin measurements from both approaches. Our Bayesian analysis fetches spin $a_*= 0.93_{-0.04}^{+0.05}$, mass $M_{\rm BH} = 9.0_{-2.0}^{+2.0} \, M_\odot$, distance $d_{\rm BH} = 10.5_{-1.2}^{+1.3}$~kpc, and inclination angle $i=53.8_{-1.3}^{+1.3}$~deg. It also demonstrates the power of Bayesian inference in fetching valuable insights into the complex physics of black hole accretion and enabling high-confidence measurements of fundamental parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the relationship between quasars and close companion galaxies using photometry and spectroscopy from the large data set of the SDSS DR16 survey. From the SDSS-QSO catalog of quasars, we selected objects with 0.1 < z < 0.35 and absolute magnitude M(r) <-21.3. For all these targets, we searched for candidate companion galaxies that have a projected distance from the target < 700 kpc and a radial velocity difference from the QSO DeltaV < 1000 km/sec. We find that in 447 QSO at least one companion galaxy is associated. A total of 691 associated galaxies are found in these QSO fields. In the majority of them there is just one associated galaxy but in few cases, many companions are also discovered and in two cases the QSO is found in rich galaxy environments. The possible contamination due to a chance projection of the companion galaxies is found less than 5%. Based on the available data we expect on average to find \sim2 associated companion galaxies for each QSO. A small fraction (13%) of the companion galaxies exhibits [OII] emission lines as signature of recent star formation. However a similar fraction (16%) of unassociated galaxies in the same QSO fields show [OII] emission. This study suggests that there is no significant link between the presence of these close companion galaxies or the signature of recent star formation and the QSO nuclear activity.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the build-up and survival of angular momentum in the stellar disc using a statistical suite of cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies. Our results show that stellar kinematics at $z=0$ rarely recover the true times of disc spin-up, due to the disruptive impact of massive radial merger events. The proto-disc (i.e. Aurora) and kicked-up disc stars (the Splash) become indistinguishable at low metallicities, and the local fraction of kicked-up disc stars remains $<20$ per cent even in the case of major mergers. In contrast, observations from Gaia and legacy surveys reveal that Galactic $\alpha$-rich populations as old as $\tau=13.5\,\rm{Gyr}$ show significant rotation, with median $\eta > 0.75$. This places strong constraints on the merger ratio between the proto-Milky Way and its last significant merger (Gaia-Sausage Enceladus, GSE), favouring values of $\lesssim 1:7$. We present the age-metallicity relation for the stellar halo and estimate the interaction epoch at $\tau_{\rm{spin\text{-}up}}\simeq\tau_{\rm{GSE}}\sim11\,\rm{Gyr}$. We note an abrupt dearth of halo and Splash stars after a lookback time of $10\,\rm{Gyr}$, marking the end of the merger interaction. Finally, we show that Globular Clusters in the metallicity range $-0.8<\rm{[Fe/H]}<-0.3$ align with a formation time of $\tau_{\rm{starburst}}\sim11\,\rm{Gyr}$, which we interpret as a signature of a starburst triggered by the first pericentric interaction of the GSE. This is remarkable corroboration between our GSE interaction and starburst times of $\tau_{\rm GSE}=\tau_{\rm starburst} \sim 11\,$Gyr.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest and densest stellar systems in the Universe, yet how they form remains a mystery. Here we present a suite of cosmological simulations in which both dark-matter-free GCs and dark-matter-rich dwarf galaxies naturally emerge in the Standard Cosmology. We show that these objects inhabit distinct locations in the size-luminosity plane and that they have similar ages, age spread, metallicity and metallicity spread to globulars and dwarfs in the nearby Universe. About half of our simulated globulars form by means of regular star formation near the centres of their host dwarf, with the rest forming further out, triggered by mergers. The latter are more tidally isolated and more likely to survive to the present day. Finally, our simulations predict the existence of a new class of object that we call 'globular-cluster-like dwarfs' (GCDs). These form from a single, self-quenching, star-formation event in low-mass dark-matter halos at high redshift and have observational properties intermediate between globulars and dwarfs. We identify several dwarfs in our Galaxy, such as Reticulum II (refs. 2-4), that could be in this new class. If so, they promise unprecedented constraints on dark-matter models and new sites to search for metal-free stars.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST NIRCam and MIRI photometry of NGC 602, a low-metallicity young star cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud, reveals an extended mid-infrared bright emission feature designated as MZS-1. This feature is prominent between 10 and 25.5 microns, but is extremely faint at 7.7 microns and entirely undetected at shorter wavelengths. MZS-1 exhibits an elliptical morphology with a major axis of approximately 8 arcseconds and a minor axis of about 4 arcseconds. Its elongated shape and multiple emission peaks in the two-dimensional flux map suggest a group of deeply embedded sources with blackbody-like temperatures ranging from 100 K to 140 K. SED fitting using the Robitaille 2017 model grids identifies these sources as Stage I young stellar objects (YSOs) with masses below approximately 3 solar masses and a total stellar mass of the protocluster of about 300 solar masses (based on a Salpeter IMF). The low YSO masses are consistent with their absence in Spitzer-based catalogs due to sensitivity limits. By revealing a deeply embedded, low-mass protocluster invisible in previous surveys, this work highlights JWST's unparalleled resolution and sensitivity in uncovering the earliest stages of low-mass cluster formation in the metal-poor regime.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an investigation into the quenching of simulated galaxies across cosmic time, honing in on the role played by both intrinsic and environmental mechanisms at different epochs. In anticipation of VLT-MOONRISE, the first wide-field spectroscopic galaxy survey to target cosmic noon, this work provides clear predictions to compare to the future observations. We investigate the quenching of centrals, high-mass satellites, and low-mass satellites from two cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: IllustrisTNG and EAGLE. Satellites are split according to bespoke mass thresholds, designed to separate environmental and intrinsic quenching mechanisms. To determine the best parameter for predicting quiescence, we apply a Random Forest classification analysis for each galaxy class at each epoch. The Random Forest classification determines supermassive black hole mass as the best predictor of quiescence in centrals and high-mass satellites. Alternatively, the quenching of low-mass satellites is best predicted by group halo mass, at all epochs. Additionally, we investigate the evolution in the dependence of the quenched fraction with various parameters, revealing a more complex picture. There is strong evidence for the rejuvenation of star formation from z = 2 to z = 0 in EAGLE, but not in IllustrisTNG. The starkest discrepancy between simulations rests in the mass threshold analysis. While IllustrisTNG predicts the existence of environmentally quenched satellites visible within the survey limits of MOONRISE, EAGLE does not. Hence, MOONRISE will provide critical data that is needed to evaluate current models, and constrain future models, of quenching processes.
#### Large-scale variability in macroturbulence driven by pulsations in the rapidly rotating massive star Zeta Oph from high-cadence ESPRESSO spectroscopy and TESS photometry

 - **Abstract**
 Despite their importance, the dynamical properties of massive stars remain poorly understood. Rotation is a key driver of internal mixing and angular momentum transport, significantly influencing massive star evolution. However, constraining rotation from spectroscopy is challenging, as spectral lines often exhibit excess broadening beyond rotation. The origin of this additional broadening, typically attributed to large-scale velocity fields and commonly referred to as macroturbulence, remains uncertain and unconstrained. Here, we present the combined analysis of TESS photometry and rapid time-series spectroscopy using the high-resolution ESPRESSO instrument at the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory for the rapidly rotating and pulsating massive star Zeta Ophiuchi. Leveraging excellent temporal coverage, our analysis demonstrates that pulsation-induced variability leads to peak-to-peak scatter as large as 88 km/s in the observed macroturbulent velocity time series. We also demonstrate that time-averaged macroturbulent velocities are spectral line specific and can exceed 100 km/s . Furthermore, the macroturbulent velocities from shorter integration times are systematically lower than those derived from stacked spectra mimicking longer exposure times typically needed for fainter stars. These results highlight the role of pulsations in driving variable macroturbulence in massive stars, while also pointing to a potential bias in spectroscopic estimates of macroturbulence for fainter massive stars.
