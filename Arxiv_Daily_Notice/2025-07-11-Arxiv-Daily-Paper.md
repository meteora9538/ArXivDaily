 - **Abstract**
 The polarization of starlight and thermal dust emission from aligned non-spherical grains provides a powerful tool for tracing magnetic field morphologies and strengths in diffuse interstellar medium to star-forming regions, and constraining dust grain properties and their alignment mechanisms. However, the physics of grain alignment is not yet fully understood. The alignment based on RAdiative Torques (RATs), known as RAT Alignment or RAT-A mechanism is the most acceptable mechanism. In this work, we investigate the grain alignment mechanisms in F13 (F13N and F13C) and F13S filamentary regions of the Cocoon Nebula (IC 5146) using polarized thermal dust emission observations from JCMT/POL-2 at 850 $\mu$m. We find that the polarization fraction decreases with increasing total intensity and gas column density in each region, termed as polarization hole. We investigate for any role of magnetic field tangling on the observed polarization hole by estimating the polarization angle dispersion function. Our study finds that the polarization hole is not significantly influenced by magnetic field tangling, but majorly due to decrease in RAT alignment efficiency of grains in denser regions. To test whether RAT-A mechanism can reproduce the observational results, we estimate minimum alignment size of grains using RAT theory. Our study finds strong evidence for RAT-A mechanism that can explain the polarization hole. We also find potential hints that the observed higher polarization fractions in some regions of F13 filament can be due to combined effects of both suprathermal rotation by RATs and enhanced magnetic relaxation, supporting the Magnetically-Enhanced RAT (M-RAT) mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 Comets are primitive remnants of the early Solar System whose composition offers fundamental clues to their formation and evolution. High-resolution, broad-wavelength spectroscopy is crucial for identifying volatile species and constraining the physical conditions within the coma. We aim to characterize the gas composition and physical environment of the newly discovered comet C/2025 N1 through optical and near-infrared spectroscopy. We used a medium-resolution spectrum of comet C/2025 N1 with X-shooter at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT), covering the 300-2500 nm wavelength range. Standard data reduction and flux calibration were applied. It corresponds to a spectral slope at least a factor of $\sim1.86$ higher than that of 2I/Borisov. Although the object clearly shows activity, only upper limits to the production rates of OH and CN can be estimated: $8.0\times10^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ and $4.9\times10^{23}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively. We obtained red spectral slopes consistent with those of typical D-type asteroids and outer Solar System objects.

 - **Abstract**
 The theory of galaxy formation posits a clear correlation between the spin of galaxies and the orientation of the elements of the large-scale structure of the Universe, particularly cosmic filaments. A substantial number of observational and modelling studies have been undertaken with the aim of identifying the dependence of spin orientation on the components of the large-scale structure. However, the findings of these studies remain contradictory. In this paper, we present an analysis of the orientation of the spins of 2 861 galaxies with respect to the filaments of the large-scale structure of the Universe. All galaxies in our sample have an inclination to the line of sight greater than 85 degrees, enabling an unambiguous determination of the spin axis direction in space. We investigate the alignment of galaxy spin axes relative to cosmic web filaments as a function of various properties for galaxies. Our results reveal a statistically significant tendency for the galaxy spin axes to align along the filament axes of the large-scale structure.
#### AT2019cmw: A highly luminous, cooling featureless TDE candidate from the disruption of a high mass star in an early-type galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical/UV photometric and spectroscopic observations, as well as X-ray and radio follow-up, of the extraordinary event AT2019cmw. With a peak bolometric luminosity of ~$\mathrm{10^{45.6}\,erg\,s^{-1}}$, it is one of the most luminous thermal transients ever discovered. Extensive spectroscopic follow-up post-peak showed only a featureless continuum throughout its evolution. This, combined with its nuclear location, blue colour at peak and lack of prior evidence of an AGN in its host lead us to interpret this event as a `featureless' tidal disruption event (TDE). It displays photometric evolution atypical of most TDEs, cooling from ~30 kK to ~10 kK in the first ~300 days post-peak, with potential implications for future photometric selection of candidate TDEs. No X-ray or radio emission is detected, placing constraints on the presence of on-axis jetted emission or a visible inner-accretion disk. Modelling the optical light curve with existing theoretical prescriptions, we find that AT2019cmw may be the result of the disruption of a star in the tens of solar masses by a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Combined with a lack of detectable star formation in its host galaxy, it could imply the existence of a localised region of star formation around the SMBH. This could provide a new window to probe nuclear star formation and the shape of the initial mass function (IMF) in close proximity to SMBHs out to relatively high redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 We calculate the second order perturbations driven by oscillation modes of rotating stars. Assuming that the typical amplitude $a$ of oscillation modes is small, we expand the perturbed quantities as $Q=Q^{(0)}+Q^{(1)}+Q^{(2)}+\cdots$ where $Q^{(0)}$ represents the equilibrium state and $Q^{(1)}$ and $Q^{(2)}$ are the first order and second order perturbations in $a$, respectively. We assume that the first order perturbations are given by non-axisymmetric modes and the second order perturbations are axisymmetric. For the second order perturbations, we derive a set of linear partial differential equations, which have inhomogeneous terms due to the first order perturbations. For low frequency $g$- and $r$-modes and overstable convective (OsC) modes of main sequence stars, we calculate the second order velocity field $\mathbf{v}^{(2)}$ and find that prograde $g$-modes and OsC modes tend to accelerate and retrograde $r$-modes to decelerate $v_\phi^{(2)}$ in the surface equatorial regions where $v_\phi^{(2)}$ is the $\phi$ component of $\mathbf{v}^{(2)}$. Using the angular momentum conservation equation derived for waves, we discuss that low frequency $g$- and $r$-modes transport angular momentum between the inner and outer parts of the envelope. For OsC modes in the core resonantly coupled with envelope prograde $g$-modes, we find that they can transport angular momentum from the core to the outer envelope so that they tend to brake the core rotation. We also suggest that the OsC modes provide the outer envelope of rotating stars with the torque enough to support a decretion disc.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory searches for the origins of astrophysical neutrinos using various techniques to overcome the significant backgrounds produced by cosmic-ray air showers. One such technique involves combining the neutrino data with other cosmic messengers to identify spatial and temporal correlations. IceCube contributes to multi-messenger astrophysics (MMA) by providing alerts for interesting events observed in the detector. The Gamma-ray Follow-Up (GFU) cluster alert system is one stream that identifies potential neutrino flares in realtime, producing around 20 alerts per year. GFU-cluster alerts have been privately shared with Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) through memoranda of understanding since IceCube's predecessor, AMANDA. To preserve blindness to the full behavior of our data, the current system mutes updates from sources following the initial GFU-cluster alert sent, preventing further updates until the activity drops below the alert threshold. With growing knowledge of the potential environments that produce astrophysical neutrinos and to foster open collaboration, the GFU-cluster alerts will shift to be publicly shared. Additionally, the new alert platform will provide all above-threshold information such that the source behavior after the initial alert is not obscured. The above threshold data will be distributed through an interactive website that will update the community on the status of active GFU-cluster alerts. This presentation will introduce the new GFU-cluster platform and the accompanying website, soon to be accessible to the MMA community.
#### A search for extremely-high-energy neutrinos with IceCube and implications for the ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray proton fraction

 - **Abstract**
 When ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) interact with ambient photon backgrounds, a flux of extremely-high-energy (EHE), so-called cosmogenic, neutrinos is produced. The observation of these neutrinos with IceCube can probe the nature of UHECRs. We present a search for EHE neutrinos using $12.6 \, \mathrm{years}$ of IceCube data. The non-observation of neutrinos with energies $\gtrsim 10 \, \mathrm{PeV}$ constrains the all-flavor neutrino flux at $1 \, \mathrm{EeV}$ to be below $E^2 \Phi_{\nu_e + \nu_\mu + \nu_\tau} \simeq 10^{-8} \, \mathrm{GeV} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{sr}^{-1}$, the most stringent limit to date. This constrains the proton fraction in UHECRs of energy above $30 \, \mathrm{EeV}$ to be $\lesssim 70\%$ if the evolution of the UHECR sources is similar to the star formation rate. Our analysis circumvents uncertainties associated with hadronic interaction models in studies of UHECR air showers, which also suggest a heavy composition at such energies.
#### Circular polarization of fast radio bursts by asymmetric erosion in longitudinally magnetized plasma

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetars are likely to be the origin of all fast radio bursts. The recent detection of circularly polarized bursts suggests that they might be generated deep inside magnetar magnetospheres. However, the mechanism behind the circular polarization remains uncertain. Here, we study the propagation of an intense radio pulse in a longitudinally magnetized electron-dominant plasma by particle-in-cell simulations. When the field strength of the radio pulse exceeds the background magnetic field, it can excite a nonlinear plasma wakefield and continually erodes due to energy transfer to the wake. Along the magnetic field, the plasma wakefield launched by the right-circularly polarized pulse is much stronger and more nonlinear than that by the left-circularly polarized pulse. Hence, the erosion rates of the two circularly polarized modes are significantly different. We discover that this asymmetric erosion can generate circularly polarized modes from a linearly polarized pulse at relativistic intensities, even when the cyclotron frequency is much higher than the radio frequency. Finally, we present a proof-of-principle simulation to demonstrate the generation of circularly polarization by this magneto-induced asymmetric erosion in the nonuniform environment of magnetar magnetospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding stars and their evolution is a key goal of astronomical research and has long been a focus of human interest. In recent years, theorists have paid much attention to the final interior processes within massive stars, as they can be essential for revealing neutrino-driven supernova mechanisms and other potential transients of massive star collapse. However, it is challenging to observe directly the last hours of a massive star before explosion, since it is the supernova event that triggers the start of intense observational study. Here we report evidence for a final phase of stellar activity known as a ``shell merger'', an intense shell burning in which the O-burning shell swallows its outer C-/Ne-burning shell, deep within the progenitor's interior moments before the supernova explosion. In the violent convective layer created by the shell merger, Ne, which is abundant in the stellar O-rich layer, is burned as it is pulled inward, and Si, which is synthesized inside, is transported outward. The remnant still preserves some traces of such Ne-rich downflows and Si-rich upflows in the O-rich layer, suggesting that inhomogeneous shell-merger mixing began just hours ($\lesssim 10^4$ s) before its gravitational collapse. Our results provide the first observational evidence that the final stellar burning process rapidly alters the internal structure, leaving a pre-supernova asymmetry. This breaking of spherical symmetry facilitates the explosion of massive stars and influences various supernova and remnant characteristics, including explosion asymmetries and the neutron star's kick and spin.
#### The Impact of Natal Kicks on Black Hole Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 In massive binary-star systems, supernova explosions can significantly alter the orbit during the formation of compact objects. Some compact objects are predicted to form via direct collapse, a scenario with negligible mass loss and no baryonic ejecta emitted. In this scenario, most of the energy is released via neutrinos, and any resulting natal kick arises from asymmetries in their emission. Here I investigate stellar collapse leading to binary black hole (BH) formation, with a focus on how the natal kick influences the gravitational-wave-driven merger time. Broadly, I find three regimes. For low natal kicks, the effect on the time-to-coalescence is negligible. For moderate natal kicks, if the binary remains bound, up to 50% of binary BHs experience a decrease in their time-to-coalescence by more than an order of magnitude. For large natal kicks, although most binaries become unbound, those that remain bound may acquire retrograde orbits and/or lead to shorter time-to-coalescence. For binary BH mergers, large natal kicks ($\gtrsim100$ km/s) are hard to reconcile with both neutrino natal kicks and the complete collapse scenario. This suggests that retrograde orbits and shortened merger times could only arise in volatile BH formation scenarios or if spin-axis tossing is at work. Consequently, electromagnetic observations of BHs in massive star binaries within the Local Group offer a more effective means to probe the physics behind complete collapse. Another promising population for deciphering the complete collapse scenario is that of massive, wide binaries. Although Gaia may help shed light on these systems, longer observational baselines will likely be needed to fully understand the roles of neutrino natal kicks and stellar collapse in BH formation.
#### Why Jet Power and Star Formation Are Uncorrelated in Active Galaxies

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07865

 - **Abstract**
 Jet luminosity from active galaxies and the rate of star formation have recently been found to be uncorrelated observationally. We show how to understand this in the context of a model in which powerful AGN jets enhance star formation for up to hundreds of millions of years while jet power decreases in time, followed by a longer phase in which star formation is suppressed but coupled to jet power increasing with time. We also highlight characteristic differences depending on environment richness in a way that is also compatible with the observed SEDs of high redshift radio galaxies. While the absence of a direct correlation between jet power and star formation rate emerges naturally, our framework allows us to also predict the environment richness, range of excitation and redshift values of radio AGN in the jet power-star formation rate plane.
