 - **Abstract**
 When low-mass ($\lesssim 2$ $M_{\odot}$) red giants lose their envelopes to a companion just before the helium flash, the resulting mass transfer can produce binaries hosting hot subdwarfs, horizontal branch stars, and undermassive red clump stars. Recent work predicts a continuum of such products, from fully stripped hot subdwarfs to partially stripped horizontal branch and red clump stars, and suggests that young, metal-rich RR Lyrae can form when partial stripping leaves a helium-burning star in the instability strip. To enable direct comparison with observations, we model these binaries in a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy with a realistic metallicity-dependent star formation history and 3D dust map, generate epoch astrometry using Gaia's scanning law, and fit it with the cascade of astrometric models applied in Gaia DR3. We compare the simulated population to DR3 observations of hot subdwarfs, RR Lyrae, and red giants with high astrometric mass functions. The model significantly overpredicts the number of hot subdwarfs with astrometric binary solutions, partly because the predicted flux ratios are more unequal than observed. It also predicts $\gtrsim 100$ RR Lyrae with DR3 astrometric orbital solutions, while none are observed. We conclude that RR Lyrae in au-scale binaries may be substantially rarer than predicted. In contrast, the model plausibly explains the population of red clump stars with high astrometric mass functions, which we interpret as potential black hole impostors. We predict that $\sim 10 \times$ more stripped-star binaries will be detectable in DR4, whose sensitivity to longer periods will more strongly test wide-orbit systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation in galaxies is governed by internal and environmental processes, yet their relative roles are not well understood. In particular, uncertainties in measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies, combined with modeling limitations, obfuscate the impact of supermassive black hole feedback across environments and over time. Here we address this with a comprehensive analysis of ~60,000 nearby AGNs (z < 0.15 and new environment and halo-mass measurements for ~500,000 AGN and non-AGN host galaxies. This benchmark enables unified comparisons with three prominent cosmological simulations--SIMBA, TNG, and EAGLE--and reveals major, contrasting shortcomings. Simulations fail to reproduce observed trends linking star formation, quiescence, AGN luminosity, stellar mass, and halo mass. While simulations qualitatively capture that AGNs are more common in low-mass halos than in rich groups or clusters, detailed host demographics diverge strongly from observations. Partial agreement exists in the stellar mass distribution within large-scale structures, yet all simulations overproduce quenched low-mass satellites in massive halos, while misrepresenting quenched fractions of massive central galaxies and those in low-density environments, which are sensitive to feedback implementation. Improved AGN physics and modeling of multi-phase gas cooling and flows are required to capture the observed interplay between black holes, galaxies, and halos.
#### FRESCO: Constraining Dust Attenuation and Star-Formation Rates of $z\sim 2$ Star-Forming Galaxies with JWST Paschen and Ground-Based Balmer Emission Line Observations

 - **Abstract**
 We present new constraints on dust attenuation and star-formation rates (SFRs) for 77 galaxies at redshifts $z=1.43-2.65$, using Paschen emission line detections from the JWST FRESCO survey and ground-based Balmer line measurements from the MOSDEF survey. Using nebular and continuum emission maps, we find that Paschen emission covers a smaller area than continuum emission observed in the F210M (2.1 $\mu$m; rest-frame optical) and F444W (4.4 $\mu$m; rest-frame near-IR) bands, and is preferentially located toward galaxy outskirts. These results suggest that current star formation is concentrated in regions farther from galaxy centers than older stellar populations traced by the continuum, indicative of inside-out star formation. With a careful accounting of slit-loss corrections for ground-based measurements, we calculate nebular reddening and dust-corrected SFRs using the Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta$) and Paschen-to-Balmer line ratios (Pa$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$/H$\alpha$), assuming the Milky Way extinction curve. On average, Paschen-derived reddening and SFRs agree with Balmer-derived values; however, two galaxies exhibit significantly higher Paschen reddening and four show significantly higher Paschen SFRs. We find that non-unity dust covering fractions bias the Balmer decrement toward less reddened OB associations, while decrements involving the Paschen lines are less affected by this bias. These results highlight the enhanced sensitivity of the Paschen lines to the most heavily obscured OB associations in $z\sim2$ galaxies, particularly in galaxies with patchy dust geometries. Future studies using Paschen lines exclusively to measure nebular reddening will yield more robust constraints on the dustiest star-forming regions.
#### Probing the magnetic fields and dust properties in the young embedded star-forming region AFGL 6366S using Near Infrared and Optical linear polarimetry

 - **Abstract**
 We present Near-Infrared (NIR) and Optical linear polarimetry towards the partially embedded cluster AFGL 6366S. The polarization ranges from 0.44-10.3 per cent in NIR and 0.16-11.22 per cent in Optical bands. The position angle spans $1^\circ - 179^\circ$ in both NIR and Optical bands. About 22 stars exhibit intrinsic polarization signatures. A polarization hole is evident towards the densest ($\sim 3.4 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) and warmest ($\sim 28.8 \mathrm{K}$) central cluster region. It is attributable to depolarization induced by Radiative Torque Disruption (RAT-D) of large grains and a modest contribution from magnetic-field tangling. The local magnetic field towards the cluster's central region is significantly misaligned with both the large-scale Galactic field and the long axis of the filament present in the region. The field morphology wraps around two dense molecular clumps of radii 0.34 pc and 0.22 pc and $\mathrm N(\mathrm H_2)$ = $(7.9 \pm 1.1) \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $(4.3 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. The clumps are embedded in the filamentary structure and represent locally accelerated stages of mass accumulation. Gravitationally driven mass flows, largely perpendicular to the local magnetic field, produce a U-shaped field curvature across the filament axis. The plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths towards the two clumps are $ 447.91 \pm 83.81 \mu\mathrm{G}$ and $396.66 \pm 73.64 \mu\mathrm{G}$. The corresponding mass-to-flux ratios ($\lambda \sim 1.34$ and $0.82$) indicate that one clump is magnetically supercritical and the other is subcritical. The Alfven Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}_A$) $\sim$ 0.395 and 0.393 indicate that both the clumps are in sub-Alfvénic state.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a radio-continuum survey of the LMC using the MeerKAT telescope, describe the full-Stokes products included in the first data release, and highlight some initial results. The observations are centred at 1.3 GHz with a bandwidth of 0.8 GHz. The imaging products comprise six fields of view, each encompassing $\sim$5$^\circ$ $\times$ 5$^\circ$ with the resulting images achieving a resolution of 8". The median broad-band Stokes~I image root-mean-square noise value is $\sim$11 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. The survey enables a variety of astrophysical studies, which we showcase with the presentation of a few findings. Within the LMC we identify a new supernova remnant candidate; present planetary nebulae and Wolf-Rayet stars without previous radio detections; and show the MeerKAT view of the well-known star-forming region 30 Doradus. We also present some examples of interesting foreground and background sources in the field, including the AB~Dor multiple-star system, a radio ring galaxy, a possible Odd Radio Circle, and a remarkable bent-tail radio galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present spatially resolved measurements of turbulence driving modes across entire extragalactic discs of NGC7793 and NGC1313, using Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) CO(J=2-1) observations at 13pc resolution. By applying a kernel-based analysis of density and velocity fluctuations, we map the turbulence driving parameter, b, which characterises the balance between solenoidal ($b\sim0.3$) and compressive ($b\sim1$) turbulent driving regimes. b is quantified as the ratio of the turbulent density fluctuations relative to the turbulent sonic Mach number, M. Both galaxies show predominantly solenoidal driving on average for the regions where we find valid results ($b\geq 0.33(\pm 0.05)^{+0.14}_{-0.10}$ in NGC7793; $b\geq 0.24(\pm 0.03)^{+0.10}_{-0.07}$ in NGC1313), noting that this is without including the influences of magnetic fields, making these measurements lower limits. We find substantial spatial variation of b, including localised regions of strongly compressive driving. NGC1313 exhibits higher turbulent Mach numbers and density dispersions than NGC7793, consistent with the disturbed morphology and recent satellite interaction in NGC1313. The turbulence in both NGC7793 and NGC1313 is supersonic ($3\lesssim M\lesssim 20$), and NGC1313 shows a radially decreasing trend of M with galactocentric radius. Radial trends indicate more solenoidal driving in the galaxy centres, potentially reflecting enhanced shear, and increasingly compressive modes in the outskirts. These results demonstrate that turbulence driving varies systematically with galactic environment and cannot be assumed uniform across discs. Our study applies a previously established method to larger scales and new data, linking local turbulence physics to global star formation regulation in galaxies, providing a new avenue for testing theoretical models with future integral field units and ALMA surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the extensively debated star-forming main sequence (SFMS)-a tight correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass in both kiloparsec-resolved and integrated galaxies. We statistically explore the fundamental drivers of star formation at global scales, using a large volume-limited sample of 24,954 local star-forming galaxies to overcome the limitations of previous works. Based on the mid-infrared 12 micron luminosity, stellar mass, and g-r color, we estimate the molecular gas mass for the considered sample. At galaxy-wide scales, we establish global relations between the surface densities of the star formation rate, stellar mass, and molecular gas mass . These global density relations are connected with and follow similar trends as the resolved SFMS, the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, and the molecular gas main sequence (MGMS). Taking advantage of this large catalog, we show that the scatters in the global KS and MGMS relations are smaller than that of the global relation between the star formation rate surface density and stellar mass surface density, and their Pearson correlation coefficients are higher. More importantly, multivariate regression and partial correlation analyses demonstrate that the apparent correlation between the star formation rate surface density and stellar mass surface density is entirely mediated by the molecular gas surface density, with its best-fit parameters directly derivable from those of the KS and MGMS relations. Overall, our findings suggest that the correlation between stellar mass and molecular gas, as well as that between molecular gas and star formation, are more direct and fundamental. The star-forming main sequence thus appears to be a natural by-product of these two tighter relations.

 - **Abstract**
 GRB 250221A is a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) at redshift $z=0.768$, with a duration of 1.8 s and no extended emission in either Swift/BAT or Konus-Wind bands. A remarkable re-brightening feature in both optical and X-ray bands was observed at $\sim 0.6$ days after the burst trigger, but no supernova or kilonova signature was detected. The burst properties and empirical correlations or distributions (e.g., duration, spectral hardness, location in the Amati correlation, $\varepsilon-$value, $f_{\rm eff}$ parameter, and physical offset) favor a compact binary merger origin. However, a dense circumburst medium with $n\sim 80\rm~cm^{-3}$, obtained by adopting the energy injection into a jet to interpret the late-time re-brightening is inconsistent with the compact binary merger origin. In this paper, we propose a two-component jet model to explain the multiwavelength afterglow observations of GRB 250221A, in which the relativistic narrow jet ($\rm \theta_{c} \sim 3.8^\circ$) produces the prompt and the early decay afterglow emission, while the mildly relativistic wide jet ($\rm \theta_{w} \sim 4.4^\circ$) dominates at later times, resulting in the observed re-brightening feature. If this is the case, one can obtain a lower medium density with $n\sim 0.72\rm~cm^{-3}$ which is a little bit higher than that of short GRBs in merger environments, but falls into the reasonable and acceptable range. Finally, a possible kilonova emission is also discussed within the scenario of compact star merger origin of GRB 250221A.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution tri-axial simulations are indispensable for realistically co-modeling the dynamical signatures and the radiative fingerprints of astrophysical jets, which are becoming increasingly important in modern computational studies of jet physics. However, such simulations impose extreme computational requirements that often exceed the capabilities of conventional CPU-based codes. GPU-accelerated simulations offer a transformative solution to mitigate these limitations. In this work, we present a detailed performance benchmarking of the recently developed GPU-enabled PLUTO code (gPLUTO), demonstrating runtime speed-ups ranging from an order of magnitude to (approximately) over 30 relative to CPU-only configurations. A direct comparison between computations of extragalactic jet propagation performed at different grid resolutions confirm the physical fidelity and production readiness of the gPLUTO code, while underscoring the importance of resolving the jet radius adequately to capture the jet dynamics accurately. Leveraging GPU-PLUTO's capabilities, we finally present an application by performing high-resolution simulations of giant radio galaxy jets (GRGs $\gtrsim 1$ Mpc), representing the first such well-resolved 3D study to our knowledge (resolving scales down to 500 pc). These simulations probe a range of environmental effects on GRG jets, clarifying their formation from central galaxies within host cosmic structures, rapid peripheral expansion, and the development of asymmetric cocoon morphologies.
#### AVID: A Near-Major Post-Merger of Late-Type Dwarfs beneath a Regularly Rotating HI Disk (VCC 693)

 - **Abstract**
 On the periphery of galaxy clusters, moderately high galaxy densities and velocity dispersions favour interactions and mergers that influence galaxy evolution prior to cluster infall. Observational studies of this phase in dwarfs remain rare. We present a high-resolution study of the merger remnant VCC 693 in the outskirts of Virgo cluster, using observations from the Atomic gas in Virgo Interacting Dwarf galaxies (AVID) project. We explore the origin of VCC 693 and the consequences of the merger on its star formation and structure through a joint analysis of VLA and FAST HI emission line observations, together with complementary optical imaging and spectroscopy. We employ hydrodynamical simulations to help interpret the observations. Our analysis favours a near-major merger between two dwarfs with a stellar mass ratio of 3:1-4:1, with one likely gas-poor progenitor (i.e., a damp merger). The optical appearance of VCC 693 is dominated by complex tidal structures throughout the system, whereas the HI gas has settled to a regular rotating disk. Compared with similar-mass dwarfs, the central star formation and gas-phase metallicity are moderately enhanced. The global star formation rate, HI gas content, and HI-to-optical size ratio of VCC 693 are broadly consistent with those of typical dwarfs of similar mass, albeit somewhat lower. Decomposition of the HI rotation curve into baryonic and dark matter indicates a high halo concentration, suggesting post-merger relaxation into a more centrally peaked configuration. Together with two recent studies of AVID post-merger systems, these results support the view that even major dwarf mergers can produce remnants with overall stellar structures indistinguishable from ordinary dwarfs, and that the environmental effects in cluster outskirts can promote damp or mixed mergers, constituting an integral part of galactic pre-processing.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) actively contribute to the thermodynamics, chemistry, and radiative state of the interstellar medium (ISM), yet most ISM models and galaxy simulations either exclude them altogether or adopt simplified treatments. We present CALIMA, a new module for dust and PAH formation and evolution in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations for RAMSES, designed to self-consistently couple dust physics to radiative transfer and non-equilibrium thermochemistry in a multiphase ISM. The model employs a two-size, two-composition dust framework with log-normal grain populations, explicitly evolving stellar dust injection, turbulence-informed gas-phase accretion, shattering, coagulation, thermal and non-thermal sputtering, and shock destruction, while PAHs are separate components with their own evolution. The evolving dust populations and radiation field determine local, wavelength-dependent opacities, photoelectric heating efficiencies, grain-assisted recombination, dust-gas collisional heating/cooling, and H$_2$ formation on both grains and PAHs. Updated treatments of thermal sputtering and collisional cooling that include finite grain sizes and modern ion-solid physics reduce sputtering rates at high temperatures and extend the regime where dust significantly cools hot gas. One-zone ISM tests show that dust and PAH evolution modifies classical thermal phase diagrams and C-bearing chemistry, while isolated disc galaxy simulations reveal environment-dependent variations in dust-to-metal ratio, small-to-large grain ratio, PAH fraction, and interstellar radiation field intensity that drive non-trivial structure in infrared emission, UV transparency, and H$_2$ formation. CALIMA provides a physically motivated framework to interpret dust- and PAH-based observables and to assess dust-mediated feedback in galaxy formation across cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 All gas-rich galaxies in cluster environments are expected to experience ram-pressure stripping from the intra-cluster medium. However, only a fraction of these develop ongoing star-formation in their stripped tail, becoming the so-called ``jellyfish'' galaxies. In this work we provide observational evidence that magnetic fields can signal differences in the extraplanar star formation and explore what are the physical conditions that lead to the formation of a jellyfish galaxy. We first focus on JO147, a jellyfish galaxy that features weak star formation activity in its tail. Using MeerKAT radio continuum observations, we discover polarized emission only in a small fraction of its tail, with an average fraction of $~10\%$, and a low Mach number $\mathcal{M}=1.3-1.6$, which suggests a possible association between magnetic field draping, shock-compression of the gas, and extraplanar star formation activity. Then, we test this scenario in a sample of 17 jellyfish galaxies from the GASP project. We combine dynamical models for their orbits within the host clusters with realistic cluster temperature profiles to infer their Mach number, and we find a positive correlation between it and the star formation activity in their tail. We conclude that supersonic motion is a necessary condition for triggering star formation in the stripped tails of jellyfish galaxies. Our findings provide empirical evidence that the critical factor preventing the stripped gas evaporation is the shock compression induced by the supersonic motion through the cluster. This process likely enhances the magnetic field surrounding the galaxy and the properties of the stripped material.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been 10 years since the initial discovery of Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) in the Coma cluster and the revelation that large, low surface brightness galaxies may constitute a greater fraction of galaxies than first thought. This left an open question: Are UDGs something special, or just an extension of the previously known dwarf galaxy population? Seeking to answer this question, in the decade following, dedicated simulations have studied and proposed a myriad of formation pathways to create UDGs. Observations have then pushed the limits of world-class observatories to perform detailed studies of these galaxies in large numbers across the full range of environments in the local Universe. These observations stress test simulations and challenge previous galaxy formation wisdom, with UDGs posing many open puzzles beyond just their unknown formation mechanism. To provide a few pertinent examples: there is observational evidence that not all UDGs follow the standard stellar mass -- halo mass relationship; there is evidence for UDGs with extraordinarily high levels of alpha enhancement; and there is evidence that some UDGs are much more globular cluster rich than other dwarfs of similar stellar mass. In this Dawes review, we undertake the task of summarising the decade of science since the discovery of UDGs. We focus on the quiescent population of UDGs and review their general properties, their proposed formation scenarios, their internal properties and their globular cluster systems. We also provide a brief conjecture on some future directions for the next decade of UDG research.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological simulations suggest that various galaxy properties depend on their location within the cosmic web. Yet direct observational evidence of the dependence of star formation activity on distance to filaments remains scarce and is missing at z>1. We investigate how starburst, main-sequence (MS), and quenched galaxies are distributed with respect to cosmic web filaments, and how this distribution evolves with redshift. We first use the SIMBA cosmological simulation to predict the redshift evolution of the mean distance to the closest filament from z=3 to z=0 for different galaxy populations after removing stellar-mass dependencies. We then measure the corresponding signal in the COSMOS field, using COSMOS2020 and COSMOS-Web data, where accurate photometric redshifts enable reconstruction of the projected cosmic web from z=2 to z=0.5, and starbursts are identified through far-infrared spectral energy distribution fitting. In agreement with the results from SIMBA, starburst galaxies are found closer to filaments at z>1 and at larger distances at z<1, MS galaxies occupy intermediate environments with little evolution, and quenched galaxies show progressively shorter distances to filaments toward low redshift, with a crossing between starburst and MS populations around z~1. In COSMOS-Web, the relative evolution in the average distance to filaments between starburst and MS galaxies is detected at a significance level of at least 5{\sigma}. We show that a minimal toy model in which the only environmental ingredient is the sSFR-filament distance modulation measured in simulations is sufficient to reproduce the observed differential evolution of the average filament distance between starburst and MS galaxies. These results show that the imprint of large-scale environmental effects on the star formation activity of galaxies, predicted by simulations, is detectable from z=2 down to z=0.5.
#### Probing Large-scale Structure and the Multi-Phase IGM at the Cosmic Noon -- Insights from a Joint Survey with Euclid, CSST, JPCam, and JUST

 - **Abstract**
 We present scientific and technical justifications of a potential coordinated Euclid/CSST/JPCam/JUST survey of the Euclid Deep Field North (EDF-N), aimed at probing the multi-phase circumgalactic and intergalactic medium (CGM/IGM) at the cosmic noon over ~20 deg$^2$. The survey is structured around three connected goals: (1) improving photometric redshift (photo-z) accuracy through the combination of broad- and narrow-band photometry, enabling reliable identification of large-scale structures; (2) probing extended CGM emission with dedicated narrow-band imaging; and (3) mapping foreground IGM via absorption-line spectroscopy of background galaxies. Together, these components establish an integrated observational framework to investigate galactic ecosystems -- linking galaxies to their circumgalactic and intergalactic environments -- at cosmic noon. We show that the J-PAS-like narrow-band system used in JPCam substantially improves photo-z accuracies from only the Euclid/CSST broad-band data, especially for star-forming galaxies at z~1.0-1.4. This enables the identification of galaxy groups and (proto-)clusters directly from photo-z measurements. Stacked JPCam narrow-band imaging should also detect extended [O II]-emitting CGM halos. We then construct mock 3D gas distribution model and realistic galaxy catalog, and further construct mock CSST and JUST background galaxy spectra adding Lyalpha and Mg II absorptions. The reconstructed 3D H I field from CSST Lyalpha forest reliably recovers large-scale structures; however, our simulations indicate that detecting diffuse IGM Mg II absorption with JUST is infeasible, either through spectral stacking or via the two-point correlation function method. We conclude that constraining the metallicity of the diffuse IGM will require significantly deeper and higher-resolution spectroscopy expected from future facilities such as the 39 m E-ELT.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectroscopic study of low-mass galaxies (LMGs;$10^8\leq\rm M_*/M_\odot\leq10^9$) at $z\sim0.15$ in COSMOS field, and compare it to a control sample of intermediate-mass galaxies (IMGs;$10^9\leq\rm M_*/M_\odot\leq10^{10}$) at $z\sim0.35$. We examine their star formation rates (SFRs), dust attenuation properties, and the relationship between nebular and stellar reddening. For both samples, SFRs derived from H$\alpha$ are strongly correlated with SFRs from fitting simple star formation histories (SFHs) to the galaxies' spectral energy distributions. In fitting a joint SFR-$\rm M_*$ relation, we obtain a slope of $\rm {\Delta log(SFR_{H\alpha})}/{\Delta log(M_*/M_\odot)}=1.01\pm0.03$, indicating that fair ensembles of SFHs for galaxies at these stellar masses are well-described by scale-free, self-similar forms. We also examine their dust attenuation properties and the relationship between nebular and stellar reddening, exploring how these quantities vary with stellar mass and specific SFR (sSFR). Nebular attenuation increases with stellar mass for IMGs but is lower and less mass-dependent in LMGs, consistent with their reduced dust content. In all cases, stellar continuum attenuation is lower than nebular attenuation, as expected from the two-component dust model. The nebular-to-stellar color excess ratio in both samples is consistent with the canonical factor of 2.27. The ratio is mass-independent, but rises with sSFR in IMGs and remains constant in LMGs. These results suggest that in LMGs, efficient dispersal of birth clouds keeps the differential attenuation approximately constant across sSFR. Thus, although LMGs follow the same global SFR-$\rm M_*$ scaling as massive galaxies, their lower dust content and feedback-maintained ISM produce distinct attenuation behavior relative to IMGs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) survey of compact radio sources in the Orion complex, conducted within both the DYNAMO-VLBA and the GOBELINS projects. Our observations detected 216 compact radio sources, of which 58 yielded reliable multi-epoch astrometric solutions. For these sources, we derived trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions with typical precisions of about 0.05 mas and 0.10 mas yr$^{-1}$, respectively. The measured parallaxes range between 2.26 and 2.65 mas, corresponding to distances of 380 - 440 pc, and delineate the depth of the Orion star-forming complex. We determine mean distances of $405\pm16$ pc for NGC 2068, $403\pm5$ pc for NGC 2024, $407\pm12$ pc for the $\sigma$ Orionis region, $388.5\pm1.7$ pc for the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), and $438\pm12$ pc for L1641. A comparison with Gaia DR3 astrometry for 28 common sources reveals negligible mean parallax offsets ($\Delta\varpi=-0.02\pm0.01$ mas) and small systematic differences in proper motions ($\sim$0.07 mas yr$^{-1}$), likely due to residual rotation of the Gaia reference frame. Our results demonstrate the capability of high-precision radio astrometry to map embedded stellar populations and to provide an independent calibration of the Gaia reference system in obscured regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Newly formed stars have a profound impact on their environment by depositing energy and momentum into the surrounding gas. However, only a fraction of the stellar feedback is retained in the cloud and observational constraints are needed to further our understanding of this process. In a sample of 19 nearby galaxies, we match HII regions from PHANGS$\unicode{x2013}$MUSE to their ionizing stellar source from PHANGS$\unicode{x2013}$HST and measure the percentage of ionizing radiation that is leaking into the surrounding diffuse ionized gas (DIG). Based on a catalogue, where each HII region is powered by a single young and massive stellar association, we measure a photon escape fraction of $f_\mathrm{esc}=82^{+12}_{-24}$ per cent. Comparable results are obtained when different procedures are used to match the ionized gas to its source. All samples we study contain a substantial fraction of objects (up to 20 per cent), where the stellar source is not sufficient to produce the H$\alpha$ flux observed from the nebula. Many of them are probably related to uncertain age estimates, but we also find numerous regions, where a significant fraction of the ionizing photon budget is contributed by stars that reside outside the boundaries of the HII region. This motivates the use of an alternative galaxy-wide approach, in which we include all HII regions and stellar sources, not just the ones that show a clear overlap. When summing up the ionization budget over entire galaxies, we measure slightly lower, but consistent values.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of strongly absorbed [OI]63um in a sample of 12 DSFGs at 4.2<z<5.8 selected from the SPT survey. This is the first systematic survey of the [OI]63um fine-structure line at z>4. Using ALMA Bands 9 and 10, we obtain spatially and spectrally resolved observations that probe the interstellar medium on sub-kpc scales. Despite reaching sensitivities 10-100x deeper than most previous studies, we detect [OI]63um in emission in only 2 sources at low significance, with the remaining galaxies yielding stringent non-detections over the full velocity range covered by robust detections of other far-infrared lines, including [CII] and [NII]205um. We identify several compact (0.05-0.2") regions having [OI]63um absorption against the far-infrared dust continuum, some of which are possibly reaching below rest-frame CMB radiation level. We also detect narrow, spatially localised [OI]63um emission "escape channels" preferentially detected in regions with weak or absent dust continuum emission. We predict that similar absorption effects may appear in the [CII] line, particularly when concentrating on the regions with the densest foreground material along the line of sight. The [OI]63um line appears to be originate from a mix of compact, high optical depth [OI]63um emitting regions and sub-thermally excited, oxygen-rich molecular clouds dispersed throughout high-redshift starbursts that are capable of absorbing the ground-state line emission. Combined with a comparison to cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulations, this supports the interpretation that regions with higher gas and dust column densities may lead to weakening an intrinsically strong [OI]63um line emission. We argue that the high [OI]63um optical depth is the dominant effect causing the strong absorption, limiting the diagnostic power of this line to trace regions of massive star formation in high-redshift DSFGs.

 - **Abstract**
 In low-luminosity active galactic nuclei like M87* and Sgr A*, the accretion disk around the central supermassive black hole is tenuous and collisionless. As a result, the usual ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) approximation may not be applicable. In this Letter, we report on the first fully kinetic simulations of the accretion process where the plasma initially has finite angular momentum. The simulated accretion flow behaves remarkably similarly to the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) regime of ideal MHD, reproducing episodes of magnetic flux saturation and eruption typical of MADs. The resemblance to fluid models owes largely to kinetic instabilities, which regulate pressure anisotropy in the disk, allowing fluid terms to dominate the angular momentum transfer. In addition, by handling vacuum regions effectively, our kinetic approach probes the matter supply to the jet funnel. We observe no efficient penetration of the accreting material into this region, which suggests that a pair discharge may be required to sustain the Blandford-Znajek process.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite decades of observations, the physical processes governing mass loss from small bodies beyond our Solar System remain poorly constrained. These exocomets are often treated as analogs of Solar System comet, yet the stellar environments they inhabit spans a wide range in terms of luminosity, stellar winds, and evolutionary stage, leading to potentially very diverse physical behaviors. Within our Solar System, small bodies lose material through a range of mechanisms, including sublimation, desorption, impacts, and/or sputtering. Once released, the composition and dynamics of the ejecta are then altered by additional processes, such as dust sublimation, ionization, and radiation pressure. In extrasolar systems, these mechanisms unfold under vastly different radiative and plasma conditions, leading to a rich diversity of mass-loss pathways and observable signatures. This work reviews our understanding of the mechanisms driving mass loss from small bodies and the subsequent evolution of ejecta in diverse stellar environments. We compare the physical and chemical mechanisms that drive gas and dust production, and investigate how they scale with stellar luminosity, temperature, and activity. We then examine the processes that modify the composition of the ejecta (e.g., dust sublimation, dissociation, or ionisation) and its dynamics (e.g., radiation pressure or stellar winds). To illustrate how these processes vary across different stellar environments, we use four well-studied planetary systems as case studies: the Sun, $\beta$ Pictoris, AU Microscopii, and WD 1145+017. By exploring how cometary tails behave under such diverse conditions, this work provides a physical framework for interpreting exocometary activity and sheds light on why A-type stars, such as the famous $\beta$ Pictoris, are over-represented in the population of exocomet-hosting stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The far side of the Moon, shielded from terrestrial radio frequency interference and beyond the influence of Earth's ionosphere, should offer a uniquely quiet environment for radio astronomy and cosmological experiments. The radio sky below 30 MHz is largely unexplored and is thought to contain spectral signatures of new physics in the early, high-redshift Universe. Achieving precision measurements in this band requires accurate understanding of antenna performance and systematics. For upcoming lunar surface radio astronomy missions, this modeling will be challenging because antennas will deploy at heights that are only a small fraction of a wavelength above the lunar regolith, where strong coupling between the antenna and the surface can significantly alter impedance, radiation patterns, and efficiency. The challenge is compounded by the layered dielectric structure of the regolith and the tendency for permittivity to increase with depth, both of which are difficult to represent faithfully in numerical simulations. In this work, we review theoretical predictions for the behavior of a simple horizontal dipole above a dielectric half-space, representing the lunar regolith, and compare them with simulation results obtained using the Ansys HFSS integral equation solver. We quantify how the antenna impedance and beam pattern couple to the sky for a representative lunar surface radio astronomy experiment. The results show that surface induced effects decrease rapidly, even for modest increases in antenna height above the regolith. Conversely, a dipole antenna placed on or very near the lunar surface will exhibit complex spectral response that renders systematics control very difficult without detailed information on regolith properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-mass dwarf galaxies ($M_{\rm vir} \lesssim 10^9\rm\ M_\odot$) are fundamental cosmological building blocks, yet the physical processes driving their structural diversity remain poorly understood. Recent numerical simulations have suggested a diversity in the stellar-to-halo mass ratio in this halo mass range, but either the number of samples obtained from the same simulation setup or the numerical resolution was limited. We performed high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations for eight galaxies with a dark matter halo mass of $\sim 10^9\rm\ M_{\odot}$ up to $t=1.2$ Gyr at which most gas in the galaxies has been expelled. Our samples have a scatter of an order of magnitude in the halo mass at the reionization epoch. The stellar-to-halo mass ratio expected at $z=0$ scatters nearly two orders of magnitude with $5\times10^{-5}$ to $2\times10^{-3}$. We also observed variation in the compactness of their stellar distributions. Some of our simulated galaxies exhibit a stellar half-mass radius of $\sim30$ pc, which is as small as that of ultra-compact dwarfs. The formation condition for such a compact stellar distribution is understood as an analog of the condition for the formation of dense, massive star clusters. We found that when the central gas surface density exceeds a critical threshold ($\Sigma_{\rm gas} \gtrsim 30\rm\ M_\odot \rm\ {pc}^{-2}$), the star formation becomes highly efficient and results in dense stellar systems. These results suggest that UCDs can form in situ even in isolated dark matter halos.
