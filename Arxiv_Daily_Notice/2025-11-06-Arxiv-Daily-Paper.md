 - **Abstract**
 Space weather is among the most powerful and least understood forces shaping planetary atmospheres. In our Solar System, we observe its effects directly: atmospheric escape, chemical disruption, and spectacular auroral displays. Yet for exoplanets, we lack the tools and data to comprehensively assess the impacts of space weather, especially invisible elements like stellar winds, coronal mass ejections, energetic particles, and variable interplanetary magnetic fields. This problem lies at the intersection of four key fields: heliophysics, planetary science, astrobiology, and astrophysics. In 2023--2025, experts from these four fields convened at the W. M. Keck Institute for Space Studies to explore pathways for advancing the study of exospace weather. Organizing the subject into five core themes -- planets and their stellar particle environments, stellar magnetism and space weather modeling, quasi-steady stellar winds, transient events, and programmatic pathways -- our team synthesized concepts from across relevant fields and identified a wide array of opportunities for progress. This report is the product of that effort. It assembles cross-disciplinary knowledge; highlights outstanding theoretical challenges; explores promising innovations in observation, modeling, methodology, and instrumentation; and makes recommendations for accelerating community-wide progress. Together, these lay out a path to transforming the challenging, yet tractable problem of exospace weather into a foundational element of our understanding exoplanetary systems, and our own Solar System, in their entirety.

 - **Abstract**
 Studies of the rotational velocities of intermediate-mass main-sequence stars are crucial for testing stellar evolution theory. They often rely on spectroscopic measurements of the projected rotation velocities. These not only suffer from the unknown projection factor but tend to ignore additional line-profile broadening mechanisms aside from rotation, such as pulsations and turbulent motions near the stellar surface. This limits the accuracy of Veq distributions. We use asteroseismic measurements to investigate the distribution of the equatorial rotation velocity, its ratio with respect to the critical rotation velocity, and the specific angular momentum for several thousands of BAF-type stars, covering a mass range from 1.3M$_\odot$ to 8.8M$_\odot$ and almost the entire core-hydrogen burning phase. We rely on high-precision model-independent internal rotation frequencies, as well as on masses and radii from asteroseismology to deduce Veq, Veq/Vcrit, and J/M for 2937 gravity-mode pulsators in the Milky Way. The sample stars have rotation frequencies between almost zero and 33$\mu$Hz, corresponding to rotation periods above 0.35d. We find that intermediate-mass stars experience a break in their J/M occurring in the mass interval $[2.3,2.7]\,$M$_\odot$. We establish unimodal Veq and Veq/Vcrit distributions for the mass range $[1.3,2.5[$M$_\odot$, while stars with $M\in[2.5,8.8]$M$_\odot$ reveal some structure in their distributions. We find that the near-core rotation slows down as stars evolve, pointing to very efficient angular momentum transport. The kernel density estimators of the asteroseismic internal rotation frequency, equatorial rotation velocity, and specific angular momentum of this large sample of intermediate-mass field stars can conveniently be used for population synthesis studies and to fine-tune the theory of stellar rotation across the main sequence evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) is a powerful probe of early star formation and stellar mass build-up. At z > 6, its bright end (MUV < -21) remains poorly constrained due to the small volumes of existing near-infrared (NIR) space-based surveys. The Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs) will cover 53 deg^2 with NIR imaging down to 26.5 AB, increasing area by a factor of 100 over previous space-based surveys. They thus offer an unprecedented opportunity to select bright z > 6 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and constrain the UV LF's bright end. With NIR coverage extending to 2um, Euclid can detect galaxies out to z = 13. We present forecasts for the number densities of z > 6 galaxies expected in the final EDF dataset. Using synthetic photometry from spectral energy distribution (SED) templates of z = 5--15 galaxies, z = 1--4 interlopers, and Milky Way MLT dwarfs, we explore optimal selection methods for high-z LBGs. A combination of S/N cuts with SED fitting (from optical to MIR) yields the highest-fidelity sample, recovering >76% of input z > 6 LBGs while keeping low-z contamination <10%. This excludes instrumental artefacts, which will affect early Euclid releases. Auxiliary data are critical: optical imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam and Vera C. Rubin Observatory distinguishes genuine Lyman breaks, while Spitzer/IRAC data help recover z > 10 sources. Based on empirical double power-law LF models, we expect >100,000 LBGs at z = 6-12 and >100 at z > 12 in the final Euclid release. In contrast, steeper Schechter models predict no z > 12 detections. We also present two ultra-luminous (MUV < -23.5) candidates from the EDF-N Q1 dataset. If their redshifts are confirmed, their magnitudes support a DPL LF model at z > 9, highlighting Euclid's power to constrain the UV LF's bright end and identify the most luminous early galaxies for follow-up.

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the star formation histories (SFHs) from the Scylla survey in approximately 98,000 pc^2 and 75,000 pc^2 of the SMC and LMC, respectively, using deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging (80% complete to more than 1 mag below the ancient main-sequence turnoff, 25.1 and 26.0 mag in F475W and F814W) from 74 pointings. We group the fields into eight sub-regions in the SMC and seven in the LMC. We use the birth rate parameter to identify bursts of star formation and measure their properties in each sub-region. Our methodology provides a standardized framework for burst identification and reveals both broad and fine burst characteristics. We identify global and local bursts, defined as those occurring in at least half or less than half of a galaxy's sub-regions, respectively. In the SMC we find two global (about 5 and 1.5 Gyr ago) and one local burst (about 3 Gyr ago). In the LMC we find one global burst (about 3 Gyr ago). Comparing these findings with dynamical models of the LMC and SMC orbital histories, we find that when models predict a shared dynamical trigger for bursts across both galaxies, the burst begins earlier in the SMC with a greater enhancement in star formation rate than in the LMC. Finally, using age-metallicity relations (AMRs) and cumulative SFHs, we report that the Wing/Bridge region in the SMC resembles the southwestern LMC both chemically and in stellar mass assembly over the last about 7 Gyr, possibly due to stellar material stripped from the LMC during their last interaction.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) The bimodality between star-forming discs and quiescent spheroids requires the existence of two main processes: the galaxy quenching and the morphological transformation. In this paper, we aim to understand the link between these processes and their relation with the stellar mass of galaxies and their local environment. Taking advantage of the first data released by the Euclid Collaboration, covering more than 60 deg2 with space-based imaging and photometry, we analyse a mass-complete sample of nearly one million galaxies in the range 0.25<z<1 with $M_\ast>10^{9.5} M_\odot$. We divide the sample into four sub-populations of galaxies, based on their star-formation activity and morphology. We then analyse the physical properties of these populations and their relative abundances in the stellar mass vs. local density plane. Together with confirming the passivity-density relation and the morphology-density relation, we find that quiescent discy galaxies are more abundant in the low-mass regime of high-density environment. At the same time, star-forming bulge-dominated galaxies are more common in field regions, preferentially at high masses. Building on these results and interpreting them through comparison with simulations, we propose a scenario where the evolution of galaxies in the field significantly differs from that in higher-density environments. The morphological transformation in the majority of field galaxies takes place before the onset of quenching and is mainly driven by secular processes taking place within the main sequence, leading to the formation of star-forming bulge-dominated galaxies as intermediate-stage galaxies. Conversely, quenching of star formation precedes morphological transformation for most galaxies in higher-density environments. This causes the formation of quiescent disc-dominated galaxies before their transition into bulge-dominated ones.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been observed in dwarf galaxies, yet the impact of black hole feedback in these low-mass systems remains unclear. To uncover the potential effects of AGN in the low-mass galaxy regime, we study the properties and demographics of active dwarf galaxies at $z=0$, using the IllustrisTNG simulations. We use data from the TNG50-1 simulation, selecting central galaxies with stellar masses in the range $8 \leq \log(M_\ast/{\rm M_\odot}) \leq 9.5$, and selecting AGN based on their Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$). We analyzed the properties and environment of AGN host galaxies and compared them with inactive control galaxies. The AGN fractions found in the simulation depend strongly on the threshold for $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ in the AGN selection, ranging from $\sim$ 1\% ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \geq 0.05$) to $\sim$ 24\% ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \geq 0.01$). In comparison with non-AGN galaxies of similar stellar and halo mass, dwarf AGN hosts are deficient in neutral gas, having $\sim$ 3.9 times less neutral mass, in qualitative agreement with observations. The dearth in neutral gas is stronger beyond two stellar half-mass radii ($r \gtrsim 3$ kpc), and AGN hosts have more extended gas components than non-AGN galaxies, with a gas half-mass radius, on average, $\gtrsim$ 10 kpc larger. AGN hosts are also slightly less star-forming, but have no differences in local environment. We found that AGN can significantly decrease the neutral gas component of dwarf galaxies, a direct effect of the high-accretion feedback mode employed in IllustrisTNG. However, it is important to test our findings with observations to unveil the complete role of AGN in dwarf galaxies. In TNG50, dwarf AGN fractions are an order of magnitude larger than those observed, motivating a detailed investigation to precisely quantify the mismatch between simulations and observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the large statistics provided by both Euclid and the LOFAR surveys, we present the first large-scale study of the connection between radio emission, its morphology, and the merging properties of the hosts of radio sources up to z=2. By dividing the radio sample into active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies, we find that radio-emitting AGN show a clear preference to reside within galaxies undergoing a merging event. This is more significant for AGN that present extended and/or complex radio emission: indeed, about half of them are associated with merging systems, while only 15% are hosted by an isolated galaxy. The observed trend is primarily driven by AGN residing at z < 1, especially in the case of high - P144MHz > 10^24 W Hz-1 sr-1 - radio luminosities (60% in mergers versus 10% isolated regardless of radio appearance). The situation is reversed in the case of radio-emitting star-forming galaxies, which are preferentially associated with isolated systems. This is more significant as we move towards low radio-luminosity/star-formation objects (P144MHz < 10^23 W Hz-1 sr-1) for which we find 40% in isolated systems versus 20% in mergers. These values hold regardless of redshift. We interpret the above result for AGN with their need to accrete outer gas from local encounters in order to trigger (radio) activity, especially in the case of extended radio emission such as hot-spots and lobes. This is mostly observed at z < 1, since in the local Universe galaxies are more gas deprived than their higher-redshift counterparts. Internal gas reservoirs instead seem sufficient to trigger star formation within the majority of galaxies, which indeed prefer to be associated with isolated systems at all redshifts probed.

 - **Abstract**
 The first Euclid Quick Data Release contains millions of galaxies with excellent optical and near-infrared (IR) coverage. To complement this dataset, we investigate the average far-IR properties of Euclid-selected main sequence (MS) galaxies using existing Herschel and SCUBA-2 data. We use 17.6deg$^2$ (2.4deg$^2$) of overlapping Herschel (SCUBA-2) data, containing 2.6 million (240000) MS galaxies. We bin the Euclid catalogue by stellar mass and photometric redshift and perform a stacking analysis following SimStack, which takes into account galaxy clustering and bin-to-bin correlations. We detect stacked far-IR flux densities across a significant fraction of the bins. We fit modified blackbody spectral energy distributions in each bin and derive mean dust temperatures, dust masses, and star-formation rates (SFRs). We find similar mean SFRs compared to the Euclid catalogue, and we show that the average dust-to-stellar mass ratios decreased from z$\simeq$1 to the present day. Average dust temperatures are largely independent of stellar mass and are well-described by the function $T_2+(T_1-T_2){\rm e}^{-t/\tau}$, where $t$ is the age of the Universe, $T_1=79.7\pm7.4$K, $T_2=23.2\pm0.1$K, and $\tau=1.6\pm0.1$Gyr. We argue that since the dust temperatures are converging to a non-zero value below $z=1$, the dust is now primarily heated by the existing cooler and older stellar population, as opposed to hot young stars in star-forming regions at higher redshift. We show that since the dust temperatures are independent of stellar mass, the correlation between dust temperature and SFR depends on stellar mass. Lastly, we estimate the contribution of the Euclid catalogue to the cosmic IR background (CIB), finding that it accounts for >60% of the CIB at 250, 350, and 500$\mu$m. Forthcoming Euclid data will extend these results to higher redshifts, lower stellar masses, and recover more of the CIB.

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of large spectroscopic surveys, a vast amount of spectra of massive stars will be gathered and supplemented by the wealth of astrometric and photometric data provided by the Gaia satellite. Released data will mean a major step forward in the study of massive stars, giving us the chance to create statistically significant samples to explore the role of almost any parameter. In this contribution, I introduce to the community the Multi-wavelength Exploration of massIve star-forminG regions and ASsociations project (MEIGAS) and long-term plans for conducting comprehensive studies in the major galactic and near extragalactic star-forming regions and OB associations. Benefiting from current and forthcoming data from large scale spectroscopic surveys such as WEAVE and 4MOST (among others), as well as complementary observations at different wavelength ranges, the project aims to achieve crucial and complementary information to adequately characterize these regions and their stellar content, something imperative to improve our understanding of star formation and poorly known evolutionary pathways of massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The hydrodynamic cosmological simulation, TNG50, is employed to conduct an analysis of multi-spin galaxies that exhibit ringed structures composed of gas and stars that orbit nearly perpendicular around a host galaxy, known as polar ring galaxies (PRG). To ensure a robust sample, we select subhalos based on the angle subtended by the angular momentum profiles, as well as on a visual inspection. The analysis is focused on galaxies with stellar masses greater than 10$^{9}$ M$_\odot$. In addition, a dynamic decomposition is employed to separate the stellar and gaseous ring from the host galaxy. This results in a sample of 32 subhalos with PRGs. This sample exhibits properties similar to those observed. These include colours typical of early-type galaxies (ETGs) or those transitioning toward blue systems. Most host galaxies are classified as ETGs, with 37.5\% exhibiting a disk-dominated morphology. The mean bulge-to-total (B/T) ratio is 0.64. Rings have average radii that are 2.36 and 3.41 times larger than their effective radii for the stellar and gaseous components, respectively, with star formation occurring predominantly within the rings. In contrast with observations, rings in the simulation tend to be less massive and slightly less perpendicular. The obtained sample displays a variety of host galaxy morphologies, including wide and narrow rings, providing a robust framework for studying the varied structural characteristics of PRG variants.

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid growth of cislunar activities, including lunar landings, the Lunar Gateway, and in-space refueling stations, requires advances in cost-efficient trajectory design and reliable integration of navigation and remote sensing. Traditional Earth-Moon transfers suffer from rigid launch windows and high propellant demands, while Earth-based GNSS systems provide little to no coverage beyond geostationary orbit. This limits autonomy and environmental awareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer strategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel efficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic missions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is highlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition and digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables adaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and decision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced Positioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation capabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for mapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems support autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated satellite swarm operations. Combining these developments establishes a scalable framework for sustainable cislunar exploration and long-term human and robotic presence.
#### Formation of Free-Floating Planets via Ejection: Population Synthesis with a Realistic IMF and Comparison to Microlensing Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Microlensing observations suggest that the mass distribution of free-floating planets (FFPs) follows a declining power-law with increasing mass. The origin of such distribution is unclear. Using a population synthesis framework, we investigate the formation channel and properties of FFPs, and compare the predicted mass function with observations. Assuming FFPs originate from planet-planet scattering and ejection in single star systems, we model their mass function using a Monte Carlo based planet population synthesis model combined with N-body simulations. We adopt a realistic stellar initial mass function, which naturally results in a large fraction of planetary systems orbiting low-mass stars. The predicted FFP mass function is broadly consistent with observation: it follows the observed power-law at higher masses ($10 \lesssim m/M_\oplus < 10^4$), while at lower masses ($0.1 < m/M_\oplus \lesssim 10$) it flattens, remaining marginally consistent with the lower bound of the observational uncertainties. Low-mass, close-in planets tend to remain bound, while Neptune-like planets at wide orbits dominate the ejected population due to their large Hill radii and shallow gravitational binding. We also compare the mass distribution of bound planets with microlensing observations and find reasonably good agreement with both surveys. Our model predicts $\simeq 1.20$ ejected planets per star in the mass range of $0.33 < m/M_\oplus < 6660$, with a total FFP mass of $\simeq 17.98~M_\oplus$ per star. Upcoming surveys will be crucial in testing these predictions and constraining the true nature of FFP populations.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the transient black hole binary MAXI J1631--479 in its soft spectral state observed simultaneously by the NICER and NuSTAR instruments. Its puzzling feature is the presence of a strong and broad Fe K line, while the continuum consists of a strong disk blackbody and a very weak power-law tail. The irradiation of the disk by a power-law spectrum fitting the tail is much too weak to account for the strong line. Two solutions were proposed in the past. One invoked an intrinsic Fe K disk emission, and the other invoked disk irradiation by the returning blackbody emission. We instead find that the strong line is naturally explained by the irradiation of the disk by the spectrum from Comptonization of the disk blackbody by coronal relativistic electrons. The shape of the irradiating spectrum at $\lesssim$10 keV reflects that of the disk blackbody; it is strongly curved and has a higher flux than that of a fit with a power-law irradiation. That flux accounts for the line. While this result is independent of the physical model used for the disk intrinsic emission, the value of the fitted spin strongly depends on it. When using a Kerr disk model for a thin disk with a color correction, the fitted spin corresponds to a retrograde disk, unlikely for a Roche-lobe overflow binary. Then, a model accounting for both the disk finite thickness and radiative transfer yields a spin of $a_*\approx0.8$--0.9, which underlines the strong model-dependence of X-ray spin measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Free-floating planets are thought to be numerous in the Galaxy and may retain their moons after ejection from their natal systems. If those satellites acquire or preserve orbital eccentricity, tidal dissipation could provide a long-lasting internal heat source, potentially creating urable environments (capable of enabling abiogenesis) in the absence of stellar radiation. We explore (i) whether moons remain bound to planets expelled by a core-collapse supernova, (ii) how the explosion reshapes their orbits, and (iii) under which circumstances tidal heating can sustain urable subsurface oceans. We carried out three-dimensional N-body simulations with an 8th-order Runge-Kutta scheme, modelling homologous stellar mass loss for progenitors of 10 M$_{\odot}$. Post-explosion orbital elements of single moons and resonant moon systems were analysed, and tidal heating power was estimated with a constant phase-lag model for several tidal dissipation functions and moon densities. All simulated moons survive the supernova and remain bound to their planets. The explosion excites moon eccentricities up to $\sim7\times10^{-4}$ and $\sim3\times10^{-3}$ for single moons of planets with circular and eccentric orbits, respectively. For resonant pairs, an eccentricity of $\leq2\times10^{-2}$ is preserved. The semi-major axis of the moons changes by $\leq0.2\%$. For 12-15\% of cases -- preferentially moons at $a\leq15\,R_{\mathrm{planet}}$ and with $e\geq10^{-3}$ -- the specific tidal heating power lies between 0.1 and 10 times what is estimated on Europa or Enceladus, sufficient to maintain liquid oceans beneath an ice crust. Eccentricity damping timescales exceed the age of the Solar System for $a\geq10\,R_{\mathrm{planet}}$, implying billions of years of continuous heating on the moons. Such worlds represent promising targets for future searches for extraterrestrial life.

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of the population of compact objects created in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are uncertain. X-ray observations years to decades after the explosions offer a way to gain insight into this, as hard X-ray emission from the central regions will emerge as the ejecta absorption decreases. Here we analyze and place upper limits on late-time X-ray emission in 242 nearby SNe, using 607 observations from Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift, and NuSTAR. We use absorption models based on 3D simulations of neutrino-driven explosions to account for absorption of emission from the compact objects by the asymmetric ejecta. We detect X-ray emission from 12 SNe, including four for the first time (SN 1982R, SN 1984J, SN 1992bu, and SN 2003gk), and several of the others at later epochs than before. The X-ray spectra of these SNe are consistent with interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM), with the possible exception of SN 1979C, which shows an additional hard component, as also noted in previous studies at earlier epochs. This emission may be due to a pulsar wind nebula. Using the upper limits in the full sample, we also perform a population synthesis to constrain the fraction of SNe that produce pulsars and the properties of the pulsars themselves. We find that pulsar populations with mean initial spin periods $\gtrsim100\rm~ ms$ are favored. Finally, we note that the high luminosities of several of the SNe with CSM interaction imply interactions with dense shells.
#### Dark-Matter-Powered Population III Evolution: Lifetimes, Rotation, and Quasi-Homogeneity in massive Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Population III stars supplied the first light and metals in the Universe, setting the pace of re-ionisation and early chemical enrichment. In dense haloes their evolution can be strongly influenced by the energy released when WIMPs annihilate inside the stellar core. We follow the evolution of a \(20\,M_\odot\) Population III model with the \textsc{genec} code, adding a full treatment of spin dependent WIMP capture and annihilation. Tracks are calculated for six halo densities from \(10^{8}\) to \(3\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}\) and three initial rotation rates between zero and \(0.4\,v/v_{\mathrm{crit}}\). As soon as the capture product reaches \(\rho_\chi\sigma_{\mathrm{SD}}\simeq2\times10^{-28}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-1}}\), the dark-matter luminosity rivals hydrogen fusion, stretching the main-sequence lifetime from about ten million years to more than a gigayear. The extra time allows meridional circulation to smooth out differential rotation; a star that begins at \(0.4\,v/v_{\mathrm{crit}}\) finishes core hydrogen burning with near solid-body rotation and a helium core almost twice as massive as in the dark-matter-free case. Because the nuclear timescale is longer, chemically homogeneous evolution now sets in at only \(0.2\,v/v_{\mathrm{crit}}\), rather than the \(\gtrsim0.5\,v/v_{\mathrm{crit}}\) required without WIMPs. For a star with \(0.4\,v/v_{\mathrm{crit}}\), the surface hydrogen fraction drops to \(X\!\sim\!0.27\), helium rises to \(Y\!\sim\!0.73\), and primary \(^{14}\mathrm N\) increases by four orders of magnitude at He exhaustion. Moderate rotation combined with plausible dark-matter densities can therefore drive primordial massive stars towards long-lived, quasi-homogeneous evolution with distinctive chemical and spectral signatures.
#### Broad Iron Line as a Relativistic Reflection from Warm Corona in AGN

 - **Abstract**
 We present that the broad feature usually observed in X-ray spectra can be explained by a ray-traced emission from a two-slab system containing a dissipative, warm corona on top of an accretion disk in an AGN. Such an accretion flow is externally illuminated by X-ray radiation from a lamp located above a central SMBH. Thermal lines from highly ionized iron ions (FeXXV and FeXXVI), caused by both internal heating and reflection from the warm corona, can be integrated into an observed broad line profile due to the close vicinity of the SMBH. We investigate the dependence of the broad line profile by varying the SMBH spin parameter, viewing angle, lamp height, and dissipation factor. Our results introduce a new method to probe properties of the warm corona using high-resolution spectroscopic measurements. We use the photoionization code TITAN to compute local ion populations and emission line profiles, and the ray-tracing code GYOTO to include relativistic effects on the outgoing X-ray spectrum. In our models, the temperature of the inner atmosphere covering the disk can reach values of 10^7 - 10^8 K due to internal warm corona dissipation and external illumination, which is adequate for generating the highly ionized iron lines. These lines can undergo significant gravitational redshift near the black hole, leading to a prominent spectral feature centered around 6.4 keV. For all computed models, the relativistic corrections shift highly ionized iron lines to the X-ray region, usually attributed to fluorescent emission from the illuminated skin of an accretion disk. Hence, in the case of a warm corona covering the inner disk regions, the resulting theoretical line profile under strong gravity is a sum of different iron line transitions, and those originating from highly ionized iron contribute the most to the observed total line profile in AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 A remarkable span of frontier astrophysics, from gravitational-wave archaeology to the origin of the elements to interpreting snapshots of the earliest galaxies, depends sensitively on our understanding of massive star formation and evolution in near-pristine, relatively enriched gas. From the surprisingly massive black holes detected by LIGO/Virgo to highly ionized nebulae with peculiar enrichment patterns observed in galaxies at Cosmic Dawn, evidence is mounting that our understanding of massive-star populations at very low metallicity remains critically incomplete. The fundamental limitation is the hand nature has dealt us: only a few star-forming galaxies within $\lesssim$1 Mpc can currently be resolved into individual stars, and none reach the extreme metallicities and star-formation intensities that characterized the early Universe. With an ultraviolet integral-field spectrograph aboard the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), this barrier will finally be broken. HWO will bring rare, actively star-forming, extremely metal-poor dwarf galaxies at $\sim$10-20 Mpc such as I Zw 18 within reach of resolved UV-optical spectroscopy, providing our first direct, statistical view of individual massive stars and the feedback they drive at $>$30 $M_\odot$ and $<$10% $Z_\odot$. This science is deeply synergistic with many next-generation facilities, yet requires the unique combination of spatial resolution and UV/optical sensitivity that only HWO can provide. The massive star science enabled by HWO within the Local Volume represents a transformational advance in our ability to probe the earliest stellar populations - those that seeded the Milky Way and other galaxies with the first heavy elements, and paved the way for life in the transparent, reionized Universe we inhabit today.
