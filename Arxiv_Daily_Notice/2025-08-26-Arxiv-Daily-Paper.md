#### Effects of Halo Anisotropy on Disc Galaxy Encounters

 - **Abstract**
 Spherical galaxy models with radially anisotropic velocity distributions merge faster than their isotropic counterparts. Here we investigate the effects of radially anisotropic haloes on the dynamics of disc galaxy encounters. We use stable galaxy models with isotropic bulges, thin rotating discs, and dark haloes which are either isotropic or radially anisotropic. Our simulations confirm that anisotropy can markedly accelerate orbit decay in galaxy interactions; in particular, radially anisotropic haloes transfer a good deal of orbital angular momentum to internal motions even before the galaxies reach their first pericentre. Consequently, for a given initial orbit, the anisotropic models undergo closer and more violent interactions, and their discs generate more massive tidal features. If real disc galaxies have radially anisotropic haloes, our findings may have implications for estimated merger time-scales and remnant morphology.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary systems surrounded by a circumbinary accretion flow can be subject to strong magnetic fields, potentially altering the character of the accretion flow itself, the evolution of the orbital dynamics, and outflow properties from the system. Here we focus on a regime where magnetic fields become so strong that the outer circumbinary flow becomes magnetically arrested, establishing a (circum)binary magnetically arrested disk ($\textit{BMAD}$) state. Such flows feature quasi-periodic magnetic flux eruptions, power jet-like magnetic tower outflows, and consequently alter the predominant contribution to angular momentum transfer inside the circumbinary disk. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the properties of these flows around equal-mass binary systems on circular orbits ultilizing massively parallel three-dimensional Newtonian magnetohydrodynamics simulations. We investigate the impact of the equation of state and of dynamical cooling, as well as that of the (large-scale) magnetic field topology. Our findings are as follows: (1) A magnetically arrested accretion flow through the cavity can generally be achieved, so long as the initial seed field is strong enough. (2) The cavity, and magnetic flux tube properties and their subsequent propagation are subject to the choice of equation of state/cooling physics. (3) We find tentative evidence that in some regimes the BMAD state, particularly during a flux eruption cycle, can aid shrinking of the binary's orbit. The regimes we explore have implications for multi-messenger transients to stars, supermassive and stellar black hole binaries and their orbital evolution in gaseous environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The dominant mechanisms underlying high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission from galaxies vary by galaxy type. In starbursts, a major contribution comes from neutral pion decay. This is driven by interactions between interstellar gas and hadronic cosmic rays (CRs), which are accelerated in strong shocks associated star formation activity and stellar remnants. Leptonic $\gamma$-ray emission can also arise from electrons directly energized in interstellar shocks, produced via charged pion decays, or emitted by pulsars and their surrounding halos. In quiescent galaxies, pulsars and their halos can represent a major $\gamma$-ray source class, with millisecond pulsars predominantly located in globular clusters (GCs) being particularly important. Recent detections of very high-energy (VHE) emission from Galactic GCs suggests they may also contribute to the TeV $\gamma$-ray flux from evolved galaxies. We consider a scenario where this VHE emission from GCs is powered by electrons accelerated in communal stellar/pulsar wind cluster termination shocks. These electrons undergo inverse Compton scattering as they propagate into GC magnetotails. Our results show that the high-energy emission from GCs can be an important contributor to the GeV and TeV flux from massive, quiescent galaxies. The relative strength of each component depends on the global galactic properties and its evolutionary history.
#### MIDIS: Unveiling the Star Formation History in massive galaxies at $1<z<4.5$ with spectro-photometric analysis

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the star formation histories (SFHs) of a sample of massive galaxies ($M_\star \geq 10^{10} \, M_\odot$) in the redshift range $1 < z < 4.5$. We analyze spectro-photometric data combining broadband photometry from HST and JWST with low-resolution grism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRISS, obtained as part of the MIDIS (MIRI Deep Imaging Survey) program. SFHs are derived through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using two independent codes, BAGPIPES and Synthesizer, under various SFH assumptions. This approach enables a comprehensive assessment of the biases introduced by different modeling choices. The inclusion of NIRISS spectroscopy, even with its low resolution, significantly improves constraints on key physical parameters, such as the mass-weighted stellar age ($t_M$) and formation redshift ($z_{\mathrm{form}}$), by narrowing their posterior distributions. The massive galaxies in our sample exhibit rapid stellar mass assembly, forming 50\% of their mass between $3 \leq z \leq 9$. The highest inferred formation redshifts are compatible with elevated star formation efficiencies ($\epsilon$) at early epochs. Non-parametric SFHs generally imply an earlier and slower mass assembly compared to parametric forms, highlighting the sensitivity of inferred formation timescales to the chosen SFH model, particularly for galaxies at $z < 2$. Quiescent galaxies are, on average, older ($t_M \sim 1.1$ Gyr) and assembled more rapidly at earlier times than their star-forming counterparts. These findings support the ``downsizing'' scenario, in which more massive and passive systems form earlier and more efficiently.
#### Modeling Multiphase Galactic Outflows: A Multifluid Moving Mesh Approach

 - **Abstract**
 Outflows are a key part of the galactic gas cycle and crucial in shaping the star formation activity in their host galaxy. Yet, in simulations of galaxy evolution, modeling these outflows in their multi-phase nature and over the relevant timescales is an unsolved problem. We present a subgrid model for simulating multiphase galactic outflows in efficient, comparatively low-resolution simulations, designed for application in future cosmological simulations. The cold phase (T = 10000 K) is treated as pressureless, and its interaction with the hot phase is captured through source terms representing drag and mixing. These terms are obtained using analytic drag and mixing terms for single clouds and convolving them with a cloud mass distribution consistent with high-resolution simulations. Applied to a setup resembling the starburst galaxy M82, the model reproduces the velocity, density, and mass outflow rates of high-resolution simulations that resolve individual cold clouds. Cold outflows emerge naturally from interactions between the hot wind and cold interstellar clouds, with drag and mixing both contributing to the acceleration. Varying the mixing strength strongly affects outflow properties: stronger mixing enhances mass transfer from hot to cold gas, reduces the hot phase velocity, and accelerates the cold phase, while also influencing the origin and composition of the cold outflow. Weak mixing produces cold gas mostly from preexisting interstellar clouds, whereas stronger mixing leads to substantial cold gas formation from the hot phase. This framework enables efficient simulations of multiphase galactic outflows while retaining key multi-component features of the outflow dynamics.
#### Asteroid Rotation Periods: Statistical Analysis in the Diameter-Spin Distribution

 - **Abstract**
 This study examines the rotational characteristics of asteroids through statistical modeling of the diameter-period relationship. A statistical evaluation of the diameter-period relationship was conducted using a dataset of 34,326 asteroids. Clustering identified three main groups, including a dense cluster below the spin barrier, a population of small, fast-rotating asteroids, and a more diffuse group. Geometric and density-based analyses showed that the densest region consists of objects with diameters from 3 to 10 km and rotation periods between 3 and 9 hours, some of which extend beyond the spin barrier. Polynomial modeling demonstrated that a third-degree fit provides the most stable representation of the overall trend without overfitting. Additionally, an empirical lower boundary was identified and proposed, below which no asteroid was found in either the main sample or the selected targets.
#### XMAGNET : Kinetic, Thermal and Magnetic AGN Feedback in Massive Galaxies at Halo Masses $\sim 10^{13.5}$ M$_\odot$

 - **Abstract**
 The interplay between radiative cooling of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and feedback heating governs the evolution of the universe's most massive galaxies. This paper presents simulations of feedback processes in massive galaxies showing how kinetic, thermal, and magnetic active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback interacts with the CGM under different environmental conditions. We find that in massive galaxies with shallower central gravitational potential and higher CGM pressure (multiphase galaxy; MPG) pure kinetic AGN feedback is most efficient in preventing CGM cooling from becoming catastrophic while maintaining the CGM entropy within the observed range. For the same galaxy, partitioning AGN energy injection into kinetic ($75\%$) and thermal ($25\%$) energy results in an entropy bump within $r\lesssim15$ kpc while also having a larger amount of cold gas extending out to $r\sim80$ kpc. A magnetohydrodynamic MPG run with seed magnetic field in the CGM (1~$\mu$G) and partial magnetised AGN feedback ($1\%$ of total AGN power) also shows a higher entropy (within $r<15$ kpc) and cold gas mass, albeit the cold gas remains constrained within $r\lesssim30$ kpc. For a similarly massive galaxy with deeper potential well and low CGM pressure (single phase galaxy; SPG) our simulations show that for both hydro and MHD runs with partial thermal AGN energy, the feedback mechanism remains tightly self-regulating with centrally concentrated cooling (within $r<1$ kpc). Our simulations of a similar mass galaxy with a deeper potential well and higher CGM pressure (SPG-Cool) show that our AGN feedback mechanism cannot get rid of the high CGM density and pressure and its long term evolution is similar to the multiphase galaxy.
#### RRAT J2325-0530: A Rotating Radio Transient with an Atypical Waiting-time Distribution

 - **Abstract**
 We present 1.25 GHz observations of the rotating radio transient (RRAT) J2325-0530, conducted with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Approximately 60% of detected single pulses occur in clusters of 2 to 5 consecutive bursts. Consequently, the waiting-time distribution between successive single pulses exhibits a pronounced excess at one rotation period, deviating from the exponential distribution expected for a Poisson process. After grouping consecutive bursts into single emission events, the recalculated waiting-time distribution is well described by a Weibull distribution with a shape parameter $k \gtrsim 1$. Monte Carlo simulations incorporating both intrinsic burst on-windows and rotational modulation successfully reproduce the observed one-rotation excess. These results suggest that RRAT J2325-0530 emits through a quasi-random process with on-windows slightly longer than its spin period, modulated by the the rotation of emission beam. Additionally, the polarization position angle shows complex behavior that cannot be fully described by the standard rotating vector model, and several pulses exhibit quasi-periodic micro-structures. Taken together, these features indicate complex magnetospheric dynamics underlying the sporadic emission behavior of RRAT J2325-0530.

 - **Abstract**
 The very high-energy (VHE; $>$100 GeV) radiation carries the signatures of the matter-energy interaction in some of the most extreme astrophysical environments. Considering broad emission line blazars, i.e., flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), the dense photon fields surrounding the relativistic jet can prohibit the particle population from accelerating to very high energies and producing VHE radiation. They can also possibly make the environment opaque for the VHE $\gamma$ rays due to $\gamma\gamma$ pair production, thus explaining the paucity of VHE-detected FSRQs and non-detection of TeV radiation ($>$1 TeV) from them. Here we report, for the first time, a $>$7$\sigma$ detection of an FSRQ, S5 1027+74 ($z=0.123$), in the VHE band, including the first ever detection of TeV emission from an object of this class, using the Fermi Large Area Telescope observations. Its $\gamma$-ray spectrum covering the 100 MeV to 2 TeV band revealed a prominent spectral break with a flat, rising shape above $\sim$10 GeV, a feature never detected from other VHE-detected FSRQs. The radio-to-$\gamma$-ray spectral energy distribution of S5 1027+74 provides strong evidence of a third bump peaking at multi-TeV energies. These enigmatic findings imply that FSRQ jets can accelerate particles to extremely high energies and provide tantalizing clues about the complex radiative environment of relativistic jets.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot accretion disks around massive protostars provide a unique opportunity to study ice-free silicate grains that cannot be investigated in protoplanetary disks. We conduct a self-consistent investigation into grain-size evolution and its impact on (sub)millimeter-wave emission from massive protostellar disks. Our radiative transfer modeling accounts for dust self-scattering and includes vertical temperature gradients in the disk structure. The results show that once silicate grains grow to sizes exceeding the observing wavelength, enhanced scattering dims the disk emission by 20\%--30\% relative to the blackbody emission expected at the disk surface temperature. By comparing our model with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 1.14 mm observations of the disk around the massive protostar GGD27-MM1, we constrain the threshold velocity for collisional fragmentation of silicate grains to approximately 15 m s-1. This fragmentation velocity is lower than the typical maximum collisional velocities in protoplanetary disks around low-mass stars, suggesting that collisional coagulation alone is insufficient for silicate dust to form rocky planetesimals in such environments. Furthermore, our analysis identifies two potential scenarios to better reproduce the bright inner-disk emission of GGD27-MM1. One possibility is that the grain growth is limited to 160 mum by another growth barrier (e.g., collisional bouncing), reducing scattering dimming. Alternatively, the stellar luminosity may be as much as five times higher than current estimates, compensating for the reduced brightness. Future multiwavelength observations, particularly at shorter submillimeter wavelengths, will be crucial to distinguish between these scenarios and further constrain silicate grain coagulation processes in massive protostellar disks.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a Chandra/ACIS-I study of X-ray sources in BOSS 1441, a protocluster at $z=2.32\pm0.02$ that exhibits a prominent overdensity of Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs). Using a 45 ks observation, we identify seven X-ray sources spatially coincident with LAE density peaks. The average X-ray photon index for the seven sources, derived from an absorbed power-law model with Galactic absorption fixed, is 1.49 (ranging from -0.68 to 2.51), corresponding to an average luminosity of $\rm 6.85\times 10^{44}~erg~s^{-1}$ in the rest-frame 2-33 keV band, with individual luminosities spanning $(3.57 - 13.96)\rm\times 10^{44}~erg~s^{-1}$. Three sources exhibit relatively flat spectral slopes. Two are associated with the MAMMOTH-1 nebula, while the third, located at the edge of BOSS 1441 with a $> 5'$ offset from the LAE density peak, resides in a region with a high submillimeter-band density. We estimate the fraction of X-ray detected AGNs among the LAEs to be $11.5^{+3.8}_{-4.6}\%$, approximately double that of previously studied LAEs. This elevated fraction suggests BOSS 1441 is in a mature evolutionary stage, with even higher AGN fractions expected in massive LAEs such as PKS 1138-262. In contrast, the submillimeter galaxy population shows a lower AGN fraction ($6.9^{+6.9}_{-4.5}\%$), consistent with their typically obscured nature. These results indicate that the protocluster's massive galaxies are evolving into the bright red sequence galaxies observed in local clusters, where AGNs likely play a critical role in quenching their star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrochemical models can be greatly simplified, with obvious computational advantages, if the reaction networks for key species can be reduced to a bare minimum. In addition, if chemical equilibrium holds, then simple analytical solutions can be formulated. These have particular advantages in the application to complex models evolving over multi-point spatial grids. In this study, the equilibrium solutions to highly simplified chemical networks for CO and H2O have been re-assessed with particular attention to the formulation of the ice desorption rates in the context of 'three-phase' gas-grain astrochemical models. The analytical solutions have also been updated to account for the chemically inert reservoir of molecules below the surface ice layers, and to include the effects of reactive desorption. We find that a very close match is obtained to the results from detailed three-phase models of the time-dependent astrochemistry, and the abundances are typically accurate to within a factor of two over the entire range of densities and extinction that are applicable to dense clouds and young star-forming regions. In addition, these solutions give accurate results over most of the range of conditions even for systems undergoing rapid dynamical evolution. Although there are some caveats of applicability, we therefore recommend that these solutions be used in models of cold molecular environments where the rapid calculation of the abundances of CO, H2O and atomic coolants is helpful.
#### The Impact of Axion-Like Particles on Late Stellar Evolution From Intermediate-Mass Stars to core-collapse Supernova Progenitors

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Stars with masses ranging from 3 to 11 M_\odot exhibit multiple evolutionary paths. Less massive stars in this range conclude their evolution as carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs. However, those that achieve carbon ignition before the pressure by degenerate electron halts the core contraction may either form massive CONe/ONe white dwarfs, or undergo an electron-capture supernova, or photo-disintegrate neon and proceed with further thermonuclear burning, ultimately leading to the formation of a gravitationally unstable iron core. Aims. An evaluation of the impact of the energy loss caused by the production of axion-like-particles (ALPs) on evolution and final destiny of these stars is the main objective of this paper. Methods. We compute various sets of stellar models, all with solar initial composition, varying the strengths of the ALP coupling with photons and electrons. Results. As a consequence of an ALP thermal production, the critical masses for off-center C and Ne ignitions are both shifted upward. When the current bounds for the ALP coupling strengths are assumed, the maximum mass for CO WD progenitors is about 1.1 M_\odot heavier than that obtained without the ALP energy loss, while the minimum mass for a core collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitor is 0.7 M_\odot higher. Conclusions. Current constraints from observed Type II-P supernova light curves and pre-explosive luminosity do not exclude an ALP production within the current bounds. However, the maximum age of CCSN progenitors, as deduced from the star formation rate of the parent stellar population, would require a smaller minimum mass. This discrepancy can be explained by assuming a moderate extra mixing (as due to core overshooting or rotational induced mixing) above the fully convective core that develops during the main sequence.

 - **Abstract**
 The classic model of the Local Group (LG) is that of two dominant constituents, the Milky Way and M31, first separating and then detaching from the Hubble flow, leading to a nearly radial approaching orbit. This simple model has been confronted by new measurements of the 3D M31 kinematics, by cosmological simulations, and by theoretical understanding of the impact of massive substructures such as the Large Magellanic Cloud. This article explores the consequences of new observations and theory on the determination of the mass and dynamics of the LG. The M31 tangential velocity measurement and contribution from the cosmological constant both increase the implied timing mass of the LG to be $\sim 5 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$. Timing mass estimates for the LG tend to be larger than the sum of the Milky Way and M31 halo masses, and larger than independent LG mass estimators. Precision future kinematics have the potential to explore the origin of this difference, shed light on dark matter in the LG, the origin of its angular momentum, and possibly even local values of cosmological parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We detail the population properties of merging compact objects using 158 mergers from the cumulative Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0, which includes three types of binary mergers: binary neutron star, neutron star--black hole binary, and binary black hole mergers. We resolve multiple over- and under-densities in the black hole mass distribution: features persist at primary masses of $10\,M_\odot$ and $35\,M_\odot$ with a possible third feature at $\sim 20\,M_\odot$. These are departures from an otherwise power-law-like continuum that steepens above $35\,M_\odot$. Binary black holes with primary masses near $10\,M_\odot$ are more likely to have less massive secondaries, with a mass ratio distribution peaking at $q = 0.74^{+0.13}_{-0.13}$, potentially a signature of stable mass transfer during binary evolution. Black hole spins are inferred to be non-extremal, with 90\% of black holes having $\chi < 0.57$, and preferentially aligned with binary orbits, implying many merging binaries form in isolation. However, we find a significant fraction, 0.24--0.42, of binaries have negative effective inspiral spins, suggesting many could be formed dynamically in gas-free environments. We find evidence for correlation between effective inspiral spin and mass ratio, though it is unclear if this is driven by variation in the mode of the distribution or the width. (Abridged)
#### A$^3$COSMOS: The dust content of massive quiescent galaxies and its evolution with cosmic time

 - **Abstract**
 We study the dust content of massive ($\log(M_*/M_{\odot})\geq10.8$) quiescent galaxies (QGs) at redshift $z=0.5-3$ to place constraints on the evolution of their cold interstellar medium (ISM), and thereby obtain insights on the processes of galaxy quenching throughout cosmic time. We use a robust sample of 458 colour-selected QGs covered by the A$^3$COSMOS+A$^3$GOODSS database to perform a stacking analysis in the $uv$-domain and measure their mean dust masses from their stacked submillimetre luminosities. We use the CIGALE SED-fitting code to obtain star formation histories and infer the time since quenching for all QGs in our sample. We use this information to gain insight on the time evolution of the dust content after quenching. Most QGs in our sample quenched around a redshift of $z\sim1.3$, following the peak of cosmic star formation. The majority of QGs observed at $z>1$ are recently quenched (i.e., quenched for no longer than $500\,$Myr), whereas the majority of QGs observed at $z<1$ have already been quenched for a significant amount of time ($\gtrsim1\,$Gyr). This implies that high-redshift galaxies ($z\gtrsim2$) are ideal for studying the mechanisms of quenching and its effects on the ISM, while lower-redshift galaxies are more suitable for studying the long-term effects of the QG environment on their ISM. We obtain upper limits on the dust mass fraction of the QG population, pointing towards lower dust content in high-redshift massive QGs than found by earlier stacking studies, and significantly lower (by a factor $\sim2-6$) than that of normal star forming galaxies. We also place constraints on the initial gas fraction right after quenching. We find that within the first $\sim600\,$Myr after quenching, QGs already lose on average $\gtrsim70\%$ of their cold ISM. Our findings support a gas consumption or removal scenario acting on short timescales.

 - **Abstract**
 We use Magellan/MIKE echelle spectroscopy to conduct an in-depth chemodynamical analysis of the most luminous star-forming region within the metal-poor starburst dwarf galaxy CGCG 007-025. Leveraging the exceptional high resolution (R$\sim$50,000) and broad wavelength coverage, we apply Bayesian inference to simultaneously model the fluxes of 30 emission lines spanning the wavelength range 3400-9200Å. Employing a two-region ionisation model, we characterise various gas properties including electron temperature, electron density, and chemical abundances across different elements. Our direct-method inferred metallicity yields $\rm 12+\log(O/H)=7.77\pm0.03$, placing the galaxy in the metal-poor regime. Furthermore, Metal-to-Oxygen ratios such as log(S/O), log(Ne/O) or log(Ar/O) are in full agreement with the values derived for the Milky Way, consistent with expectations from stellar evolutionary models. The brightest emission lines are kinematically complex, with modelling requiring up to four distinct components. The exceptional resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the data unveil asymmetric and wide ($\sigma_{HeII} \approx$ 35km/s) HeII$\lambda$4686 emission. The flux ratio of this nebular line, together with the absence of other high ionisation species such as [NeV]$\lambda$3426, indicates the presence of fast radiative shocks.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a method for the detection and characterization of random changes in the flux from $\gamma$-ray pulsars on sub-hour timescales, much shorter than variations that can be accessed using direct flux measurements. Flux variations are a proxy for the variations in spindown power ($\dot{E}$) or particle acceleration, which can be produced by random switches between quasi-stable configurations of the pulsar magnetosphere. This technique therefore probes the stability of pulsar magnetospheres and discrete spindown states on timescales much shorter than can be achieved with pulsar timing. We apply the method to a sample of 115 bright $\gamma$-ray pulsars, finding no new instances of state changes. We derive the sensitivity of the method and find that, for a wide range of possible state changing models, over a wide range of timescales, we can limit the amplitude of flux ($\dot{E}$) variations to $<$10%. Substantial nulling is excluded in nearly all cases. The best cases limit variations of any sort to $\leq$1%. These results indicate that $\gamma$-ray pulsar magnetospheres maintain a single configuration or narrow range of configurations with nearly constant power output.
