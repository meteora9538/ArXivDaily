 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological simulations predict significant secondary dependencies of halo clustering on internal properties and environment. Detecting these subtle signals in observational data remains challenging, with important ramifications for galaxy evolution and cosmology. We probe secondary halo bias in observational survey data, using galaxy groups as dark matter halo proxies. We quantify secondary bias using central galaxy colour and environmental diagnostics. We use an extended, refined galaxy group catalogue from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Secondary bias is defined as any deviation in group clustering strength at fixed mass, quantified through the projected two-point correlation function. Our environmental analysis uses DisPerSE to compute distances to critical points of the density field, incorporating local group overdensity measurements on multiple scales. We robustly detect several forms of secondary bias in the clustering of galaxy groups. At fixed mass, groups hosting red central galaxies are more strongly clustered than those with blue centrals, with $b_{\rm relative}$ ranging from $\sim 1.2$ for the 15\% reddest centrals to $\sim 0.8$ for the bluest ones. Environmental dependencies based on cosmic-web distances are also present, though significantly weaker and largely mass-independent. The strongest signal arises from local overdensity: groups in the densest 15\% of environments reach $b_{\rm relative} \sim 1.4$, while those in the least dense regions fall to $b_{\rm relative} \sim 0.7$. These results establish a clear observational hierarchy for secondary halo bias. The colour of central galaxies correlates with the local group overdensity, which, in turn, correlates with the bias at fixed group mass. Assuming that central galaxy colour traces halo assembly history, this three-stage picture offers a conceptual link between our results and halo assembly bias.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the mass-metallicity relation for star-forming galaxies in the MUSE Quasar Nebula 01 (MQN01) field, a massive cosmic web node at $z \sim 3.245$, hosting one of the largest overdensities of galaxies and AGNs found so far at $z > 3$. Through James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) spectra and images from JWST and Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we identify a sample of 9 star-forming galaxies in the MQN01 field with detection of nebular emission lines ($\rm H\beta$, [OIII], $\rm H\alpha$, [NII]), covering the mass range of $\rm 10^{7.5}M_\odot - 10^{10.5}M_\odot$. We present the relations of the emission-line flux ratios versus stellar mass for the sample and derive the gas-phase metallicity based on the strong line diagnostics of [OIII]$\lambda5008$/$\rm H\beta$ and [NII]$\lambda6585$/$\rm H\alpha$. Compared to the typical, field galaxies at similar redshifts, MQN01 galaxies show relatively higher [NII]$\lambda6585$/$\rm H\alpha$ and lower [OIII]$\lambda5008$/$\rm H\beta$ at the same stellar mass, which implies a higher metallicity by about $0.25\pm 0.07$ dex with respect to the field mass-metallicity relation. These differences are decreased considering the ``Fundamental Metallicity Relation'', i.e. if the galaxies' Star Formation Rates (SFR) are also taken into account. We argue that these results are consistent with a scenario in which galaxies in overdense regions assemble their stellar mass more efficiently (or, equivalently, start forming at earlier epochs) compared to field galaxies at similar redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 The translation from direct observables to physical properties of galaxies is a key step in reconstructing their evolutionary histories. Variations in stellar populations and star-dust geometry can induce inhomogeneous mass-to-light ratios, complicating this process. SE3D is a novel modelling framework, built around a radiative transfer emulator, aimed at tackling this problem. In this paper, we test the ability of SE3D to recover known intrinsic properties of toy model and TNG50 simulated galaxies from mock observations of their multi-wavelength photometric and structural properties. We find an encouraging performance for several key characteristics, including the bulk stellar mass, dust mass and SFR, as well as their respective radial extents. We point out limitations, and investigate the impact of various sources of model mismatch. Among them, mismatch in the shapes of star formation histories contributes most, with radial and azimuthal structure and stellar metallicity distributions playing a progressively more minor role. We also analyse the evolution from z=2 to z=0 of resolved stellar and dust properties of TNG galaxies, as measured intrinsically and expressed in their distribution across UVJ and IRX-$\beta$ diagnostic diagrams. We test different methods to assign dust to the simulation, and find a persistent lack of Mdust/Mstar evolution and a more limited dynamic range across the diagnostic diagrams compared to observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova (SN) feedback-driven galactic outflows are a key physical process that contributes to the baryon cycle by regulating the star formation activity, reducing the amount of metals in low-mass galaxies and enriching the circumgalactic (CGM) and intergalactic media (IGM). We aim to understand the chemical loop of sub-Milky Way (MW) galaxies and their nearby regions. We studied 15 simulated central sub-MW galaxies (M* <= 10^10 Msun) and intermediate-mass galaxies (M* \sim 10^10 Msun) from the CIELO-P7 high-resolution simulations. We followed the evolution of the progenitor galaxies, their properties and the characteristics of the outflows within the redshift range z = [0, 7]. We used two dynamically-motivated outflow definitions, unbound outflows and expelled mass rates, to quantify the impact of SN feedback. At z \sim 0, sub-MW galaxies have a larger fraction of their current oxygen mass in the gas phase but have expelled a greater portion beyond the virial radius, compared to their higher-mass counterparts. Galaxies with M* <\sim 10^9 Msun have 10-40 per cent of their total oxygen mass within R200 in the CGM, and an equivalent to 10-60 per cent expelled into the IGM. In contrast, more massive galaxies have most of the oxygen mass locked by the stellar populations. The CGM of low-mass galaxies predominantly contains oxygen low-temperature gas, acting as a metal reservoir. We find that the outflows are more oxygen-rich for sub-MW galaxies, Zout/ZISM \sim 1.5, than for higher-mass galaxies, Zout/ZISM <= 0.5, particularly for z < 2. Mass-loading factors of eta_out \sim 0 - 6 are detected in agreement with observations (abridged).

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the vertical and radial structure of mono-age stellar populations in three edge-on lenticular galaxies (FCC 153, FCC 170, and FCC 177) in the Fornax cluster, using deep MUSE observations. By measuring the half-mass radius (R$_{50}$) and half-mass height (z$_{50}$) across 1 Gyr-wide age bins, we trace the spatial evolution of stellar populations over cosmic time. All galaxies exhibit a remarkably constant disc thickness for all stars younger than ~6 Gyr, suggesting minimal secular heating and limited impact from environmental processes such as tidal shocking or harassment. Evidence of past mergers (8-10 Gyr ago) is found in the increase of z$_{50}$ for older populations. We find that accreted (metal-poor) stars have been deposited in quite thick configurations, but that the interactions only moderately thickened pre-existing stars in the galaxies, and only caused mild flaring in the outer regions of the discs. The radial structure of the discs varies across galaxies, but in all cases we find that the radial extent of mono-age populations remains constant or grows over the past 8 Gyr. This leads us to argue that within the radial range we consider, strangulation, rather than ram-pressure stripping, is the dominant quenching mechanism in those galaxies. Our results highlight the usefulness of analysing the structure of mono-age population to uncover the mechanisms driving galaxy evolution, and we anticipate broader insights from the GECKOS survey, studying 36 nearby edge-on disc galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the ionized gas kinematics and feedback properties in a sample of 14 low-mass, UV-luminous Lyman Break Analogs (LBAs) at redshifts z~0.1-0.3. These compact, strongly star-forming galaxies serve as local analogs of high-redshift starbursts. Using high-resolution VLT/X-shooter spectra, we model the optical emission-line profiles, including [O III] 4959,5007 and the Balmer lines, with multi-component Gaussian fits. All galaxies show complex kinematics that require both narrow (sigma < 90 km/s) and broad (sigma > 90 km/s) components. The narrow components trace highly turbulent gas associated with massive star-forming regions, while the broad components indicate ionized outflows driven by stellar winds and supernova feedback, with outflow velocities of about 200-500 km/s. Estimated mass outflow rates range from 0.20 to 2.72 solar masses per year, with mass-loading factors between 0.03 and 0.81. We find a mild increase in mass loading toward lower stellar masses, as well as a strong correlation between mass loading and star-formation-rate surface density, suggesting that more compact starbursts drive more powerful outflows. These trends are consistent with those seen in star-forming galaxies at higher redshifts. Our results highlight the importance of local UV-compact starbursts for understanding feedback processes in low-mass, rapidly star-forming galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the origin of the scatter in the stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation using the \colibre cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. At fixed halo mass, we find a clear positive correlation between stellar mass and halo concentration, particularly in low-mass haloes between $10^{11}$ and $10^{12}\,\rm M_\odot$, where all halo properties are computed from the corresponding dark-matter-only simulation. Two scenarios have been proposed to explain this trend: the earlier formation of higher-concentration haloes allows more time for star formation, or the deeper gravitational potential wells of higher-concentration haloes enhance baryon retention. To distinguish between them, we examine correlations between halo concentration, stellar mass, stellar age, and stellar metallicity. While, at fixed halo mass, halo concentration correlates with stellar age, stellar age itself shows only a weak correlation with stellar mass, indicating that early formation alone cannot account for the concentration-dependence in the scatter of the SMHM relation. In contrast, both stellar metallicity and halo concentration exhibit correlations with stellar mass. The connection between halo concentration and stellar metallicity persists even when simultaneously controlling for both halo mass and stellar mass. These results support the scenario in which the deeper gravitational potentials in higher-concentration haloes suppress feedback-driven outflows, thereby enhancing both baryon and metal retention.

 - **Abstract**
 We characterize star-forming gas in six molecular clouds (Sgr B1-off, Sgr B2, Sgr C, the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds, and the Brick) in the Galactic central molecular zone (CMZ), and compare their star-forming activities with those in molecular clouds outside the CMZ. Using multi-band continuum observations taken from ${\it Planck}$, ${\it Herschel}$, JCMT/SCUBA-2, and CSO/SHARC2, we derived 8.5" resolution column density maps for the CMZ clouds and evaluated the column density probability distribution functions (N-PDFs). With the archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm dust continuum data, we further evaluated the mass of the most massive cores ($M_{\rm core}^{\rm ma x}$). We find that the N-PDFs of four of the selected CMZ clouds are well described by a piecewise log-normal + power-law function, while the N-PDFs of the remaining two can be approximated by log-normal functions. In the first four targets, the masses in the power-law component ($M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$), $M_{\rm core}^{\rm max}$, and star formation rate (SFR) are correlated. These correlations are very similar to those derived from low-mass clouds in the Solar neighborhood and massive star-forming regions on the Galactic disk. These findings lead to our key hypotheses: (1) In the extreme environment of the CMZ, the power-law component in the N-PDF also represents self-gravitationally bound gas structures, and (2) evolution and star-forming activities of self-gravitationally bound gas structures may be self-regulated, insensitive to the exterior environment on $\gtrsim$5-10 pc scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission is commonly attributed to non-thermal radiation processes operating in the optically thin regions of a relativistic outflow. Among these, optically thin inverse-Compton (IC) scattering remains an important yet under-tested mechanism. From an initial set of 41 bursts selected using empirical Band-function criteria that highlight quasi-thermal low-energy slopes ($\alpha > -0.5$) and constrained high-energy indices ($-1.7 > \beta > -3.3$), only four events satisfy these conditions consistently in both time-integrated and time-resolved spectra. The IC fits yield self-consistent constraints on the seed-photon field and the electron population at the dissipation site. For bulk Lorentz factors $\Gamma \sim 170$-$550$, we infer seed thermal peaks of $\sim 0.05$-$0.2$ keV and electron thermal energies of $\sim 20$-$300$ keV in the co-moving frame. A fraction of only $0.1\%$-$20\%$ of electrons are accelerated into a non-thermal tail with an average index value of $\delta \sim 1.8$. The derived Comptonisation parameters indicate moderate $y$ values ($\sim 1$-$3$), optical depths $\tau \sim 0.2$-$0.6$, and dissipation radii just above the photosphere, consistent with mildly relativistic ($\gamma_{\min} \sim 1.2$-$2.6$), photon-dominated, low-magnetic-field dissipation environments. Furthermore, the framework allows us to constrain even sub-dominant thermal components that lie below the detector's low-energy threshold. Taken together, our results show that optically thin IC scattering offers a physically consistent and observationally viable explanation for the prompt emission in a subset of bright GRBs, motivating the application of IC models in future GRB studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discoveries have unveiled an abundance of faint and massive Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at high redshifts (z=4-9), that surpass by 10 to 100 times the extrapolated bolometric (Bol) and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions (LF) from previous AGN campaigns. The two main models that are put forward to explain these observations correspond to light seeds (150 Msol) accreting in episodes of super Eddington, and heavy seeds ($10^3$ - $10^5$ Msol) growing at the Eddington limit. Future gravitational observatories like the Laser Interferometer Satellite Antenna (LISA) will help disentangle these models by reporting the BH-BH merger events from mid to high redshifts. Aims. This work aims to report the predicted merger rates in the heavy seed scenario in light of recent JWST data. In our models we explore (i) instantaneous merging between BHs, (ii) delayed merging after a dynamical timescale, as well as extreme spin configurations (a=0.99, a=-0.99) to bracket BH mass growth. Methods. We use Delphi, a semi-analytical model that tracks baryonic physics over a hierarchical evolution of dark matter halos through cosmic time within the first billion years of the Universe. We calibrate this model for it to simultaneously reproduce galaxy and JWST-AGNs observables. Results. We show reasonable agreement with the Bolometric Luminosity function at z=6, where BHs must accrete 10-100 times more gas than in previous works calibrated to pre-JWST data. However, we underpredict (overpredict) the bright end $10^45.5$ erg s$^-1$ (all luminosity range) at z=7 (z=5) by 1-3.2 dex (0.22-1.6 dex). Regarding BH-BH merger events, the instantaneous (delayed) models predict a total of 28.06 (19.61) yr$^-1$ for BHs at z>=5, which is within the range of merger rates reported in previous literature.

 - **Abstract**
 Intermittent jet activity of AGNs is a common phenomenon, whereas significant jet reorientation during episodic jet activity in relatively young radio galaxies are rarely reported. The quasar 0954+556 at redshift of 0.903 is an intriguing source exhibiting an unusual radio jet structure with significantly different jet directions at kpc and pc scales. At kpc scales, images from the VLA exhibit a bright core, a linear jet extending 24 kpc to the northwest, and a discrete jet component 16 kpc to the northeast. At pc scales, images from the VLBA show a two-component structure with a projected separation of 360 pc in the north-south direction. The peculiar structure of 0954+556 might result from jet reorientation. Here, our aim was to investigate the possible mechanism via multiscale and multifrequency deep radio images. We performed VLA and VLBA observations of 0954+556. Together with some existing data in the NRAO data archive, we made multiple VLA images at 1.4-22 GHz and VLBA images at 1.7-43 GHz for various image analyses of the jet structure. We identified the location of the radio core at pc scales, detected the faint counter-jets at both pc and kpc scales for the first time, and revealed a diffuse emission region connecting pc and kpc scale forward jets. Our spectral index distribution and spectral aging analysis indicate that 0954+556 might undergo at least two episodes of jet activity during the current AGN phase. Moreover, pc scale polarization maps display a well-resolved spine-sheath polarization structure. It seems that the jet direction of 0954+556 changed significantly during intermittent jet activity. This may explain the different jet orientations and spectral ages observed from kpc to pc scales. The research provides a strong case that AGN jet direction might change rapidly on timescales of one million years.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, have a profound impact on both the Earth's space environment and human activities. As a result, accurate solar flare prediction has emerged as a central topic in space weather research. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in the field of solar flare forecasting, driven by the rapid advancements in space observation technology and the continuous improvement of data processing capabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the current state of research in this area, with a particular focus on tracing the evolution of data-driven approaches -- which have progressed from early statistical learning techniques to more sophisticated machine learning and deep learning paradigms, and most recently, to the emergence of Multimodal Large Models (MLMs). Furthermore, this study examines the realistic performance of existing flare forecasting platforms, elucidating their limitations in operational space weather applications and thereby offering a practical reference for future advancements in technological optimization and system design.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars (mass beyond 8 solMass) release vast amounts of energy into the interstellar medium through their stellar winds, photoionising radiation and supernova explosions. These processes may compress nearby regions, triggering further star formation, but the significance of triggered star formation across the Galactic disc is not well understood. This pilot study combines 1.3 GHz continuum data from the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS) with 13CO (2-1) data from the Structure, Excitation, and Dynamics of the Inner Galactic Interstellar Medium (SEDIGISM) survey to identify and examine molecular clouds associated with H II regions and supernovae remnants (SNRs). We focus on their physical properties and massive star formation potential. We identify 268 molecular clouds from the SEDIGISM tile covering the Galactic plane region between 341 and 343 longitude deg and latitude deg equal to or less 0.5, of which 90 clouds (34 per cent) are associated with SMGPS extended sources. Compared to unassociated clouds, we find that associated clouds exhibit significantly higher mean mass (9600 solMass vs. 2500 solMass ) and average gas surface density (104 solMass / pc^2 vs. 67 solMass / pc^2 ), and slightly elevated but comparable virial parameters. We also find that the size-linewidth scaling relation is steeper for associated clouds compared to unassociated clouds. In addition, radio luminosity shows a positive correlation with total complex mass, and the ratio L_radio/L_complex increases with source size, consistent with an evolutionary sequence where expanding H II regions progressively disrupt their natal molecular environment. These findings suggest an enhanced dynamical activity for the associated clouds and support the hypothesis that feedback from massive stars influences molecular cloud properties and may trigger star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Resonance lines encode rich information about astrophysical sources and their environments, yet fully analytic treatments of multi-line radiative transfer remain almost entirely unexplored. We present exact, closed-form solutions for steady-state resonant-line radiative transfer in "V-shaped" atomic networks, where a single ground state couples to multiple transitions. Starting from the full angle-dependent transfer equation, we generalize absorption and emission coefficients to an arbitrary number of lines, derive a modified Fokker-Planck expansion of the frequency-redistribution COLT Monte Carlo radiative transfer code and find excellent agreement with the analytic predictions across a wide range of line separations, optical depths, and damping parameters, establishing our solutions as stringent validation benchmarks. For concrete applications related to the Lyman-alpha transition of neutral hydrogen, we examine how fine-structure splitting and deuterium injection modify the emergent spectra, internal radiation field, and radiative force multiplier. We show that these effects leave previous conclusions about Lyman-alpha feedback in the early universe essentially unchanged. Even when direct observational diagnostics are subtle, our framework provides novel analytic and numerical insights into coupled resonance-line transport and facilitates progress in general modeling of multi-line radiative transfer in diverse astrophysical settings.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the origin of unidentified, extended TeV source 1LHAASO J0500$+$4454, considering three possible origins: cosmic rays interacting with a molecular cloud (MC), particles accelerated in a currently undetected supernova remnant (SNR), and an energetic outflow powered by a pulsar. Upper limits on the CO and X-ray emission from the $\gamma$-ray emitting region disfavor the MC and SNR scenarios, respectively. If a nebula of inverse Compton scattering $e^{\pm}$ powers 1LHAASO J0500$+$4454, then SED modeling indicates that the current particle energy in the nebula is $\sim 4 \times 10^{48}$ erg. If the coincident magnetar SGR 0501$+$4516's rotational energy powered 1LHAASO J0500$+$4454, then a conservative energy budget calculation requires an initial magnetar spin period $P_{0} \lesssim 5$ ms and a spin-down timescale $\tau_{\rm sd} \lesssim 30$ yr, which has implications for the origins of magnetars.
