#### The Importance of Aqueous Metabolites in the Martian Subsurface for Understanding Habitability, Organic Chemical Evolution, and Potential Biology

 - **Abstract**
 Aqueous metabolites in terrestrial subsurface environments provide critical analog frameworks for assessing the habitability of Martian subsurface ice. On Earth, they play critical roles in sustaining microbial life within soils, permafrost, and groundwater environments and their availability shape microbial community compositions, activity, and adaptability to changes in environmental conditions, enabling communities to persist over millennial timescales. The counterpart to aqueous-soluble organics is the insoluble organic matter pool that makes up the largest portion of organic matter in natural samples and includes most types of organic signatures indicative of biological processes. Employing a range of sample preparation, molecular separation, detection, and imaging techniques enables the characterization of both labile (i.e., soluble and reactive) and recalcitrant (i.e., insoluble, non-reactive; include macromolecules) organic pools. Multiple orthogonal analytical modalities strengthen interpretations of signatures that we associate with biology as we know it and don't know it, by constraining possible abiotic sources, validating measurements across distinct techniques, and ensuring flexibility to interrogate diverse organic chemistries encountered in Martian subsurface environments. This holistic triage approach aligns with the priorities articulated in the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group's Search for Life -Science Analysis Group (SFL-SAG) Charter for a medium-class Mars mission focused on extant life detection.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Many critical physical processes, such as Roche lobe overflow, strain modern simulation methods due to their durations and multidimensionality. Aims. We employ a novel method of time-domain multidimensional simulations to provide the first grid-based time domain 3D model of Roche lobe overflow using VH-1. Methods. Using a piecewise approach which alternates between high-resolution 3D dynamic modeling and computationally fast evolutionary modeling, we present and test a method capable of self-scaling variable time resolution at greatly reduced computational cost. Results. We find mass transfer in the test high mass x-ray binary M33 X-7 to be unstable and fully conservative in both mass and angular momentum transport onto the accretion disk beyond f >~ 1.01. This phase begins on thermal timescales and accelerates to span < 100 yrs beyond f >= 1.1, while the non-conservative stable phase of f <~ 1.01 occurs on roughly nuclear timescales. Conclusions. We identify a critical point f ~ 1.01 which terminates stable overflow, which may correspond to the point Mdot_L1 ~ Mdot_wind or Mdot_L1 ~ 10^-6 M_solar/yr in the general case.
#### Measuring the Mean Plane of the Distant Kuiper Belt

 - **Abstract**
 In the absence of any unseen planetary-mass bodies in the outer solar system, the mean plane of the distant Kuiper belt should be the same as the plane orthogonal to the angular momentum vector of the solar system -- the invariable plane. Here, we measure the mean plane of the non-resonant Kuiper belt across semimajor axes 50 - 400 AU. We introduce a new method to measure the mean plane that we demonstrate to be independent of observational bias. In particular, our results are not biased by surveys that look only at limited areas on the celestial sphere. We find a warp relative to the invariable plane at semimajor axes of 80 - 400 AU (98% confidence) and 80 - 200 AU (96% confidence), but not at 50 - 80 AU or 200 - 400 AU. If it is not spurious, a possible explanation for this warp is an unseen planet in the outer solar system. With $n$-body simulations, we find that a planet with mass between that of Mercury and the Earth, semimajor axis in the range 100 - 200 AU, and inclination $\gtrsim 10^{\circ}$ to be the most likely cause of the warp; however, parameters outside of these ranges are still possible. Such a body is distinct in both mass and semimajor axis from the various versions of an unseen planet invoked to explain apsidal clustering in the outer solar system. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to confirm or deny the existence of the warp reported here, and might detect the planet that may produce it.
#### The implications of overmassive black holes at $z > 5$ for quasar and black hole growth

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST surveys of high-redshift galaxies have found surprisingly large black holes, with many being measured to be $\sim100$ times more massive than local galaxies with the same stellar mass. Here, we find that a population of these black holes would have dramatic implications for our understanding of their growth across cosmic time. We first show that the global black hole mass density at $z \sim 5$ would be comparable to local values. This would not occur if these black holes occupy a small fraction of galaxies, though it would be expected if these black holes radiate at high efficiencies (requiring that the central engines of AGN spin rapidly). We then show that the individual detected $z \sim 5$ black holes would remain overmassive compared to the local relation if they grow according to the average rates of state-of-the-art models. These systems must instead grow at least an order of magnitude more slowly than expected if they are to fall within the observed scatter of the local black hole mass-stellar mass relation. Such slow growth is surprising in comparison to other estimates of the radiative efficiency of AGN, especially because growth must be rapid at $z > 5$ in order to build up such massive black holes quickly. Finally, we highlight the challenges that overmassive black holes have on our understanding of the impact of quasar feedback on galaxies.
#### Ly$α$ visibility from z = 4.5 to 11 in the UDS field: evidence for a high neutral hydrogen fraction and small ionized bubbles at z $\sim$ 7

 - **Abstract**
 The resonant scattering nature of Ly$\alpha$ photons interacting with neutral hydrogen makes Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) robust tracers of the intergalactic neutral hydrogen fraction, and thus sensitive probes of cosmic reionization. We present an extensive study of the Ly$\alpha$ evolution from galaxies at 4.5 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 11 in the UDS field, observed as part of the CAPERS survey, and complemented with spectra from the DAWN JWST Archive. The combined sample includes 651 spectroscopically confirmed Ly$\alpha$-break galaxies, among which we find 73 S/N>3 LAEs in JWST-NIRSpec PRISM spectra. We trace the redshift evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ emitter fraction with EW$_0$ >25 A (X$_{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$) between z = 5 and z = 9, presenting the first such analysis in the UDS field. At z = 5 and 6, the UDS results agree with the average JWST X$_{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ values from multiple fields. However, JWST measurements are consistently lower than ground-based results. To investigate this, we compare JWST observations to a population of star-forming galaxies at z$\sim$6 observed with VLT-FORS2. We find that a Ly$\alpha$ slit-loss of 35 $\pm$ 10% in JWST spectra accounts for the offset, as the resonant Ly$\alpha$ emission is more spatially extended than the stellar continuum. From z = 6 to 7, the UDS field shows a significant drop in Ly$\alpha$ visibility, from which we infer a neutral hydrogen fraction of X$_{\mathrm{HI}}$ = 0.7--0.9. Finally, we identify two robust ionized bubbles at z = 7.29 and 7.77, with radii of $R_{\mathrm{ion}}$ = 0.6 and 0.5 physical Mpc and photometric overdensities of N/$\langle$N$\rangle$ = 3 and 4, based on candidate counts down to the photometric completeness limit. Compared to the large ionized region at z$\sim$7 in the EGS field, these results indicate significant field-to-field variation, supporting a patchy, inhomogeneous reionization process.
#### Crowdsourcing Star-Formation Research and the Power of Participatory Science

 - **Abstract**
 We review participatory science programs that have contributed to the understanding of star formation. The Milky Way Project (MWP), one of the earliest participatory science projects launched on the Zooniverse platform, produced the largest catalog of ``bubbles'' associated with feedback from hot young stars to date, and enabled the identification of a new class of compact star-forming regions (SFRs) known as ``yellowballs'' (YBs). The analysis of YBs through their infrared colors and catalog cross-matching led to discovering that YBs are compact photodissociation regions generated by intermediate- and high-mass young stellar objects embedded in clumps that range in mass from 10 - 10,000 solar masses and luminosity from 10 - 1,000,000 solar luminosities. The MIRION catalog, assembled from 6176 YBs identified by citizen scientists, increases the number of candidate intermediate-mass SFRs by nearly two orders of magnitude. Ongoing work utilizing data from the Spitzer, Herschel and WISE missions involves analyzing infrared color trends to predict physical properties and ages of YB environments. Methods include applying summary statistics to histograms and color-color plots as well as SED fitting. Students in introductory astronomy classes contribute toward continued efforts refining photometric measurements of YBs while learning fundamental concepts in astronomy through a classroom-based participatory science experience, the PERYSCOPE project. We also describe an initiative that engaged seminaries, family groups, and interfaith communities in a wide variety of science projects on the Zooniverse platform. This initiative produced important guidance on attracting audiences that are underserved, underrepresented, or apprehensive about science.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the mass--spin diagram for classifying black holes and studying their formation pathways, providing an analogue to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time (i.e., Cosmic Accretion) or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.
#### New Insight from the James Webb Space Telescope on Variable Active Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 Variability detected in galaxies is usually attributed to their active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While all AGNs are intrinsically variable, the classic AGN unification model predicts that type~2 AGNs rarely vary because their engines are obstructed by dust tori. Previous UV-to-near-IR variability studies largely support this expectation. Here, we present a variability study by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that reveals a more subtle picture. Using NIRCam imaging data from three surveys over $\sim$140~arcmin$^2$ in the COSMOS field, we found 117 galaxies with $\geq 4$$\sigma$ variability in the F356W band across a $\sim$2-year baseline. Cross-matching with existing JWST spectroscopic data in this area, we identified five of them at $z=0.19$--3.69, which were all coincidentally observed by a NIRSpec program almost contemporaneously with the last imaging epoch. One additional variable was identified at $z=0.90$ using the archival Keck telescope data. These six objects form our spectroscopic subsample. Interestingly, two reside in close-pair environments, while two others form a close pair themselves. Most of their light curves can hardly be explained by nuclear transients, and AGN variability is a more plausible cause. However, among these six objects, (1) only one shows broad permitted lines ($\Delta v > 1000$~km~s$^{-1}$) indicative of a type~1 AGN; (2) two show narrow permitted lines consistent with type~2 AGNs, with another one likely type~2 based on the host galaxy properties; and (3) two others, which form a pair, show no emission lines. Our results add more challenges to the unification model.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary neutron stars (BNSs) are among the most interesting sources for multimessenger studies. A number of recently discovered BNSs in the Milky Way by radio telescopes have added new information to the parameter distribution of the Galactic BNSs. The scarce of BNS mergers during the O4 run of the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) suggests a BNS local merger rate six times lower than the previous constraint obtained by O1-O3 runs. With these new multimessenger observations, in this letter, we adopt the compact binary population synthesis model and Bayesian analysis to constrain the formation and evolution of BNSs, especially the common envelope (CE) evolution. We find that it is required: (1) a fraction ($f_{\rm HG}\sim0.8$) but not all of the Hertzsprung gap donors merged with their companions in the CE stage, in order to simultaneously explain the low BNS merger rate density and the existence of the short-orbital-period ($\lesssim 1$ day) Galactic BNSs, different from either all ($f_{\rm HG}=1$) or none ($f_{\rm HG}=0$) adopted in previous studies; (2) a large CE ejection efficiency $\alpha$ ($\sim 5$), in order to explain the existence of the long-orbital-period ($\gtrsim 10$ day) Galactic BNSs.

 - **Abstract**
 The angular and spectral features of neutrinos emitted from primordial black holes (PBHs) carry key imprints of the black hole's fundamental properties. This work investigates the directional emission of neutrinos from Kerr-Newman PBHs undergoing Hawking evaporation, accounting for the combined effects of spin, motion, and electric charge. Rotation induces anisotropic fluxes through axisymmetric geometry and spin-dependent greybody factors, while relativistic motion leads to pronounced Doppler beaming along the direction of travel. Electric charge modifies the thermodynamic evolution and suppresses the emission of like-charged particles, altering the overall spectrum and burst duration. The resulting neutrino flux exhibits rich angular structure, energy dependence, and time profiles that vary with PBH parameters. These directional signatures enhance the prospects for detection at current and future neutrino observatories, and offer new multi-messenger probes of PBH populations in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The polarized emission of astrophysical masers, especially OH and methanol lines, is an effective tool to study the magnetic field in high-mass star-forming regions. The magnetic field strength measurement via the Zeeman effect of OH maser emission is well established, but that of the methanol maser emission is still under debate because of its complex hyperfine structure. We aim to identify the dominating hyperfine transition of the Class II methanol maser emission by comparing the magnetic field strength measured with the excited OH maser emission and the Zeeman splitting of the methanol maser emission. We used quasi-simultaneous EVN observations of the two maser emissions at 6.035 GHz ex-OH and 6.668 GHz methanol toward two well-known high-mass young stellar objects: ON 1 and W75N. The observations were performed in full polarimetric mode and in phase-referencing mode to couple the maser features of the two maser emissions in each source. We detected linearly and circularly polarized emission in both maser transitions and HMYSOs. Specifically, we measured the magnetic field strength in twelve and five ex-OH maser features toward ON1 and W75N, respectively, and the Zeeman splitting of the methanol maser spectra in one and three maser features toward ON 1 and W75N, respectively. We determined that the two maser emissions likely probe the same magnetic field but at different densities. Indeed, a direct comparison of the magnetic field strength and the Zeeman splitting as measured with the ex-OH and methanol maser spots, respectively, provided values of the Zeeman splitting coefficient for the 6.7 GHz maser that do not match any of the table values present in the literature. We are not able to uniquely identify the dominating hyperfine transition; however, through density considerations, we can narrow the choice down to three hyperfine transitions: 3->4, 6->7A, and 7->8.
#### SN 2024hpj: a perspective on SN 2009ip-like events

 - **Abstract**
 Supernovae (SNe) IIn are terminal explosions of massive stars that are surrounded by a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). Among SNe IIn, a notable subset is the SNe 2009ip-like, which exhibit an initial, fainter peak attributed to stellar variability in the late evolutionary stages, followed by a brighter peak, interpreted as the SN explosion itself. We analyse the spectrophotometric evolution of SN 2024hpj, a SN IIn with signs of precursor activity. Comparing it with similar objects in the literature, we identify star-forming regions as their preferred environments, while a statistical analysis on the observed rate of SNe 2009ip-like indicates progenitor masses around 25 - 31 solar masses and lower. The diversity of spectrophotometric features within the sample suggests that variations in CSM mass and distribution influence the observed characteristics, indicating a shared progenitor scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the formation of stellar bars in 307 Milky Way-mass disc galaxies in the TNG50 cosmological simulation. Most bars form rapidly in dynamically cold discs shortly after the central stellar mass exceeds that of dark matter. In these cases, bar formation is consistent with secular instabilities driven by the disc's self-gravity, which organises stellar orbits into a coherent bar structure. However, around 25 per cent of barred galaxies are dark matter dominated at the time of bar formation, $t_{bar}$, and remain so thereafter. We trace the origin of these bars to tidal perturbations induced by passing satellites or mergers using a new metric, $S_{bar}$, quantifying the tidal field acting on the galaxy. At the time of bar formation, we find a negative correlation between $S_{bar}$ and the central stellar-to-dark matter mass fraction, indicating that more dark matter-dominated discs require stronger tides to trigger bar formation. These tidally induced bars are more likely to be transient than those that form secularly, although bar properties are otherwise similar. However, the host galaxies differ: secular bars arise in relatively compact discs, while tidal bars appear in extended discs whose properties resemble those of unbarred galaxies. Tidal perturbations can therefore induce bars in galaxies otherwise stable to secular formation, highlighting the dual role of the internal galactic structure and the external environment in bar formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The rate of stellar evolution can rarely be measured in real time. The fastest evolution (excluding event-driven evolution), where stars may evolve measurably over decades, is during the post-AGB phase. In this paper we provide direct evidence for such a case. A secular, linear, factor of ~2.5 increase is found in the strength of the [O III] lines relative to H-beta over an 130 year period in the young, well-known, low excitation planetary nebula IC 418. The increase is caused by the rising temperature of the central star. We use photo-ionization models to derive a model dependent heating rate for the central star in the range 15-42 K\/yr. These derived heating rates are very sensitive to the stellar mass, and yield a central-star mass of 0.560-0.583 solar masses. Initial-final mass relations based on the Miller-Bertolami models give a progenitor main-sequence mass of 1.25-1.55 solar masses. IC 418 is a carbon rich planetary nebula and its central star, HD 35914, has evolved from an AGB carbon star. This result shows that carbon star formation at solar metallicity extends to these low masses. This is lower than commonly assumed and suggests that post-AGB evolution may be slower than recent post-AGB models predict.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the third installment of the Alma Luminous Star (ALS) catalogue, aimed at creating the most comprehensive and clean sample of Galactic massive stars. This update extends the sample by adding approximately 2000 OB stars, incorporating astrometric and photometric data from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) alongside spectroscopic information from the Galactic O-Star Catalog based on recent ground-based spectroscopic surveys. Rigorous astrometric corrections are applied to Gaia DR3 parallaxes, proper motions, and photometry, ensuring accurate distance estimates through a Bayesian method suited to this stellar population's spatial distribution in the Milky Way. We perform some comparative analyses highlighting the improved distance accuracy over previous versions, underscore the importance of precise spectral classifications with competing catalogues, and identify areas for improvement in Gaia DR3 effective temperature and extinction estimates for massive stars. We also address the challenges of having robust definitions for these objects. In addition, we explore the catalogue's ability to trace Galactic features such as spiral arms, spurs and OB associations (with some insights on the nature of Gould's Belt). Finally, we discuss the potential for further expanding the sample with upcoming surveys. This effort marks a significant advancement in the creation of a reliable census of Galactic massive stars, contributing to our understanding of the Milky Way's structure and star formation history. This catalogue should serve as a valuable reference for the massive star community, supporting research on stellar interiors, winds, stellar feedback, and other processes that make OB stars key to the evolution of galaxies.
#### Estimating Initial Mass of Gaia-Enceladus Dwarf Galaxy with Chemical Evolution Model

 - **Abstract**
 This work investigates the initial mass and chemical evolution history of the Gaia-Enceladus dwarf galaxy. We combine spectroscopic data from APOGEE with astrometric data from Gaia DR3 to identify Gaia-Enceladus candidate stars via a machine-learning pipeline using t-SNE and HDBSCAN. By focusing on kinematic and chemical parameters, especially $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$, $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]}$, $\mathrm{[Al/Fe]}$, and $\mathrm{[Mn/Fe]}$, we uncover a population of metal-poor, high-eccentricity stars that align with literature criteria for Gaia-Enceladus debris. We then apply the \textit{OMEGA+} chemical evolution model, incorporating MCMC fitting of the observed abundance trends in the $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]\times[Fe/H]}$ plane. Our best-fitting model indicates a gas mass of $4.93_{-0.72}^{+0.32}\times10^9\,{M_{\odot}}$ for Gaia-Enceladus, placing it at the higher end of previously suggested mass ranges. The model scenario suggests a short star formation timescale, substantial outflows, and a rapid build-up of metals mainly driven by core-collapse supernovae, with a lesser contribution from Type~Ia supernovae. Comparison with observational data in other chemical planes (e.g., $\mathrm{[Mg/Mn]\times[Al/Fe]}$) supports this scenario, emphasizing a distinct evolution path relative to the Milky Way. Additionally, our results provide indirect evidence that star formation in Gaia-Enceladus likely ceased within the first 4 Gyr, consistent with earlier inferences of an early merger event. These findings highlight the power of chemical evolution modeling in reconstructing the origin and mass of ancient accreted systems. Overall, we show that Gaia-Enceladus, through a rapid star formation and strong outflows, contributed a significant fraction of the metal-poor stellar halo of the Milky Way.
