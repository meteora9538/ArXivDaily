 - **Abstract**
 In-space manufacturing is essential for achieving long-term planetary colonization, particularly on Mars, where material transport from Earth is both costly and logistically restrictive. Traditional subtractive manufacturing methods are highly equipment-, energy-, and material-intensive, making additive manufacturing (AM) a more practical and sustainable alternative for extraterrestrial production. Among various AM technologies, selective laser melting (SLM) stands out due to its exceptional versatility, precision, and capability to produce dense metallic parts with complex geometries. However, conventional SLM processes rely heavily on inert argon environments to prevent oxidation and ensure high-quality part formation, conditions that are difficult to reproduce on Mars. This study investigates the feasibility of using carbon dioxide (CO2), which makes up over 95% of the Martian atmosphere, as a potential substitute for argon in SLM. Single-track and two-dimensional 316L stainless steel specimens were fabricated under argon, CO2, and ambient air environments with a wide range of laser parameters to evaluate the influence of atmospheric composition on surface morphology, microstructural cohesion, and oxidation behavior. The results reveal that no single parameter controls the overall part quality; rather, a balance of parameters is essential to maintain thermal equilibrium during fabrication. Although parts produced in CO2 exhibited slightly inferior surface finish, cohesion, and oxidation resistance compared to argon, they performed significantly better than those fabricated in ambient air. These findings suggest that CO2-assisted SLM could enable sustainable in situ manufacturing on Mars and may also serve as a cost-effective alternative shielding gas for terrestrial applications.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary black holes (BBHs) exhibiting spin-induced orbital precession offer unique insight into compact-binary formation channels, cosmology, and tests of general relativity. We conduct a dedicated search for precessing BBHs in Advanced LIGO's third observing run (O3) using the harmonic decomposition method of precessing waveforms. We introduce a novel scheme to reduce the number of filters in a harmonic search. With our new approach, our template bank requires $5\times$ fewer filters compared to another proposed precessing search in the same region. We do not find any new significant events. Our new search method achieves up to $\sim 28\%$ improvement in sensitivity and up to $5\times$ lower computational costs compared to existing precessing search pipelines. Our method enables scalable, sensitive searches for precessing BBHs in future gravitational-wave observing runs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and the James Webb Space Telescope are transforming our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in the early Universe. By combining their capabilities, these observatories provide unprecedented insights into the gas, dust, and stars of high-redshift galaxies at spatially resolved scales, unveiling the complexities of their interstellar medium, kinematics, morphology, active galactic nuclei, and star formation activity. This review summarizes recent breakthroughs in the study of galaxies during the first billion years of cosmic history, highlighting key discoveries, open questions, and current limitations. We discuss how observations, theoretical models, and simulations are shaping our understanding of early galaxy evolution and identify promising directions for future research. While significant progress can be achieved through optimized use of existing facilities and collaborative efforts, further advances will require enhanced angular resolution and sensitivity, motivating upgrades to current instruments and the development of next-generation observatories.
#### Gasflows in Barred Galaxies with Big Orbital Loops-A Comparative Study of Two Hydrocodes

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04319

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04319

 - **Abstract**
 We study the flow of gas in a barred-galaxy model, in which a considerable part of the underlying stable periodic orbits have loops where, close to the ends of the bar, several orbital families coexist and chaos dominates. Such conditions are typically encountered in a zone between the 4:1 resonance and corotation. The purpose of our study is to understand the gaseous flow in the aforementioned environment and trace the morphology of the shocks that form. We use two conceptually different hydrodynamic schemes for our calculations, namely, the mesh-free Lagrangian SPH method and the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES. This allows us to compare responses by means of the two algorithms. We find that the big loops of the orbits, mainly belonging to the x1 stable periodic orbits, do not help the shock loci to approach corotation. They deviate away from the regions occupied by the loops, bypass them and form extensions at an angle with the straight-line shocks. Roughly at the distance from the center at which we start to observe the big loops, we find characteristic "tails" of dense gas streaming towards the straight-line shocks. The two codes give complementary information for understanding the hydrodynamics of the models.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the ionized gas kinematics of HII regions in the disk of NGC 7331 using integral field unit data collected with the Circumgalactic H$\alpha$ Spectrograph (CH$\alpha$S). NGC 7331 is a well-studied nearby galaxy with HII regions resolved by seeing-limited observations, making it ideally suited for this work. The galaxy disk features vigorous star formation, especially in the central ring of starburst activity. We present a catalog of 136 HII regions detected in the SIRTF Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) H$\alpha$ image. Using this refined catalog, we perform aperture photometry on the SINGS narrowband H$\alpha$ images of NGC 7331, extracting the H$\alpha$ luminosity L(H$\alpha$) of these regions. We present corresponding measurements of the average line-of-sight ionized gas velocity dispersion $\sigma$ in these HII regions with CH$\alpha$S. High-resolution velocity and dispersion maps of the galactic disk are produced from the CH$\alpha$S spectral imaging, selecting spaxels with high signal to noise in order to measure velocity dispersions as low as 12 km s$^{-1}$. Our measurements of the L(H$\alpha$), $\rm \Sigma_{SFR}$ and $\sigma$ in NGC 7331 are consistent with spatially resolved observations of HII regions in large surveys of nearby galaxies. We explore the L(H$\alpha$)$- \sigma$ relationship, identifying turbulent HII regions with nonthermal dispersions likely driven by stellar feedback. The dispersion is correlated with the star formation rate surface density, and using the relation $\rm \sigma \propto \epsilon \Sigma_{SFR}^{\alpha}$, HII regions in NGC 7331 are best fit by $\epsilon = 80$ , $\alpha =0.285$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the UV/X-ray joint spectral analyses of four Seyfert~1 galaxies (PG 0804+761, NGC 7469, SWIFT J1921.1-5842, and SWIFT J1835.0+3240) using the data acquired with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope and Soft X-ray Telescope onboard AstroSat. We model the intrinsic UV/X-ray continuum with the accretion disk, warm and hot Comptonization using the OPTXAGNF and FAGNSED models, where the disk seed photons are Comptonized in the warm and hot corona. The Eddington ratio of the four Seyferts ranges from 0.01 to 1. In the case of SWIFT J1835.0$+$3240, we infer a compact warm corona ($ R_{warm} - R_{hot} \lesssim 18 r_{g}$) while, PG 0804+761, NGC 7469, and SWIFT J1921.1-5842 may exhibit a larger warm Comptonizing region ($\gtrsim 32r_{g}$). We could constrain the spin parameter in PG 0804+761, $a^{\star} = 0.76_{-0.20}^{+0.08}$ (1$\sigma$ error), with the FAGNSED model. In SWIFT J1835.0+3240 and SWIFT J1921.1-5842, the UV/X-ray spectral variability may be driven by the thermal Comptonization of the disk seed photons in the hot corona. Furthermore, the observed spectral hardening with the decrease in disk temperature and accretion rate compared to earlier observations may indicate a state transition in SWIFT J1835.0+3240 from a high/soft to a low/hard state.
#### Investigating the High-energy Radiation Environment of Planets in Sun-like Binary Systems

 - **Abstract**
 Far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation is a driving source of photochemistry in planetary atmospheres. Proper interpretation of atmospheric observations requires a full understanding of the radiation environment that a planet is exposed to. Using the Suborbital Imaging Spectrograph for Transition-region Irradiance from Nearby Exoplanet host stars (SISTINE) rocket-borne spectrograph, we observed the Sun-like binary system $\alpha$ Centauri AB and captured the FUV spectrum of both stars simultaneously. Our spectra cover 980--1570 Å, providing the broadest FUV wavelength coverage taken in a single exposure and spanning several key stellar emission features which are important photochemical drivers. Combining the SISTINE spectrum with archival observations, model spectra, and a novel stellar activity model, we have created spectral energy distributions (SEDs) spanning 5 Å--1 mm for both $\alpha$ Centauri A and B. We use the SEDs to estimate the total high-energy flux (X-ray--UV) incident on a hypothetical exoplanet orbiting $\alpha$ Centauri A. Because the incident flux varies over time due to the orbit of the stellar companion and the activity level of each star, we use the VULCAN photochemical kinetics code to estimate atmospheric chemical abundances in the case of minimum and maximum flux exposure. Our results indicate that enhanced atmospheric mass loss due to stellar binarity will likely not be an issue for future exoplanet-hunting missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory when searching for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars.

 - **Abstract**
 On 26 September 2022, the NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft impacted Dimorphos, the secondary component of the binary asteroid (65803)~Didymos. This experiment tested the Kinetic Impactor technology for diverting dangerous asteroids. Due to the impact, the binary system's angular momentum has changed, resulting in a significant change in the orbital period of Dimorphos. Precise values of the pre- and post-impact orbital periods were derived from a large set of photometric light curves measured for the Didymos-Dimorphos system during six apparitions from 2003 to 2023. We used these data to detect a possible change in the rotation period of the primary as a consequence of the impact. We analyzed the binary system's light curves using the binary asteroid light curve decomposition method. We selected parts of the light curves covering orbital phases outside mutual events, which represent the primary rotational light curves. We applied the light curve inversion method to construct a convex shape model of Didymos and determine its rotation period before and after the impact. These two periods were treated as independent free parameters of the modeling. We found a value of 2.2603891 +/- 0.0000002 h for the pre-impact period and 2.260440 +/- 0.000008 h for the post-impact period. Their difference 0.18 +/- 0.03 s is small yet significant, indicating that the rotation of Didymos became slower after the DART impact. The most plausible physical explanation is Didymos's post-impact reshaping, making its shape more oblate.

 - **Abstract**
 When a stellar binary encounters a spinning black hole, interesting phenomena might result due to the mutual interaction between the binary spin, orbital angular momentum and the black hole spin. Here we consider such encounters between an intermediate mass spinning black hole and a close identical white dwarf binary system whose center of mass follows a parabolic trajectory. After studying a corresponding three-body problem in the point particle approximation, we perform a suite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics based numerical simulations of such scenarios. For this, we integrate the geodesic equations for the spinning black hole, while considering the hydrodynamics and the self and mutual gravitational interactions of the stars in a Newtonian approximation, an approach justified by the choice of parameters in the theory. We consider various initial configurations of the binary center of mass leading to equatorial and off-equatorial orbits, as also various initial inclinations between the binary's initial spin angular momentum and its initial orbital angular momentum. We find that the effects of black hole spin manifest clearly in the tidal dynamics of the binary components, while the observables of tidal encounters such as mass fallback rates are strongly dependent on the initial inclination angle. We show that the influence of the black hole spin emerges in distinct ways for different initial configurations of the binary's spin alignment. We establish that within the ambits of the Hills mechanism, in certain cases, the fallback rate may show a three-hump structure, due to interactions between tidal debris of the individual stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for the sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) using high-energy neutrinos represents a frontier in high-energy astrophysics. However, a critical bottleneck remains: the ability to rapidly survey the sizable sky areas defined by the localization uncertainties of neutrino detectors and to provide rapid spectroscopic classification of the multitude of optical transients found within them. By deploying a large field-of-view with high-multiplex Multi-Object Spectroscopy (MOS) on a large aperture telescope, one can instantaneously cover neutrino error circles, thus providing crucial spectroscopic classifications of potential counterparts discovered, for example, by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST) with unprecedented efficiency. Furthermore, simultaneous operation of a giant panoramic central Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) would allow for detailed kinematic and environmental characterization of primary candidates. This facility would unlock deep synergies between next-generation neutrino telescopes (IceCube-Gen2, KM3NeT) and gamma-ray observatories (CTAO), transforming unique multi-messenger alerts into a comprehensive physical understanding.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a long-standing problem in astrophysics. Recent JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of overmassive black holes at z>4-6, where the BH masses lie far above local scaling relations and not reproduced by current cosmological models. How such overmassive black holes form and rapidly grow within young galaxies has remained unclear. Here we present fully cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that, for the first time, self-consistently follow the birth, early growth, and emergent observable signatures of SMBHs in proto-cluster environments. We find that heavy seeds of order $10^6 M_\text{sun}$ naturally form, exceeding typical theoretical expectations by an order of magnitude. These seeds rapidly develop dense, optically thick disks whose strong electron scattering produces broad H$\alpha$ emission comparable to that seen in little red dots (LRDs). Sustained super-Eddington accretion then drives fast growth to $\sim 3 \times 10^7 ~M_\text{sun}$ by $z \sim 8$. These results provide a unified physical scenario in which LRDs correspond to a short-lived, enshrouded phase of heavy-seed formation, naturally evolving into the overmassive quasars detected by JWST and ultimately the progenitors of today's SMBHs.
#### Jet launching from the Kerr black hole magnetosphere: An electrogeodesic approach

 - **Abstract**
 The launch of relativistic jets of plasma on astrophysical to cosmological scales are observed in a variety of astrophysical sources, from active galactic nuclei to X-rays binaries. While these jets can be reproduced by the general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) and particle-in-cells (GRPIC) simulations of the dynamical Kerr magnetosphere, the development of analytic models to describe the physics of the jets has remained limited. A key challenge is to analytically describe the individual trajectories of accelerated charged particles which ultimately build up the jet and emit radiation. In this work, we provide a first simple but fully analytical model of jet launching from the Kerr magnetosphere based on the motion of charged particles. To that end, we use the integrability of electrogeodesic motion in the Kerr monopole magnetosphere to study the ejection of charged particles near the poles. This enables us to derive (i) a criterion for the rotation axis to constitute a stable latitunal equilibrium position, thereby representing an idealized jet, (ii) the expression for the magnetic frame-dragging effect, and (iii) the condition for an asymptotic observer to measure blueshifted particles emanating from the black hole surroundings. Our study reveals that particles can be accelerated only in a specific region whose maximal radius depends on the spin and magnetization of the black hole. Alongside these results, we provide a detailed review of the construction of test magnetospheres from (explicit and hidden) symmetries of the Kerr geometry and the condition for the separability of the electrogeodesic motion in a test magnetosphere, which serves as a basis for the model we study in this work.
