 We present the discovery of AT 2024wpp ("Whippet"), a fast and luminous 18cow-like transient. At a redshift of z=0.0868, revealed by Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectroscopy of its faint and diffuse star-forming host, it is the fourth-nearest example of its class to date. Rapid identification of the source in the Zwicky Transient Facility data stream permitted ultraviolet-through-optical observations to be obtained prior to peak, allowing the first determination of the peak bolometric luminosity (2x10^45 erg/s), maximum photospheric radius (10^15 cm), and total radiated energy (10^51 erg) of an 18cow-like object. We present results from a comprehensive multiwavelength observing campaign, including a far-UV spectrum from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope and deep imaging extending >100 days post-explosion from the Very Large Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, Very Large Array, and Atacama Large Millimetre Array. We interpret the observations under a model in which a powerful rapidly-accreting central engine blows a fast (~0.15c) wind into the surrounding medium and irradiates it with X-rays. The high Doppler velocities and intense ionization within this wind prevent any identifiable features from appearing in the ejecta or in the surrounding circumstellar material, even in the far-ultraviolet. Weak H and He signatures do emerge in the spectra after 35 days in the form of double-peaked narrow lines. Each peak is individually narrow (full width ~3000 km/s) but the two components are separated by ~6600 km/s, indicating stable structures of denser material, possibly representing streams of tidal ejecta or an ablated companion star.

 - **Abstract**
 It has long been thought that black hole accretion flows are driven by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, and there are now many general relativistic global simulations illustrating the dynamics of this process. However, many challenges must be overcome in order to predict observed spectra from luminous systems. Ensuring energy conservation, local thermal balance, and local ionization equilibrium, our post-processing method incorporates all the most relevant radiation mechanisms: relativistic Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung, and lines and edges for 30 elements and all their ions. Previous work with this method was restricted to black holes of $10 M_\odot$; here, for the first time, we extend it to $10^8 M_\odot$ and present results for two sub-Eddington accretion rates and black hole spin parameter 0.9. The spectral shape predicted for stellar-mass black holes matches the low-hard state for the lower accretion rate and the steep power law state for the higher accretion rate. For high black hole mass, both accretion rates yield power-law continua from $\sim 0.5 - 50$~keV whose X-ray slopes agree well with observations. For intermediate mass black holes, we find a soft X-ray excess created by inverse Compton scattering of low-energy photons produced in the thermal part of the disk; this mechanism may be relevant to the soft X-ray excess commonly seen in massive black holes. Thus, our results show that standard radiation physics applied to GRMHD simulation data can yield spectra reproducing a number of the observed properties of accreting black holes across the mass spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 We present integral field spectroscopy of the interacting galaxy system NGC 2207/IC 2163 obtained with the imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer SITELLE. Approximately 1000 HII region complexes are detected in both galaxies and analyzed using their strong optical emission lines. Their properties were studied via BPT diagrams and their luminosity function. We conducted a detailed study of the distribution of oxygen abundance across the system using a series of strong-line O/H indicators and calibrations. Both galaxies exhibit negative galactocentric abundance gradients with a slope -0.015 dex kpc$^{-1}$. There are marginal signs of discontinuities in the O/H gradients with some indicators while no significant azimuthal variations are seen. A shallower slope in the HII region luminosity function between the arm and inter-arm regions in IC 2163 is observed, supporting previous conclusion that the star formation process in this galaxy eyelids has been altered during the interaction. The kinematics of the ionised gas reveal disturbed velocity fields, AGN-like features in the nucleus of NGC 2207, and elevated velocity dispersion in turbulent or feedback-driven regions. To interpret these findings, we modeled the collision using the numerical algorithm GCD+. The simulation reproduces key features of the system and demonstrates how close passages drive enhanced star formation and localized chemical enrichment. Finally, two dwarf galaxies in the field are found to have very similar systemic velocities as their larger counterparts, and could well play a minor role in the global interaction based on their morphology and position.

 - **Abstract**
 There is growing evidence from gravitational-wave observations that some merging black holes are created from previous mergers. Using the prediction that these hierarchically-merged black holes have dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\chi \approx 0.69$, we identify a subpopulation in the gravitational-wave data consistent with a hierarchical-merger origin in dense star clusters. This subpopulation's primary mass distribution peaks at $16.7^{+3.1}_{-4.6},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, which is approximately twice as large as its secondary mass distribution's mode ($8.0^{+29.7}_{-2.3},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), and its spin tilt distribution is consistent with isotropy. Our inferred secondary mass distributions imply that isolated binary evolution may still be needed to explain the entirety of the $9\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak. Surprisingly, we find that the rate of hierarchical mergers may evolve more steeply with redshift than the rest of the population ($98.5\%$ credibility): the fraction of all binary black holes that are hierarchically formed at $z=0.1$ is $0.05^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$, compared to $0.17^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$ at $z=1$. This provides an explanation for the previously-discovered broadening of the effective spin distribution with redshift. Our results have implications for star cluster formation histories, as they suggest the potential existence of a high-redshift population of massive, compact clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Regardless of their initial spins, the merger of two roughly equal mass black holes (BHs) produces a remnant BH of dimensionless spin $0.69$. Such remnants can merge with other black holes in dense stellar environments and produce hierarchical mergers. Analyzing the latest catalog binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors, we identify a subpopulation with primary spins consistent with such hierarchical mergers. Consistent with astrophysical expectations for mergers of second generation BHs with first generation BHs, we find that this subpopulation has mass ratios below $0.59^{+0.18}_{-0.23}$. We also infer that $19$-$88\%$ of the BBH population below this mass ratio is consistent with belonging to the hierarchically-merged population. Our results offer a natural explanation for the narrowing of the effective inspiral spin distribution with mass ratio observed in other studies.
#### Characteristics of the High-frequency Humps in the Black hole X-ray Binary Swift J1727.8--1613

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed timing analysis of the two high-frequency humps observed in the power density spectrum of Swift J1727.8--1613 up to 100 keV, using data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT). Our analysis reveals that the characteristic frequencies of the humps increase with energy up to $\sim30$ keV, followed by a plateau at higher energies. The fractional rms amplitudes of the humps increase with energy, reaching approximately 15\% in the 50-100 keV band. The lag spectrum of the hump is characterized primarily by a soft lag that varies with energy. Our results suggest that the high-frequency humps originate from a corona close to the black hole. Additionally, by applying the relativistic precession model, we constrain the mass of Swift J1727.8--1613 to $2.84 < M / M_{\odot} < 120.01$ and the spin to $0.14 < a < 0.43$ from the full-energy band dataset, using triplets composed of a type-C quasi-periodic oscillation and two high-frequency humps. When considering only the high-energy bands with stable characteristic frequencies, we derive additional constraints of $2.84 < M/M_{\odot} < 13.98$ and $0.14 < a < 0.40$.

 - **Abstract**
 Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are thought to be primarily associated with binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The SGRB population can therefore be scrutinized to look for signatures of the delay time between the formation of the progenitor massive star binary and the eventual merger, which could produce an evolution of the cosmic rate density of such events whose shape departs from that of the cosmic star formation history (CSFH). To that purpose, we study a large sample of SGRBs within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, with a particular focus on the delay time distribution (DTD) of the population. Following previous studies, we model the DTD either as a power-law with a minimum time delay or as a log-normal function. We consider two models for the intrinsic SGRB luminosity distribution: an empirical luminosity function (ELF) with a doubly broken power-law shape, and one based on a quasi-universal structured jet (QUSJ) model. Regardless of the chosen parametrization, we find average time delays $10\lesssim \langle \tau_\mathrm{d}\mathrm\rangle/\mathrm{Myr}\lesssim 800$ and a minimum delay time $\tau_\mathrm{d,min}\lesssim 350\,\mathrm{Myr}$, in contrast with previous studies that found long delay times of few Gyr. We demonstrate that the cause of the longer inferred time delays in past studies most likely resides in an incorrect treatment of selection effects.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first comprehensive spectroscopic and deep photometric study of the globular cluster (GC) candidate Patchick~126. The spectroscopic analysis is based on high-resolution near-infrared data obtained with the IGRINS spectrograph, while the photometric analysis relies on HST observations from the Hubble Missing Globular Cluster Survey (MGCS). We derived abundances for $\alpha$-(O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), light-(C, N), odd-Z (Na, Al), iron-peak (Fe, Co, Cr, Ni, Mn, V), and s-process elements (Ce) for four red giant stars observed in the H and K bands. Our results yield a mean metallicity of $\langle\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\rangle = -0.30\pm0.03$, with no evidence of intrinsic variation, and an $\alpha$-enhancement of $\langle\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}\rangle =+0.19\pm0.02$, consistent with the trends of metal-rich Galactic GCs. We detect an intrinsic C-N anti-correlation, but no Na-O or Al-Mg anti-correlations, in agreement with expectations for low-mass, metal-rich clusters. From the HST photometry, we constructed deep CMDs extending $\sim 2-3$ magnitudes below the MSTO. This depth allowed us to provide the first robust age estimate for the cluster. Applying the methods developed within the CARMA project, we derive an age of $11.9^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$~Gyr. We obtain a photometric metallicity of [Fe/H]$=-0.28$, in agreement with the spectroscopic results. The colour excess we derived, E(B-V) = 1.08, confirms that Patchick~126 is a heavily reddened cluster, located at a heliocentric distance of 7.8 kpc. From the orbital parameters, including energy, vertical angular momentum, circularity, and maximum vertical height, we find that Patchick~126 closely follows a disc-like orbit. Taken together, these results confirm that Patchick 126 is an in situ, low-mass globular cluster of the Milky Way, exhibiting properties that lie at the boundary between old-OCs and GCs.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsars are the most numerous class of Galactic gamma-ray sources detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Young pulsars occasionally experience sudden timing discontinuities called glitches, characterized by rapid changes in rotational parameters, usually followed by a return to regular rotation. PSR J2021+4026 is unique among Fermi-LAT pulsars, exhibiting quasiperiodic switches between two states with varying spin-down rates approximately every 3-4 years, correlated with sudden changes in gamma-ray emission features. This study searched for gamma-ray emission variability in pulsars correlated with glitch occurrence. We introduced a novel approach to analyzing LAT gamma-ray pulsars through systematic examination of variability associated with spin-down rate changes. We tracked rotation and gamma-ray emission changes for seven promising glitches selected based on observed spin-down rate variations. Using 14 years of Fermi-LAT data, we conducted binned likelihood spectral analysis of data windows around selected glitch epochs. We improved best-fit parameter precision by incorporating likelihood weights calculated from diffuse background models, accounting for systematic error contributions. The phase-averaged flux and spectral parameters of analyzed pulsars showed no significant variation across investigated glitches. The 95% upper limits on relative flux change indicate the Vela pulsar flux is unchanging, with a 0.5% upper limit on relative change, making it promising for further searches. The connection between glitch dynamics and gamma-ray emission remains unclear, and PSR J2021+4026 remains unique in its gamma-ray variability properties. We conclude that comprehensive investigation of glitches is warranted to further unravel their underlying mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration transients of unknown origin, likely associated with compact astrophysical objects. We report evidence for a damped millisecond quasi-periodic structure in a non-repeat FRB~20190122C. The burst consists of eight closely spaced radio pulses separated by $\sim$1 ms, with pulse amplitudes exhibiting an exponential decay starting from the brightest component. Combined Gaussian fitting and time-series analysis reveal a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at $\sim$1 kHz. The observed QPO is consistent with damped magnetospheric oscillations. Assuming an Alfvén wave origin, we estimate a surface magnetic field of $\sim 10^{12}$ G and a characteristic spin period of $\sim$1 s, favoring a low-field magnetar or young neutron star scenario. The absence of frequency drift and the presence of exponential damping disfavor a merger-driven origin. These results suggest the first detection of an exponentially decaying QPO in any FRB, marking a rare detection of coherent oscillatory behavior in FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Understanding the optical properties of astrophysical ices is crucial for modeling dust continuum emission and radiative transfer in cold, dense interstellar environments. Molecular nitrogen (N$_2$), a major nitrogen reservoir in protoplanetary disks, plays a key role in nitrogen chemistry, yet the lack of direct terahertz (THz)--infrared (IR) optical constants for N$_2$ ice introduces uncertainties in radiative transfer models, snowline locations, and disk mass estimates. Aims. We present direct measurements of the optical properties of N$_2$ ice over a broad THz--IR spectral range using terahertz pulsed spectroscopy (TPS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and comparison with literature data. Methods. N$_2$ ice was grown at cryogenic temperatures by gas-phase deposition onto a cold silicon window. The THz complex refractive index was directly reconstructed from TPS data, while the IR response was derived from FTIR measurements using Kramers--Kronig relations. The optical response was parameterized with a Lorentz dielectric model and validated by DFT calculations. Results. The complex refractive index of N$_2$ ice is quantified from $\nu = 0.3$--$16$~THz ($\lambda = 1$~mm--$18.75~\mu$m). Resonant absorption peaks at $\nu_\mathrm{L} = 1.47$ and $2.13$~THz with damping constants $\gamma_\mathrm{L} = 0.03$ and $0.22$~THz are attributed to optically active phonons of the $\alpha$-N$_2$ crystal. Conclusions. We provide a complete set of the THz--IR optical constants for \ce{N2} ice by combining TPS and FTIR spectroscopy. Our results have implications for future observational and modeling studies of protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation.
#### Formation of multi-planetary systems via pebble accretion in externally photoevaporating discs in stellar clusters

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate how external photo-evaporation influences the formation, dynamical evolution and the resultant planetary architecture of multi-planet systems born in stellar clusters. We use a model of N-body simulations of multiple planet formation via pebble accretion coupled with a 1-D viscous disc subject to external photo-evaporation. We found that external photo-evaporation reduces the planet growth by reducing the pebble mass reservoir in discs containing multiple planetary embryos across a wide range of disc masses, and is particularly effective in suppressing planet growth in less initially massive discs (< 0.1 M$_{\odot}$). However, in more initially massive ($\geq$ 0.1 M$_{\oplus}$) discs planets lost due to planet-planet interactions dominate the outcome for final resultant total planet mass, masking the effects of external photo-evaporation in curbing the planet mass growth. In terms of the final resulting planetary architectures, the signature of external photo-evaporation is visible in less massive (< 0.1 M$_{\odot}$) discs, with fewer numbers and lower masses of planets surviving in discs irradiated with stronger external FUV radiation. External photo-evaporation also leaves a signature for the wide orbit (> 10 au) terrestrial planets (0.1 - 1 M$_{\oplus}$), with fewer planets populating this region for stronger FUV field. Finally, the 1st-order resonant pairs fraction decreases with stronger FUV radiation, although the resonant pairs occur rarely regardless of the FUV radiation environment, due to the small number of planets that survive gravitational encounters.
#### HI-bearing dark galaxies predictions from constrained Local Group simulations: how many and where to find them

 - **Abstract**
 Dark galaxies are small, DM-dominated halos whose gas remains in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium and has never formed stars. They are of particular interest because they represent a strong prediction of the LCDM model. As of today, only a handful of candidates have been observed, the most intriguing of which being Cloud-9. Using several state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations, we aim to predict the abundance of dark galaxies expected within our Local Group (LG), characterise their properties and provide guidance for their potential detection. We analyse LG simulations with constrained initial conditions, run with different codes, implementing different baryonic physics, feedback prescriptions, and employing two distinct values of SF density threshold, n_th=0.13 and 10 cm^-3, to select samples of dark and bright galaxies harboured in haloes of similar mass. We demonstrate that dark galaxies exist in such simulations, though their number is larger in simulations that use a higher, more realistic n_th. These galaxies, whose gas remains diffuse and never forms stars, predominantly inhabit less-concentrated, higher-spin DM halos than their luminous counterparts. Dark galaxies are typically found in low-density regions at the outskirts of the LG, and their evolution across z indicate that both the DM and gas densities in their surroundings were consistently lower than those found around bright galaxies, making them less susceptible to interactions, mergers, or gas inflows. We estimate that up to 8 dark galaxies should be detectable in HI emission within 2.5 Mpc of the LG, with the FAST telescope, accounting for its sky coverage and minimum M_HI and N_HI. Current hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies, combined with upcoming HI surveys, will offer a direct and powerful test of LCDM through their ability to predict and measure properties of dark galaxies within and beyond the LG.
#### Characterizing the physical and chemical properties of the Class I protostellar system Oph-IRS 44. Binarity, infalling streamers, and accretion shocks

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) In the low-mass star formation process, theoretical models predict that material from the infalling envelope could be shocked as it encounters the outer regions of the disk. Nevertheless, only a few protostars show evidence of these shocks at the disk-envelope interface, and the main formation path of shocked-related species is still unclear. We present new ALMA observations of IRS 44, a Class I source that has previously been associated with accretion shocks, taken at high angular resolution (0.1"). We target multiple molecular transitions of CO, H2CO, and simple sulfur-bearing species. In continuum emission, the binary nature of IRS 44 is observed for the first time at sub-millimeter wavelengths. Infalling signatures are seen for the CO line and the emission peaks at the edges of the continuum emission around IRS 44 B, the same region where bright SO and SO2 emission is seen. Weak CS and H2CO emission is observed, while OCS, H2S, and H2CS transitions are not detected. IRS 44 B seems to be more embedded than IRS 44 A, indicating a non-coeval formation scenario or the rejuvenation of source B due to late infall. CO emission is tracing the outflow component at large scales, infalling envelope material at intermediate scales, and two infalling streamer candidates are identified at disk scales. Infalling streamers might produce accretion shocks when they encounter the outer regions of the infalling-rotating envelope. These shocks heat the dust and release S-bearing species as well as promoting a lukewarm chemistry in the gas phase. With the majority of carbon locked in CO, there is little free C available to form CS and H2CS in the gas, leaving an oxygen-rich environment. The high column densities of SO and SO2 might be a consequence of two processes: direct thermal desorption from dust grains and gas-phase formation due to the availability of O and S.

 - **Abstract**
 High-density and high-Z crystals are a key element of most space-borne $\gamma$-ray telescopes operating at GeV energies (such as Fermi-LAT). The lattice structure is usually neglected in the development of a crystalline detector, although its effects on the energy deposit development should be taken into account, since the interactions of a high energy ($\sim$~GeV) photon or e$^\pm$ impinging along the axis of an oriented crystal are different than the ones observed in a fully isotropic medium. Specifically, if the angle between a photon (e$^\pm$) trajectory and the crystal axis is smaller than $\sim$ 0.1$^\circ$, a large enhancement of the pair production (bremsstrahlung) cross-section is observed. Consequently, a photon-induced shower inside an oriented crystal develops within a much more compact region than in an amorphous medium. Moreover, for photon energies above a few GeV and incidence angles up to several degrees, the pair-production cross-section exhibits a pronounced dependence on the angle between the crystal axis and the photon polarization vector. \\ In this work we show that these effects could be exploited to develop a novel class of light-weight pointing space-borne $\gamma$-ray telescopes, capable of achieving an improved sensitivity and resolution, thanks to a better shower containment in a smaller volume with respect to non-oriented crystalline detectors. We also show that an oriented tracker-converter system could be used to measure the polarization of a $\gamma$-ray source above few GeV, in a regime that remains unexplorable through any other detection technique. This novel detector concept could open new pathways in the study of the physics of extreme astrophysical environments and potentially improve the detector sensitivity for indirect Dark Matter searches in space.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new and archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of two strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) selected from the South Pole Telescope survey, SPT0418-47 $(z = 4.225)$ and SPT2147-50 $(z = 3.760)$. We study the [C II], CO(7-6), [C I](2-1), and, in SPT0418-47, $p$-H$_2$O emission, which along with the underlying continuum (rest-frame 160 $\mu$m and 380 $\mu$m) are routinely used as tracers of gas mass and/or star-formation rate (SFR). We perform a pixel-by-pixel analysis of both sources in the image plane to study the resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, finding generally good agreement between the slopes of the SFR versus gas mass surface density using the different tracers. Using lens modeling methods, we find that the dust emission is more compact than the line emission in both sources, with CO(7-6) and [C I](2-1) similar in extent and [C II] the most extended, reminiscent of recent findings of extended [C II] spatial distributions in galaxies at similar cosmic epochs. We develop the [C I](2-1) / CO(7-6) flux density ratio as an observable proxy for gas depletion timescale ($\tau_{\rm dep}$), which can be applied to large samples of DSFGs, in lieu of more detailed inferences of this timescale which require analysis of observations at multiple wavelengths. Furthermore, the extended [C II] emission in both sources, compared to the total continuum and line emission, suggests that [C II], used in recent years as a molecular gas mass and SFR tracer in high-$z$ galaxies, may not always be a suitable tracer of these physical quantities.

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar spin-orbit angles of Neptune-sized planets present a primordial yet puzzling view of the planetary formation epoch. The striking dichotomy of aligned and perpendicular orbital configurations are suggestive of obliquity excitation through secular resonance -- a process where the precession of a hot Neptune becomes locked onto a forcing frequency, and is slowly guided into a perpendicular state. Previous models of resonant capture have involved the presence of companion perturbers to the star-planet-disk system, but in most cases, such companions are not confirmed to be present. In this work, we present a mechanism for exciting Neptunes to polar orbits in systems without giant perturbers, where photo-evaporation is the self-contained mechanism. Photo-evaporation opens a gap in the protoplanetary disk at ~1 au, and the inner disk continues to viscously accrete onto the host star, precessing quickly due to the perturbation of the outer disk. As the inner disk shrinks, it precesses more slowly, and encounters a resonance with the J2 precession of the Neptune, quickly exciting it to a polar configuration. While likely not applicable to more massive planets which trigger back-reactions onto the disk, this mechanism reproduces the obliquities of small planets in multiple respects.

 Observing supernovae (SNe) in the early Universe (z > 3) provides a window into how both galaxies and individual stars have evolved over cosmic time, yet a detailed study of high-redshift stars and SNe has remained difficult due to their extreme distances and cosmological redshifting. To overcome the former, searches for gravitationally lensed sources allow for the discovery of magnified SNe that appear as multiple images - further providing the opportunity for efficient follow-up. Here we present the discovery of "SN Eos": a strongly lensed, multiply-imaged, SN II at a spectroscopic redshift of z = 5.133 +/- 0.001. SN Eos exploded in a Lyman-{\alpha} emitting galaxy when the Universe was only ~1 billion years old, shortly after it reionized and became transparent to ultraviolet radiation. A year prior to our discovery in JWST data, archival HST imaging of SN Eos reveals rest-frame far ultraviolet (~1,300Å) emission, indicative of shock breakout or interaction with circumstellar material in the first few (rest-frame) days after explosion. The JWST spectroscopy of SN Eos, now the farthest spectroscopically confirmed SN ever discovered, shows that SN Eos's progenitor star likely formed in a metal-poor environment (<= 0.1 Z_{\odot}), providing the first direct evidence of massive star formation in the metal-poor, early Universe. SN Eos would not have been detectable without the extreme lensing magnification of the system, highlighting the potential of such discoveries to eventually place constraints on the faint end of the cosmic star-formation rate density in the very early Universe.
#### GRB 180728A and SN 2018fip: the nearest high-energy cosmological gamma-ray burst with an associated supernova

 - **Abstract**
 The long GRB 180728A, at a redshift of $z = 0.1171$, stands out due to its high isotropic energy of $E_{\gamma,iso} \sim 2.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg, in contrast with most events at redshift $z<0.2$. We analyze the properties of GRB 180728A's prompt emission, afterglow, and associated supernova SN 2018fip, comparing them with other GRB-SN events. This study employs a dense photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of the afterglow and the SN up to 80 days after the burst, supported by image subtraction to remove the presence of a nearby bright star, and modelling of both the afterglow and the supernova. GRB 180728A lies on the $E_{p,i}-E_{\gamma,iso}$ plane occupied by classical collapsar events, and the prompt emission is one of the most energetic at $z < 0.2$ after GRB 030329 and GRB 221009A. The afterglow of GRB 180728A is less luminous than that of most long GRBs, showing a shallow early phase that steepens around 5 hours (0.2 days). The GRB exploded in an irregular, low-mass, blue, star-forming galaxy, typical of low-z collapsar events. Because of the relatively faint afterglow, the light curve bump of SN 2018fip dominates the optical emission already after $\sim$3 days and is one of the best sampled to date. The strong suppression below $\sim$ 4000 angstrom and a largely featureless continuum in the early 6--9 days spectra favor aspherical two-component ejecta with a high-velocity collimated component ($> 20,000 km s^{-1}$), dominant early-on, and a more massive, low-velocity component, which dominates at much later epochs. Our findings indicate that asymmetries need to be considered in order to better understand GRB-SNe. In any case, SN 2018fip shares many characteristics with typical GRB-SNe. Its kinetic energy is below the common range of $10^{52}-10^{53}$ erg and does not correlate with the high energy of the GRB, highlighting the diversity of the GRB-SN energy budget partition.

 - **Abstract**
 Common envelope evolution (CEE) is a crucial phase in binary stellar evolution. Current global three-dimensional simulations lack the resolution to capture the small-scale dynamics around the embedded companion, while local wind-tunnel simulations always approximate the companion's orbital motion as linear rather than as rotation around the center of mass. We investigate how rotation, accretion, and stratification influence small-scale gas dynamics, gravitational drag and lift forces, and the spin-up rate of the companion. We perform three-dimensional local hydrodynamic simulations of a $0.2\, M_\odot$ compact companion plunging into the envelope of a $2\, M_\odot$ red giant in a reference frame rotating at the companion's orbital angular velocity, using the Athena++ code. The presence of stratification generates an inward-directed force, partially opposed by a rotation-induced outward lift force. Both the resulting inward directed force and the drag force, strongly influenced by stratification, would affect the evolution of the binary separation. We propose revised semi-analytical prescriptions for both drag and lift forces. Without accretion and for sufficiently small gravitational softening radii, a quasi-hydrostatic bubble forms around the companion, while accretion prevents its formation and converts kinetic energy into heat that could contribute to the envelope ejection. Drag and lift forces are only marginally affected by accretion. The companion spin-up rate varies non-monotonically in time, first increasing and then decreasing as it plunges deeper into the envelope. These results motivate future magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate how accretion, rotation, and stratification affect magnetic amplification, and how magnetic fields, in turn, influence mass and angular momentum accretion rates, as well as the drag and lift force exerted on the companion.
