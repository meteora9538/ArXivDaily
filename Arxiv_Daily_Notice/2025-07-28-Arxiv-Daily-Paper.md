#### Search for binary companions around millisecond pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 It is believed that the radio pulsars rotating at spin periods of about 30 millisecond or even lower got such high spins through the transfer of angular momentum by accreting matter from their binary companions (or past companions) in the past. Around 35% of MSPs are known to be isolated, some of the which might actually be in binaries - either not timed very well to obtain the signature of the orbit or in extremely wide binaries that can be revealed only through very accurate timing, as in the case of PSR J1024-0719. This has motivated an exercise to identify probable candidates of companions of MSPs in the Galactic field. This exercise has even the potential of discovering optical emission from MSPs themselves. Discovery of any possible binary companion will be followed by motivated pulsar timing campaigns to confirm the binary nature and to constrain orbital parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The report presents a comprehensive set of five recommendations to reduce language barriers within the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Research Ecosystem, promoting greater inclusion of researchers who are speakers of English as an additional language. Recognizing that English linguistic hegemony in science limits participation and productivity, the document proposes multilingual presentation formats, academic writing training, a Virtual Writing Center, language support programs, and writing retreats. Each recommendation is grounded in both pedagogical theory and empirical evidence, with an emphasis on collaborative, socially embedded approaches to scientific writing. The proposed academic writing training integrates constructivist and socio-cultural perspectives, emphasizing genre awareness, rhetorical competence, and reflective practices. The Virtual Writing Center would serve as a permanent infrastructure offering personalized tutoring and peer review support, while the language support programs address ongoing needs through workshops, consultations, and access to language tools. Writing retreats provide immersive environments for focused work and mentorship. The recommendations also encourage ethical use of AI tools for translation and writing assistance, fostering digital literacy alongside linguistic proficiency. Collectively, these initiatives aim to transform language from a barrier into a resource, recognizing multilingualism as an asset in global research collaboration. Rather than offering a one-size-fits-all solution, the document advocates for adaptable, community-driven strategies that can evolve within the diverse institutional and disciplinary contexts of the Rubin Research Ecosystem. By implementing these practices, the Ecosystem could lead efforts to democratize scientific communication and foster a more equitable, multilingual research culture.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic high-velocity clouds (HVCs) are known to be complex, multiphase systems consisting of neutral and/or ionized gas moving at high velocities relative to the rotation of the disk. In this work, we investigate Milky Way-like galaxies from the TNG50 simulation to characterize the properties, morphology, and accretion rates of the warm and hot ionized material comoving with neutral HVCs visible in HI. We find that the ionized gas forms an envelope around the neutral material, and in most cases (73% of the HVCs) it is prolate in morphology. We also find that the ionized mass is ~6 times greater than the neutral mass, which leads to significantly more accretion possible from the ionized gas ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{ion}$) than the neutral gas ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{neut}$), consistent with estimates made from observations of our own Galaxy. We investigate the accretion rates from both phases of HVCs around 47 Milky Way-like galaxies and find that $\dot{M}_\mathrm{ion}$ scales with $\dot{M}_\mathrm{neut}$, and both scale with the star formation rate of the galaxy. Finally, we find that, on average, $\dot{M}_\mathrm{ion}$ could account for 81% of the galactic star formation rate (assuming the material can sufficiently cool and condense), while $\dot{M}_\mathrm{neut}$ can only balance 11%. Thus, the diffuse, ionized, high-velocity circumgalactic medium plays a defining role in the evolution and growth of galaxies at low redshift.
#### Mapping water ice with infrared broadband photometry

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar ices play a fundamental role in the physical and chemical evolution of molecular clouds and star-forming regions, yet their large-scale distribution and abundance remain challenging to map. In this work, I present the ice color excess method, which parametrizes the peak optical depth ($\tau_{3.0}^{\mathrm{max}}$) of the prominent 3$\mu$m absorption feature, which is predominantly caused by the presence of solid H$_2$O. The method builds on well-established near-infrared color excess techniques and uses widely available infrared broadband photometry. Through detailed evaluation of passband combinations and a comprehensive error analysis, I construct the ice color excess metric $\Lambda(W_1 - I_1)$. This parameter emerges as the optimal choice that minimizes systematic errors while leveraging high-quality, widely available photometry from Spitzer and WISE data archives. To calibrate the method, I compile from the literature a sample of stars located in the background of nearby molecular clouds, for which spectroscopically measured optical depths are available. The empirical calibration yields a remarkably tight correlation between $\tau_{3.0}^{\mathrm{max}}$ and $\Lambda(W_1 - I_1)$. This photometric technique opens a new avenue for tracing the icy component of the interstellar medium on Galactic scales, providing a powerful complement to spectroscopic surveys and enabling new insights into the environmental dependence of the formation and evolution of icy dust grains.
#### The z = 9.625 Cosmic Gems Galaxy was a "Compact Blue Monster" Propelled by Massive Star Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery of five massive stellar clusters at z=9.625 in the Cosmic Gems has raised the question about the formation mechanism of star clusters in the first half Gyr after the Big-Bang. We infer the total stellar mass in clusters by normalizing and integrating the stellar cluster mass function (SCMF, dn(M)/dM ~ (n$_0$) $M^\beta$), assuming three different slopes $\beta$ = -1.5, -2.0 and -2.5 and different lower-mass limits between $10^2$ and $10^5$ Msun. The total integrated cluster stellar mass is compared to the stellar mass inferred from the counter-image of the Cosmic Gems, which provides the best, modestly magnified ($\mu$ = 1.84$\pm$0.05) representation of the entire galaxy. The delensed stellar mass of the Cosmic Gems galaxy is estimated as 3.5$_{-1.8}^{+3.3}$ x$10^7$ Msun, with an effective radius of Reff = 103$_{-15}^{+13}$ parsec and a stellar surface mass density of $\Sigma$mass = 520$_{-225}^{+340}$ Msun pc$^{-2}$. Accounting for normalization uncertainties - including different lensing magnification scenarios for the arc - a modified SCMF, combined with a significantly high star cluster formation efficiency (approaching 100%), appears to be a necessary condition to explain the relatively short formation timescale of both the star clusters and the counter-image, without exceeding the galaxy's stellar mass. By extrapolating the physical properties at the peak of the burst we find that in its recent past (<~ 30 Myr) the Cosmic Gems galaxy has likely experienced a specific star formation rate (sSFR) exceeding 25 Gyr$^{-1}$ and luminosity approaching the ``blue monster'' regime (M$_{UV}$ < -20). Our study provides insights into the extreme clustered nature of star formation in early galaxies and shed light into the formation of bound star clusters that might survive to z = 0 as globular clusters, older than 13 Gyr.
#### Magellan Spectroscopy of AGNs in Low-mass Galaxies: Scaling Relations and a Triple-Peaked AGN

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we aim to further populate the low-mass regime of black hole (BH) scaling relations to better understand the formation and growth mechanisms of central supermassive BHs. We target six galaxies that have been previously identified as hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on optical spectroscopy from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey or the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with stellar masses reported to be M$_\star < 5 \times 10^9$ M$_\odot$. Using follow-up optical spectroscopy from the Magellan Echellette Spectrograph (MagE), we extract galaxy velocity dispersions ($\sigma_\star$) and estimate virial BH masses from broad H$\alpha$ emission. We find that the galaxies in our sample do not deviate significantly from either the M$_{BH}-\sigma_\star$ or M$_{BH}-$M$_{\star}$ scaling relations defined by higher mass galaxies. Additionally, we identify one galaxy with triple-peaked SII, NII, H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. This spectral shape is not shared by OIII and, in fact, the OIII line appears to have distinct kinematics from the other emission lines. Incorporating the spatial distribution of the various emission lines, we find that the galaxy spectrum is consistent with a prominent central AGN driving an outflow, surrounded by an extended ring/disk of gas predominantly ionized by shocks and/or star formation. This work has implications for the demographics of BHs in low-mass galaxies and the role of AGN feedback.
#### JWST Spectroscopic Confirmation of the Cosmic Gems Arc at z=9.625 -- Insights into the small scale structure of a post-burst system

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy of the Cosmic Gems arc, strongly magnified by the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0615$-$5746. Six-hour integration using NIRSpec prism spectroscopy (resolution $\rm R\simeq 30-300$), covering the spectral range $0.8-5.3~\mu m$, reveals a pronounced $\rm Ly\alpha$-continuum break at $\lambda \simeq 1.3~\mu m$, and weak optical $\rm H\beta$ and $\rm [OIII]\lambda4959$ emission lines at $z=9.625\pm0.002$, located in the reddest part of the spectrum ($\lambda > 5.1~\mu m$). No additional ultraviolet or optical emission lines are reliably detected. A weak Balmer break is measured alongside a very blue ultraviolet slope ($\beta \leq-2.5$, $\rm F_{\lambda} \sim \lambda^{\beta}$). Spectral fitting with $\tt Bagpipes$ suggests the Cosmic Gems galaxy is in a post-starburst phase, making it the highest-redshift system currently observed in a mini-quenched state. Spatially resolved spectroscopy at tens pc scales shows relatively uniform features across subcomponents of the arc. These findings align well with physical properties previously derived from JWST/NIRCam photometry of the stellar clusters, now corroborated by spectroscopic evidence. In particular, five observed star clusters exhibit ages of $\rm 7-30~Myr$. An updated lens model constrains the intrinsic sizes and masses of these clusters, confirming they are extremely compact and denser than typical star clusters in local star-forming galaxies. Additionally, four compact stellar systems consistent with star clusters ($\lesssim10$ pc) are identified along the extended tail of the arc. A sub-parsec line-emitting HII region straddling the critical line, lacking a NIRCam counterpart, is also serendipitously detected.

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of energetic long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are thought to arise from the collapse of massive stars, making them powerful tracers of star formation across cosmic time. Evidence for this origin comes from the presence of supernovae in the aftermath of the GRB event, whose properties in turn link back to those of the collapsing star. In principle, with GRBs we can study the properties of individual stars in the distant universe. Here, we present JWST/NIRCAM observations that detect both the host galaxy and likely supernova in the SVOM GRB 250314A with a spectroscopically measured redshift of z $\simeq$ 7.3, deep in the era of reionisation. The data are well described by a combination of faint blue host, similar to many z $\sim$ 7 galaxies, with a supernova of similar luminosity to the proto-type GRB supernova, SN 1998bw. Although larger galaxy contributions cannot be robustly excluded, given the evidence from the blue afterglow colours of low dust extinction, supernovae much brighter than SN 1998bw can be. These observations suggest that, despite disparate physical conditions, the star that created GRB 250314A was similar to GRB progenitors in the local universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present and analyze panchromatic (0.35-14 $\mu$m) spectroscopy of the Type II supernova 2023ixf, including near- and mid-infrared spectra obtained 33.6 days after explosion during the plateau-phase, with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This is the first in a series of papers examining the evolution of SN 2023ixf with JWST spanning the initial 1000 days after explosion, monitoring the formation and growth of molecules and dust in ejecta and surrounding environment. The JWST infrared spectra are overwhelmingly dominated by H lines, whose profiles reveal ejecta structures unseen in optical spectra. We characterize the nature of these structures, concluding that they likely result from a combination of ejecta geometry, viewing angle, and opacity effects. We find no evidence for the formation of dust precursor molecules such as carbon-monoxide (CO), nor do we observe an infrared excess attributable to dust. These observations imply that any future signatures of molecules or dust in SN 2023ixf will arise either from freshly synthesized material within the ejecta or circumstellar material at radii not yet heated by the supernova at this epoch.
#### Quadratic estimators for unwindowed power spectrum of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and its application to $P_{\rm gm}(k)$ estimation

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy-galaxy weak lensing provides a powerful means of measuring the average matter distribution around lens galaxies -- i.e., the galaxy bias relation. Properly accounting for the spin-2 nature of weak lensing distortions, we develop a quadratic estimator for measuring the $E$- and $B$-mode angular power spectra from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, correcting for survey window effects arising from, for example, survey geometry and bright star masks. The estimator can be implemented efficiently by adopting FFTs on pixelized maps of the lens galaxy distribution and source galaxy ellipticities, under the flat-sky approximation. Using simulated weak lensing fields and halo catalogs in the light-cone ray-tracing simulations, we show that the estimator can recover the underlying $E$-mode power spectrum, $C_{{\rm g}E}(\ell)$, to within a few percent in fractional error, while minimizing the leakage of $E$-mode into the $B$-mode power spectrum, in each multipole bin over the wide range of multipoles (up to $\ell \sim 3000$ studied in this paper). We then discuss that the estimator can be used to estimate the 3D galaxy-matter power spectrum, $P_{\rm gm}(k)$, by dividing lens galaxies into multiple redshift slices. We also derive an optimal weighting for each lens redshift slice in the shot noise-limited regime for the estimation of $P_{\rm gm}(k)$, which reduces the statistical errors by up to $\sim$20\% compared to the case without weighting.

 - **Abstract**
 The carbon monoxide (CO) spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) of galaxies contain a wealth of information about conditions in their cold interstellar gas. Here we use galaxy-scale observations of the three lowest energy CO lines to determine SLEDs and line ratios in a sample of 47 nearby, predominantly star forming galaxies. We find systematic trend of higher gas excitation with increasing star formation rate (SFR) and SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), with the range of variations being even larger than predicted by simulations. Power law fits of the CO line ratios as a function of SFR and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ provide a good description of the trends seen in our sample and also accurately predict values for a wide range of galaxy types compiled from the literature. Based on these fits, we provide prescriptions for estimating CO(1-0) luminosities and molecular gas masses using CO(3-2) or CO(2-1) in cases where CO(1-0) is not observed directly. We compare our observed SLEDs with molecular cloud models in order to examine how the physical properties of cold gas vary across the galaxy population. We find that gas conditions in star forming and starburst galaxies lie on a continuum with increasing gas density in more actively star forming systems.
#### The coherent satellite velocity field around the interacting spiral galaxy pair NGC5713/19: signature of two galaxy groups merging

 - **Abstract**
 The luminous spirals NGC5713 and NGC5719 form an interacting galaxy pair 94 kpc apart and are connected by a straight, elongated neutral hydrogen structure extending over 200 kpc. Their 14 velocity-confirmed satellite galaxies and the two hosts separate into two distinct subgroups in their line-of-sight velocities and on-sky distribution revealing a prominent coherent kinematic structure with a velocity amplitude of 67+-12 kms-1 . We test four scenarios to explain the observed velocity field: isotropic motions in a dark matter halo, a plane of satellites seen nearly face-on, and a kinematically mixed satellite system with a co-rotating edge-on plane and an isotropic component, and a merger of two small galaxy groups. Taking the geometry and dynamical state of the NGC5713/19 pair into account together with their positions and motions in the Bootes Strip the most consistent picture is the infall of two satellite systems that follow their host galaxies along a cosmic filament. We believe this is the first clear example of an equal-mass L* disk galaxy merger where a kinematically coherent satellite system is in the process of formation. These observations reinforce the importance of major mergers as a channel for producing co-rotating satellite systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The dispersion measure-redshift relation of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provides a valuable cosmological probe for constraining the Hubble constant, offering an independent measurement that could help resolve the ongoing Hubble tension. In this paper, we begin with a sample of 117 localized FRBs and use 95 of them to constrain $H_0$ to $71.28^{+1.90}_{-2.08}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ within the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The resulting statistical uncertainty is below 2.8\%, improving previous FRB-based measurements and highlighting the promise of larger future samples. Beyond statistical improvements, we note that different parameter choices have been adopted in previous studies and some results show discrepancies in $H_0$. To address this issue, we perform a systematic assessment of modeling uncertainties that can affect the inferred value of $H_0$, including Galactic electron density models, the contribution of the Galactic halo, outliers such as FRB~20190520B located in extreme environments, and the other parameter selections. We also discuss possible approaches to mitigate these sources of uncertainty, emphasizing both the challenges and prospects of using FRBs as reliable cosmological tools.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar Orbiter and the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) are two of the newest facilities available to the solar physics community. The first coordinated observations of the Sun by these two facilities occurred over the course of one week in October 2022. The returned data are open-access and will provide a valuable resource to researchers in the field. We provide an overview of the datasets collected by Solar Orbiter and DKIST through this coordination and discuss their scientific potential. Our aim is to demonstrate how these unique high-resolution coordinated observations, as well as similar observations obtained through subsequent campaigns, can help tackle important science questions in the field. Between 18 and 24 October 2022, Solar Orbiter and DKIST observed a decayed active region simultaneously. During this period, Solar Orbiter's separation angle with Earth decreased from 77° to 51°, enabling stereoscopic observations with DKIST. From Solar Orbiter, observations are provided by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI), Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI), and the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) instruments. Meanwhile, DKIST observed using the Cryogenic Near Infrared Spectropolarimeter (CryoNIRSP), the Visible Broadband Imager (VBI), and the Visible Spectropolarimeter (ViSP). The first coordinated Solar Orbiter and DKIST campaign was a success, collecting observations multiple times over the week. We focus on three specific topics as representative examples, namely, coronal loop physics, the formation and evolution of the small-scale active region brightenings, and coronal rain dynamics. These open-access observations, and others like them, should help the solar physics community tackle key questions in the field. Such stereoscopic coordinated observations open up a new era in the analysis of the solar atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 The upper region of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is populated by massive stars in a diversity of evolutionary stages, and the classification of these stars is often based on observed characteristics exclusively in the optical spectral range. The near-infrared regime provides useful complementary information that can help resolving ambiguities in stellar classification and add valuable information about circumstellar envelopes or late-type companions. We present new, near-infrared medium-resolution K-band spectra for a sample of six evolved massive stars, four in M31 and two in M33. The spectra are obtained with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS) at the Gemini North telescope. We detect CO band emission from the environment of two M31 objects, J004320.97+414039.6 and J004621.08+421308.2, which we classify as B[e] supergiants, with J004320.97+414039.6 being most likely in a post-red supergiant stage. Two objects have pure emission from the hydrogen Pfund series. Of these, we propose that J004415.00+420156.2 in M31 could also be a B[e] supergiant while J013410.93+303437.6 (Var 83) is a well-known luminous blue variable (LBV) in M33. The M31 star J004229.87+410551.8 has a featureless spectrum and its evolutionary stage remains inconclusive; it could be an LBV undergoing an S Dor cycle. The object J013242.26+302114.1 in M33 displays a pure absorption spectrum, including CO bands, consistent with its identification as a cool star. Radial velocity measurements of this red component, combined with modelling of the spectral energy distribution, suggest that J013242.26+302114.1 may be a binary system consisting of an LBV or B[e] supergiant primary and a red supergiant secondary. If confirmed, it would represent the first of its kind.

 - **Abstract**
 Tracing dense molecular gas, the fuel for star formation, is essential for the understanding of the evolution of molecular clouds and star formation processes. We compare the emission of HCN(1-0), HNC(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) with the emission of N2H+(1-0) at cloud-scales (125 pc) across the central 5x7 kpc of the Whirlpool galaxy, M51a, from "Surveying the Whirlpool galaxy at Arcseconds with NOEMA" (SWAN). We find that the integrated intensities of HCN, HNC and HCO+ are more steeply correlated with N2H+ emission compared to the bulk molecular gas tracer CO, and we find variations in this relation across the center, molecular ring, northern and southern disk of M51. Compared to HCN and HNC emission, the HCO+ emission follows the N2H+ emission more similarly across the environments and physical conditions such as surface densities of molecular gas, stellar mass, star-formation rate, dynamical equilibrium pressure and radius. Under the assumption that N2H+ is a fair tracer of dense gas at these scales, this makes HCO+ a more favorable dense gas tracer than HCN within the inner disk of M51. In all environments within our field of view, even when removing the central 2 kpc, HCN/CO, commonly used to trace average cloud density, is only weakly depending on molecular gas mass surface density. While ratios of other dense gas lines to CO show a steeper dependency on the surface density of molecular gas, it is still shallow in comparison to other nearby star-forming disk galaxies. The reasons might be physical conditions in M51 that are different from other normal star-forming galaxies. Increased ionization rates, increased dynamical equilibrium pressure in the central few kpc and the impact of the dwarf companion galaxy NGC 5195 are proposed mechanisms that might enhance HCN and HNC emission over HCO+ and N2H+ emission at larger-scale environments and cloud scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Utilizing high-cadence and long-term optical photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS ), we conducted a time-resolved timing analysis of the Intermediate Polar, V709 Cas. Our analysis reveals key characteristics of this system: an orbital period of 5.3329 $\pm$ 0.0002 h, a spin period of 312.7478 $\pm$ 0.0002 s, and a beat period of 317.9267 $\pm$ 0.0002 s. These periods represent a significant refinement over the results of previous studies. These analyses demonstrate that V709 Cas is primarily a disc-overflow accretor, with accretion predominantly occurring via a disc. However, the analysis also reveals epochs where stream-fed accretion is a dominant accretion process. Time-resolved analysis of 20 s short cadence data obtained from sectors 57 and 58 reveals the presence of distinct first harmonics of the spin and beat frequencies. This finding indicates the presence of double peak spin modulation, a characteristic signature of two-pole accretion onto the white dwarf.

 - **Abstract**
 Dusty star-forming galaxies have long been suspected to serve as the missing evolutionary bridge between the star-forming and quiescent phases of massive galaxy evolution. With the combined power of JWST and ALMA, it is now possible to use high resolution imaging in rest-optical, rest near-infrared (NIR), and rest-submm wavelengths to study the multi-wavelength morphologies tracing both the stellar populations and dust within this key phase. We present the joint analysis of JWST/NIRCam imaging in GOODS-S and mm dust emission traced by ALMA for a sample of 33 galaxies at $z$=1.5 to $z$=5.5 selected from the 1.1mm GOODS-ALMA 2.0 survey, and compare the morphologies of this population to mass and redshift selected samples of field star-forming and quiescent galaxies. The 1.1mm-selected sample are morphologically distinct from other similarly massive star-forming galaxies; we find a steeper size-wavelength gradient from 1.5-4.4$\mu$m, with a more dramatic decrease in size towards longer wavelengths. While the rest-NIR surface brightness profiles of the 1.1mm-selected galaxies are brighter in the inner regions relative to the field star-forming population, they are remarkably similar to the quiescent population. These morphological differences could suggest that dusty star-forming galaxies, unlike more typical star-forming galaxies, have already built up stellar mass in a severely dust-obscured core, leading to extended and clumpy morphologies at rest-optical wavelengths and more compact emission in the rest-NIR that is co-spatial with dust. If the bulge is already established, we speculate that mm-selected galaxies may imminently evolve to join their quiescent descendants.

 - **Abstract**
 The ionization fraction ($f_\mathrm{e}=n_\mathrm{e}/n_\mathrm{H}$) is a crucial parameter of interstellar gas, yet estimating it requires deep knowledge of molecular gas chemistry and observations of specific lines, such as those from isotopologs like HCO$^+$ and N$_2$H$^+$, which are detectable only in dense cores. Previous challenges in constraining $f_\mathrm{e}$ over large areas stemmed from the limitations of observational tracers and chemical models. Recent models have identified molecular line ratios that can trace $f_\mathrm{e}$ in different environments within molecular clouds. In this study, we analyze various molecular lines in the 3-4 mm range to derive the ionization fraction across the Orion B giant molecular cloud. We focus on dense and translucent gas, exploring variations with gas density ($n$) and the far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field ($G_0$). Our findings show that the ionization fraction ranges from $10^{-5.5}$ to $10^{-4}$ in translucent gas and $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-6}$ in dense gas. Notably, $f_\mathrm{e}$ is sensitive to $G_0$ in dense, UV-illuminated regions, decreasing with increasing volume density ($f_\mathrm{e} \propto n^{-0.227}$ for dense and $f_\mathrm{e} \propto n^{-0.3}$ for translucent gas) and increasing with $G_0$. In translucent gas, differing line ratios yield consistent fe values, indicating the importance of electron excitation of HCN and HNC. For dense gas, we recommend using the CN(1-0)/N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) ratio for upper limits on fe and C$^{18}$O(1-0)/HCO$^+$(1-0) for lower limits. In translucent environments, CCH(1-0)/HNC(1-0) effectively traces $f_\mathrm{e}$. The higher fe values in translucent gas align with the C$^+$/CI/CO transition, while values in dense gas are adequate for coupling with the magnetic field.
