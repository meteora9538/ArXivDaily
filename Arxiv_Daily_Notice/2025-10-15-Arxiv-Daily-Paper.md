 - **Abstract**
 Rest-frame optical observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a population of massive galaxies, exceeding $10^{10}$ solar masses, present less than a billion years after the Big Bang. The large stellar masses of these galaxies require an efficient conversion of baryons into stars, which may exceed theoretical expectations. However, the formation process of massive galaxies so early in the Universe's history is perplexing, as observations provide limited information to constrain their evolutionary pathways. Here, we present multi-wavelength observations of a galaxy complex consisting of at least five galaxies within a $\sim10\,{\rm kpc}$ region, referred to as the \quintet, using JWST and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This system, located in the core of a galaxy protocluster at approximately 650 million years after the Big Bang, reveals the detailed physical processes involved in the formation of massive galaxies. These processes include a dynamic cycles of merger induced gas stripping, leading the temporal termination of star formation, and recycling of the stripped gas, with subsequent enhancement of star formation in other galaxies of the system, which is expected to evolve into massive galaxies that host more than $10^{10}$ solar masses of stars. The new observations represent the first comprehensive evidence of a massive galaxy formation through gas-rich, multiple-galaxy mergers induced by a dense protocluster environment in the $650\,{\rm Myrs}$ after the Big Bang. Our results suggest that the protocluster core is indeed one of the main drivers of efficient galaxy formation and rapid evolution in the early Universe, as predicted by theoretical studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Blue Jay survey, a Cycle-1 JWST program aimed at studying the stellar and gas content of galaxies at Cosmic Noon. The survey consists of deep spectroscopy for 153 targets observed over two pointings in the COSMOS field using the NIRSpec micro-shutter assembly (MSA). We employ the three medium-resolution gratings G140M, G235M, and G395M, with exposure times of 13 hours, 3.2 hours, and 1.6 hours, respectively. We thus obtain full coverage of the 1-5 micron range, corresponding to the entire rest-frame optical wavelength range. The sample is carefully selected to provide a census of galaxies over the redshift range 1.7 < z < 3.5 above a redshift-dependent minimum stellar mass that ranges from 10^8.7 Msun to 10^9.3 this http URL Blue Jay sample is representative of the entire galaxy population at these redshifts, without strong biases in color, star formation rate, or other properties. The sizes of massive galaxies at these redshifts are comparable to the NIRSpec shutters, which requires custom strategies for designing and reducing the observations. Since the standard A-B nod subtraction leads to flux self-subtraction, we construct a master background from empty shutters and subtract it from each of the science spectra. This, in turn, allows for the use of shorter slitlets consisting of only two shutters per galaxy instead of the usual three, with a substantial increase in the multiplexing of the NIRSpec MSA. We measure multi-band photometry using archival JWST and HST observations in two different ways: in a large elliptical aperture encompassing the entire source and from the exact area in the sky where the NIRSpec 1D spectrum is extracted. This enables self-consistent fits of spectroscopic and photometric data. The Blue Jay dataset, which we publicly release, represents the ideal sample for studying the stellar populations, neutral gas, and ionized gas in Cosmic Noon galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the PHANGS-MUSE/HST-Halpha nebulae catalogue, comprising 5177 spatially resolved nebulae across 19 nearby star-forming galaxies (< 20 Mpc), based on high-resolution Halpha imaging from HST, homogenised to a fixed 10 pc resolution and sensitivity. Combined with MUSE spectroscopy, this enables robust classification of 4882 H II regions and separation of planetary nebulae and supernova remnants. Electron densities for 2544 H II regions are derived using [S II] diagnostics, and nebular sizes measured via circularised radii and second moments yield a median of 20 pc, extending to sub-parsec scales. A structural complexity score traces substructure, showing that about a third of regions are H II complexes, with a higher fraction in galaxy centres. A luminosity-size relation calibrated from the HST sample is applied to 30,790 MUSE nebulae, recovering sizes down to 1 pc. Observed sizes exceed classical Stromgren radii, implying typical volume filling factors of 0.22. We associate 3349 H II regions with stellar populations from PHANGS-HST, finding median ages of 3 Myr and masses of 4-5 log(Msun). The dataset provides a detailed, spatially resolved link between nebular structure and ionising sources, serving as a benchmark for future studies of feedback, diffuse ionised gas, and star formation regulation in the interstellar medium. The full catalogue is made publicly available in machine-readable format.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the dark matter (DM) halo environment in which galaxies that host active galactic nuclei (AGN) reside is a window into the nature of supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion. We apply halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling tools to interpret the angular cross-correlation functions between $1.5\times10^6$ luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and our $\sim28,500$ Hyper Suprime-Cam + Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer-selected (and $L_{6 \mu m}$-limited) AGN to infer the halo properties of distinct quasar samples at physical scales $s>0.1\,{\rm Mpc}$, for $z\in0.7-1.0$. We find that Type I (unobscured) and Type II (obscured) AGN cluster differently, both on small and large physical scales. The derived HODs imply that Type I AGN reside, on average, in substantially ($\sim3\times$) more massive halos ($M_h \sim 10^{13.4} M_\odot$) than Type II AGN ($M_h \sim 10^{12.9} M_\odot$) at $>5\sigma$ significance. While Type II AGN show one-halo correlations similar to that of galaxies of their average halo mass, the Type I AGN intra-halo clustering signal is significantly shallower. We interpret this observation with HOD methods and find Type I AGN are significantly less likely ($f_{sat}\sim0.05^{+1}_{-0.05}\%$) to be found in satellite galaxies than Type II AGN. We find reddened + obscured AGN to have typical satellite fractions for their inferred average halo mass ($\sim10^{13} M_\odot$), with $f_{sat} \sim 20^{+10}_{-5}\%$. Taken together, these results pose a significant challenge to the strict unified AGN morphological model, and instead suggest that a quasar's spectral class is strongly correlated with its host galaxy's dark matter halo environment. These intriguing results have provided a more complex picture of the SMBH -- DM halo connection, and motivate future analyses of the intrinsic galaxy and accretion properties of AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanetary systems hosting multiple low-mass planets are thought to have experienced dynamical instability, during which planet-planet collisions and mergers occur; these collisions can impart substantial amount of angular momentum to the merger remnants, changing the obliquities of the resulting planets significantly. In this work, we carry out a series of $N$-body experiments to investigate the spin magnitude $(|\vec{S}|)$ and obliquity $(\theta_{\rm SL})$ distributions of low-mass exoplanets that have gone through planetary collisions. In our fiducial super-Earth (with $m=3M_{\oplus}$, $R=1.3R_{\oplus}$) and mini-Neptune systems (with $m=9M_{\oplus}$, $R=2.5R_{\oplus}$), the collision products follow a nearly uniform distribution in $\cos{\theta_{\rm SL}}$ and the spin-magnitude distribution is approximately linear in $|\vec{S}|$. Parameter studies and theoretical analysis show that increasing planetary radii or masses, or decreasing the initial planet-planet mutual inclinations, tend to polarize the obliquity distribution toward alignment or anti-alignment (i.e., excess probability near $\cos{\theta_{\rm SL}}=\pm1$). Experiments with initially two-planet and three-planet systems produce qualitatively similar outcomes, suggesting that the trends in this study may generalize to systems with higher planetary multiplicities.

 - **Abstract**
 Observed rotation curves of dwarf galaxies exhibit significant diversity at fixed halo mass, challenging galaxy formation within the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. Previous cosmological galaxy formation simulations with baryonic physics fail to reproduce the full diversity of rotation curves, suggesting either that there is a flaw in baryonic feedback models, or that an alternative to CDM must be invoked. In this work, we use the Marvelous Massive Dwarf zoom-in simulations, a suite of high-resolution dwarf simulations with $M_{200}~\sim 10^{10}-10^{11}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ and $M_{*}\sim 10^{7}-10^{9}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$, designed to target the mass range where galaxy rotation curve diversity is maximized, i.e., between $V_{\rm max} \sim 70-100~ {\rm km/s}$. We add to this a set of low-mass galaxies from the Marvel Dwarf Zoom Volumes to extend the galaxy mass range to lower values. Our fiducial star formation and feedback models produce simulated dwarfs with a broader range of rotation curve shapes, similar to observations. These are the first simulations that can both create dark matter cores via baryonic feedback, reproducing the slower rising rotation curves, while also allowing for compact galaxies and steeply rising rotation curves. Our simulated dwarfs also reproduce the observed size$-M_*$ relation, including scatter, producing both extended and compact dwarfs for the first time in simulated field dwarfs. We explore star formation and feedback models and conclude that previous simulations may have had feedback that was too strong to produce compact dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper is dedicated to the study of the luminous blue variable (LBV) Var 2 in the galaxy M33, which is currently in a "dormant" state and is observed as an Of/late-WN star. We had calculated self-consistent hydrodynamic non-LTE models of the extended atmosphere, taking into account the balance of radial forces in the wind of the star. This allowed us to obtain reliable estimates of the fundamental parameters of Var 2. The derived luminosity ($L=6.5\times10^{5}\,L_\odot$), current mass ($M_* \approx23\,M_\odot$) and hydrogen abundance on the surface (${\rm X}_{\rm H}\approx43\%$) correspond well to a star with the initial mass $M_{\rm init}\approx50\,M_\odot$ and age $t_{\rm age}\approx5.0\times10^6\,$years that is evolving from lower temperatures towards the Wolf-Rayet stars. A study of dynamic properties of the wind showed that the shape of the wind velocity profile of the Var 2 is close to the one of OB supergiants. In contrast, for the obtained mass loss rate $\dot{M}=2.1\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$, the ratio of the wind momentum to the luminosity of Var 2 is in good agreement with the values found for late-WN stars. At the same time, Var 2 has a lower terminal wind velocity $v_\infty\approx230\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$ compared to typical early-type supergiants or late-WN stars. Given the obtained age estimates, Var 2 could potentially have been ejected from the cluster associated with the nearest large star-forming region located at a distance of $\sim100\,$pc. However, statistical analysis of the projected distribution of stars in the vicinity of Var 2 suggests that this LBV could have formed in a local low-populated group.

 - **Abstract**
 The attracting properties of gravity enable matter present in cores to collapse into stars with seven orders of magnitude change in space and time making modelling of star formation a challenging multi-scale process. To circumvent this scale problem stars are replaced by a sub-grid sink particle at a much larger scale. Sink particles are created above a threshold density and acquire mass and momentum through accretion. In models where binary star systems form and migrate to separations of a few cells, the accretion flow is unresolved and the relative accretion rate to the sink particles may become inaccurate. We introduce a new recipe for accretion onto binary sink particles that have overlapping accretion regions and implement an algorithm to track the angular momentum of sink particles as a proxy for the stellar spin. Our preferential binary accretion recipe uses a virtual binary sink particle for the purpose of accretion and redistribute the accreted mass onto the sink particles according to results from models investigating binary accretion in detail. This solves problems common to current algorithms in many codes: (i) accretion is not suppressed due to large velocity differences between gas and stars, when that velocity is only internal to the binary system, (ii) the accretion rates are smoother for the unresolved close binaries in eccentric orbits, and (iii) non-physical suppression of accretion onto the secondary sink particle when the primary dominates the potential is eliminated. We test our implementation by comparing simulations at increasing resolution until the binaries are resolved. While not perfect, it mitigates undesired properties of current algorithms and in particularly for global models of starforming regions. It may also be applied to other unresolved accreting binaries, such as compact objects in clusters and binary supermassive black holes in cosmological models.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of wide, eccentric Gaia neutron stars (NSs) in binaries with still evolving (likely main sequence) companions offers a new probe of mass transfer and pulsar recycling beyond the compact-binary regime. We model their origins and fates using population synthesis with POSYDON and detailed binary evolution with MESA, contrasting two limiting prescriptions at Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF): enforced circularization versus explicitly eccentric mass transfer. Our MESA setups include updated treatments of eccentric, non-conservative transfer, magnetic-braking torques for cool stars, and neutron-star spin evolution with accretion and dipole spindown. Under optimistic assumptions, isolated evolution yields Gaia-like systems at only <1.5% relative rates of NS-evolving companion binaries, yet absolute numbers remain consistent with detections for continuous star formation. Synthetic populations indicate that many canonical millisecond pulsar-white dwarf (WD) binaries arise from unstable mass transfer and common envelope recycling, whereas Gaia systems typically avoid common envelope and only undergo stable mass transfer. In the case of capping accretion onto the NS at the Eddington rate, circular RLOF keeps the donor's mass-loss rate hovering around the Eddington limit and sustained over long timescales. Eccentric mass transfer instead produces briefer bursty signatures where the donor's mass-loss rate can climb up to a thousand times higher than in the circular case. The eccentric channel then leaves wide, eccentric NS-helium WD binaries with only mild recycling, whereas the circular channel yields long-lived transfer, circular NS-WD binaries (helium or carbon-oxygen core), and fully recycled millisecond pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars (>8 $M_{\odot}$) often undergo intense mass loss through winds or eruptive events in the final stages of their evolution, leading to the formation of a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). This material, expelled months to years before core collapse, shapes the pre-explosion environment and influences the early supernova (SN) emission. In particular, the interaction of the SN ejecta with the dense CSM can power an extended emission into the UV/optical bands, as seen in a growing fraction of type II SN. Recent events such as SN 2023ixf and SN 2024ggi confirm the relevance of dense environments and highlight the value of UV observations. Moreover, Fast Blue Optical Transients (FBOTs) may represent extreme cases of this interaction, possibly linked to more compact/massive CSM. In this work, we model the SN-CSM shock interaction in order to (i) estimate the maximum detection horizons and expected rates for future UV missions like ULTRASAT, and (ii) to estimate the intensity and expected rate of potential neutrino signals detectable by IceCube and KM3NeT. We then discuss the prospects for multi-messenger observations of such events in the near future.
#### PLATOSpec: a precise spectrograph in support of space missions

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming space missions that will characterize exoplanets, such as PLATO and Ariel, will collect huge amounts of data that will need to be complemented with ground-based observations. The aim of the PLATOSpec project is to perform science with an echelle spectrograph capable of measuring precise radial velocities. The main focus of the spectrograph will be to perform the initial screening and validation of exoplanetary candidates, in addition to study stellar variability. It will be possible to determine the physical properties of large exoplanets. The PLATOSpec blue-sensitive spectrograph, with a spectral range of 380 to 700\,nm and a resolving power of R=70,000, is installed on the 1.5-m telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory in Chile. Initial results show that the radial-velocity limit given by the wavelength calibration is about 2-3 m/s. Tests on bright F-K main-sequence standard stars reveal a scatter of about 5 m/s over a few hours. The scatter over a few months is slightly higher. We demonstrate the capabilities of PLATOSpec on the mass determination of WASP-79 b and the spin-orbit alignment of WASP-62\,b via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. We show its possible usage on variable star research as demonstrated on the false-positive exoplanetary candidate TIC 238060327, which is proven a binary star. Investigation of line-profile variations of the roAp star alpha Cir shows that PLATOSpec can also be used for the surface mapping. Finally, we present new results on the active star UY Pic in the PLATO southern field. Our results show that PLATOSpec is a versatile spectrograph with great precision.

 - **Abstract**
 The center of the Milky Way is a unique environment of great astrophysical interest, but its extreme crowding and extinction make it difficult to study. The GALACTICNUCLEUS survey, a high-angular-resolution near-infrared imaging program, was designed to overcome these challenges. We present the methodology and first results of its second data release, which includes major improvements in reduction, calibration, and analysis, providing deeper photometry, improved astrometry, and high-precision proper motions across the Nuclear Stellar Disk. Observations were obtained with VLT/HAWK-I in two epochs separated by seven years, using speckle holography and a ground-layer adaptive optics system. Proper motions were derived both relative, by aligning epochs within the survey, and absolute, by tying to the Gaia reference frame. The new release achieves photometry about one magnitude deeper and astrometry about ten times more precise than the first release. Proper motions reach an accuracy of about 0.5 mas/yr relative to Gaia. In the Arches field, our clustering analysis recovers the cluster with mean velocities consistent with HST-based results. The second data release of the GALACTICNUCLEUS survey provides the most precise ground-based proper motion catalogs of the Galactic Center to date, enabling studies of the Nuclear Stellar Disk, young star kinematics, and new stellar cluster detections.

 - **Abstract**
 Bow shocks generated from the interaction of winds from massive runaway stars with the interstellar medium have been shown to be prominent particle accelerators through recent $\gamma$-ray and radio synchrotron observations. Here, we study particle acceleration from bow shocks by conducting 3D ideal cosmic ray magnetohydrodynamic simulations in the advection-diffusion limit. We use the Eulerian grid-based code FLASH, where stellar winds are injected through tabulated wind velocities and mass loss rates. We implement a gradient-based shock detection algorithm to resolve the shocked regions where the CRs are injected dynamically. Simulations are performed for different values of the CR diffusion coefficient and star velocities within an ISM-like environment up to 180 kyr to showcase the impact of dynamical CR injection on the early evolution of the wind-driven bow shock. With a simplified spectral model in post-processing, we calculate the expected upper limits of $\gamma$-ray and synchrotron emission and compare with those from current observations. We observe that variations of CR diffusion rates can strongly dictate the morphology of the bow shock and the overall $\gamma$-ray and radio synchrotron luminosity due to the balance between the CR injection efficiency and diffusion. Our results yield qualitatively comparable results with current observations, primarily attributed to the high-energy protons and electrons contributing to non-thermal emission from efficient acceleration at the forward shock through the approximations and assumptions in the injection algorithm. We conclude that CR acceleration, with varying CR diffusion rates, may substantially affect the morphology of wind-driven bow shocks and their non-thermal emission, if there is efficient particle acceleration in the forward shock.

 - **Abstract**
 The decay of Short-Lived Radioisotopes (SLRs) can be a significant source of heating early in protoplanetary systems, though how a protoplanetary disk becomes enriched with these SLRs far above the galactic background level remains an open question. Observational evidence suggests that this enrichment occurs during the period from when the disk forms to when it progresses into a protoplanetary system, and is homogenous throughout the resultant planetary system. Whilst SLRs such as 26Al and 60Fe can be injected into disks through interaction with Wolf-Rayet winds and supernovae, these outflows can disrupt disks, and in the case of low-mass star-forming regions high-mass stars may not form at all. Recent research has determined the existence of AGB ``interlopers'', Asymptotic Giant Branch stars that pass close to or through star-forming regions that could be an alternative source of SLR enrichment to WR winds and supernovae. In this paper we study the effect of AGB interlopers on star-forming regions from a dynamical perspective, determining the enrichment amount of 26Al and 60Fe in disks within small clusters via numerous N-body simulations via a parameter space exploration. We find that enrichment is widespread from AGB stars, with efficient enrichment dependent on the time at which the interloper intersects the star-forming region. Velocity is a factor, though interlopers travelling at 30 km/s are capable of enriching many disks in a star-forming region assuming they encounter a disk when the interloper is more evolved.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers play an important role in many aspects of galaxy evolution, therefore, more accurate merger identifications are paramount for achieving a complete understanding of galaxy evolution. As we enter the era of very large imaging surveys, we are able to observe mergers extending to even lower masses and higher redshifts. Despite low-mass galaxies being more common, many previous merger identification methods were mostly calibrated for high-mass, local galaxies, which are easier to identify. To prepare for upcoming surveys, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using mock $\textit{HST}$ CANDELS images at $z \sim 1$ created from the IllustrisTNG50 cosmological simulation. We successfully identify galaxy mergers between a wide range of galaxies ($10^8M_\odot < M_\star < 10^{12.5}M_\odot$, and $\mu >1:10$), achieving overall accuracy, purity, and completeness of $\sim73\%$. We show, for the first time, that a CNN trained on this diverse set of galaxies is capable of identifying both major and minor mergers, early and late stage mergers, as well as nonmerging galaxies, similar to that of networks trained at lower redshifts and/or higher masses (with accuracies ranging between $66-80\%$) for the first time. We discuss the inherent limits of galaxy merger identification due to orientation angle and explore the confounding variables, such as star formation, to consider when applying to real data. This network enables the exploration of the impact of previously overlooked mergers of high mass ratio and low stellar masses on galaxy evolution in CANDELS, and can be expanded to surveys from $\textit{JWST}$, Rubin, $\textit{Roman}$, and $\textit{Euclid}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ionizing photon production efficiencies (${\xi}_{\rm ion}$) for 63 z=1.5-6.9 star-forming galaxies using precise nebular dust attenuation corrections from the JWST/AURORA survey. A subset of objects within AURORA have individually-determined nebular dust attenuation curves, which vary significantly in shape and normalization, resulting in reduced systematic uncertainty when constraining the total attenuation of H${\alpha}$ luminosity, and thus the intrinsic ionizing output within our sample. We find evidence for positive correlations between ${\xi}_{\rm ion}$ and redshift, equivalent width of [OIII]${\lambda}$5007, and O32=[OIII]${\lambda}$5007/[OII]${\lambda}$3726,3729, and negative correlations between ${\xi}_{\rm ion}$ and stellar attenuation, UV luminosity (L$_{\rm UV}$), stellar mass, and direct-method metallicity. We test alternate dust prescriptions within this sample, and find that the total attenuation is lower when using the commonly-assumed Galactic extinction curve or when assuming that stellar attenuation is equal to nebular attenuation. We also find that assuming either of these alternate dust prescriptions can change the slope of relationships between ${\xi}_{\rm ion}$ and galaxy property, notably inducing a flat trend between ${\xi}_{\rm ion}$ and L$_{\rm UV}$ within AURORA. While the novel nebular dust curves derived from AURORA spectroscopy reveal obscured ionizing photon production within star-forming galaxies at these redshifts, a more complete understanding of stellar attenuation is required to fully reduce dust systematics on ${\xi}_{\rm ion}$ for inclusion in reionization models.

 We review recent advances in the numerical modeling of turbulent flows and star formation. An overview of the most widely used simulation codes and their core capabilities is provided. We then examine methods for achieving the highest-resolution magnetohydrodynamical turbulence simulations to date, highlighting challenges related to numerical viscosity and resistivity. State-of-the-art approaches to modeling gravity and star formation are discussed in detail, including implementations of star particles and feedback from jets, winds, heating, ionization, and supernovae. We review the latest techniques for radiation hydrodynamics, including ray tracing, Monte Carlo, and moment methods, with comparisons between the flux-limited diffusion, moment-1, and variable Eddington tensor methods. The final chapter summarizes advances in cosmic-ray transport schemes, emphasizing their growing importance for connecting small-scale star formation physics with galaxy-scale evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-domain studies of mid-infrared and submillimeter variability have shown that at least half of protostars are variable. We present a statistical analysis of mid-infrared variability among young stellar objects (YSOs) in the distant, massive star-forming region W51 using NEOWISE data. From a catalog of 81 protostars, 527 disk objects, and 37,687 other sources including diskless pre-main sequence and evolved contaminants, we identified significant variability in the 3.4 um (W1) and 4.6 um (W2) bands. Because of W51's distance (~5.4 kpc) and extinction, the sample mainly includes intermediate- to high-mass YSOs (>2 Msun), unlike nearby regions dominated by low-mass stars. This mass bias may affect the observed variability. In W2, 11.1% of protostars, 7.6% of disk objects, and 0.6% of PMS+E sources showed secular variability, while 8.6%, 2.3%, and 0.5% showed stochastic variability; similar fractions were found in W1. The variability fraction and amplitude increase toward earlier stages. Protostars exhibit high-amplitude stochastic changes likely driven by dynamic accretion and extinction, whereas disk objects show more secular patterns-linear, curved, or periodic-possibly due to moderate accretion variations or disk geometry. Color-magnitude analysis shows that protostars generally redden as they brighten, consistent with enhanced dust emission or variable extinction, while disk objects show mixed trends: roughly balanced in W1 but more often bluer in W2, suggesting reduced extinction or hotspot modulation. These results highlight distinct mechanisms of variability across evolutionary stages and demonstrate that mid-infrared monitoring offers key insight into accretion and disk evolution in young stars.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST observations reveal numerous quiescent galaxies (QGs) at high redshift ($z \sim 4-8$), challenging models of early galaxy formation and quenching. Accurate number density estimates are crucial for comparison with theory but remain uncertain. We systematically study QGs at $0.5 < z < 8$ using a mass-complete sample from the JWST/PRIMER survey with deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging. The MIRI data, probing rest-frame near-infrared at $z \sim 3-8$, are vital for robust stellar mass measurement and QG identification. We find that nearly all photometrically selected, point-like QG candidates located in the UVJ QG region are actually "Little Red Dots", for which the UVJ colors were wrongly estimated due to inaccurate photometric redshift estimation. MIRI reduces significantly contamination to high-mass QGs from star-forming galaxies, yielding lower number densities than previous studies. The evolution of QG number density is strongly mass-dependent. The density of high-mass QGs ($\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) > 10.3$) decreases rapidly from $n = 1\times10^{-5}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z=3-4$ to $n=2\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z = 4-5$, becoming negligible ($n \lesssim 10^{-6}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ ) at $z > 5$. Conversely, low-mass QGs ($9<\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})<10.3$) maintain a nearly constant number density ($n\sim3\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$) across $z = 4-8$. This suggests low-mass QGs at $z > 4$ are likely temporarily quenched, akin to mini-quenched galaxies. Comparison with major hydrodynamical and semi-analytical models shows most underestimate high-mass QG densities at $z>4$ and fail to reproduce the constant low-mass QG density at $z>5$.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the stability of Milky Way analogs (MWAs) in the \texttt{TNG50} simulation against the growth of local axisymmetric instabilities, tracing their evolution from cosmic noon ($z=2.5$) to the present day ($z=0$). Using a two-component stability criterion that accounts for stars, gas, and the force field of the dark matter halo, we compute the net stability parameter ($Q_{T}$), the critical gas surface density ($\Sigma_{c}$), and the instability timescale ($\tau$) for 10 barred and 10 unbarred MWAs. We find that these galaxies remain stable to axisymmetric instabilities at all epochs, with $Q_{T}^{\min}>2$. The stability levels increase toward higher redshift, where enhanced gas velocity dispersion counterbalances the destabilizing effect of larger gas fractions. Further, the barred MWAs consistently show lower $Q_{T}^{\min}$ than unbarred ones. The gas density remains subcritical ($\Sigma_{g}<\Sigma_{c}$) across radii and epochs, implying that local axisymmetric instabilities are not the primary channel for star formation. Growth timescales are short (a few Myr) in central regions but increase exponentially to several Gyr in the outer disc, naturally explaining the concentration of star formation toward galactic centers. We study the effect of gas dissipation and turbulence in ISM and find that while MWAs are stable against axisymmetric instabilities $(Q_{T}>1)$, a combination of gas dissipation and turbulence in ISM can destabilize the disc at small scales even when $Q_{T}>1$.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate galaxy populations in the HS1700+64 protocluster at $z=2.30$, characterized by two prominent linear filaments traced by spatially extended Ly$\alpha$ blobs. We conducted a wide area mapping of emission line galaxies across the protocluster using the unique combination of three matched narrow-band filters, corresponding to Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and [OIII] emission lines at $z=2.30$. We find that H$\alpha$ emitters are strongly clustered at the intersection of the filaments, suggesting a protocluster core. In contrast, Ly$\alpha$ emitters tend to avoid the dense region and the filaments, likely due to the resonant scattering of Ly$\alpha$ photons by HII gas and/or enhanced dust attenuation in galaxies associated with these structures. These findings support a scenario in which cold gas flows via filaments and to the core, fed by the cold-stream mode accretion in the early phase of protocluster assembly, and promoting active star formation there. Further evidence of the scenario comes from the alignment of massive, evolved galaxies in those filaments traced by distant red galaxies, suggesting accelerated galaxy growth in the filaments in the early Universe. This study clearly shows observationally that accelerated galaxy formation takes place not only in the protocluster core but also in the associated surrounding filamentary structure. This underscores the critical role of large-scale filaments in efficiently accumulating the cold gas and channeling it to galaxies therein and to the protocluster core. Such vigorous gas assembly facilitates star formation activity and drives galaxy growth in the early stage of cluster formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Jets and outflows are key components of low-mass star formation, regulating accretion and shaping the surrounding molecular clouds. These flows, traced by molecular species at (sub)millimeter wavelengths (e.g., CO, SiO, SO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH) and by atomic, ionized, and molecular lines in the infrared (e.g., H$_2$, [Fe II], [S I]), originate from protostellar accretion disks deeply embedded within dusty envelopes. Jets play a crucial role in removing angular momentum from the disk, thereby enabling continued mass accretion, while directly preserving a record of the protostar's outflow history and potentially providing indirect insights into its accretion history. Recent advances in high-resolution, high-sensitivity observations, particularly with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the infrared and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at (sub)millimeter wavelengths, have revolutionized studies of protostellar jets and outflows. These instruments provide complementary views of warm, shock-excited gas and cold molecular component of the jet-outflow system. In this review, we discuss the current status of observational studies that reveal detailed structures, kinematics, and chemical compositions of protostellar jets and outflows. Recent analyses of mass-loss rates, velocities, rotation, molecular abundances, and magnetic fields provide critical insights into jet launching mechanisms, disk evolution, and the potential formation of binary systems and planets. The synergy of JWST's infrared sensitivity and ALMA's high-resolution imaging is advancing our understanding of jets and outflows. Future large-scale, high-resolution surveys with these facilities are expected to drive major breakthroughs in outflow research.
#### Limits of Standard Tidal Models at Quaoar: Matching Weywot's Orbit, Missing the Spin

 - **Abstract**
 Weywot, Quaoar's small satellite, follows a nearly circular orbit at a distance of 12.9 times Quaoar's diameter and coexists with a compact ring system. Nevertheless, Quaoar's flattening of 0.16, slow 17.7hr rotation and Weywot's low mass are difficult to reconcile with conventional tidal-evolution theory. We assess whether standard tides can reproduce the present-day architecture of the Quaoar-Weywot system and identify the initial conditions required. Orbit-averaged integrations spanning 4.5Gyr were carried out with two formalisms: (i) a constant phase-lag (CPL) and (ii) an Andrade creep-tide (ACT) framework. With the nominal Weywot mass, both tidal prescriptions converge on Weywot's observed orbital distance for a wide range of initial orbital distances and eccentricities; eccentricity is damped and present-day tidal torques are negligible, rendering the orbit quasi-stationary. Quaoar's spin, however, remains essentially unchanged from its inferred primordial period based on its present-day flattening, and does not reproduce the observed value. A match is possible only if Weywot is 5-10x more massive than current estimates and if its initial eccentricity is finely tuned; such scenarios are inconsistent with occultation-derived masses and imply an implausibly dense satellite. Based on the best fitting viscoelastic parameters, the most plausible composition for Quaoar is found to be a partially differentiated dwarf planet containing roughly equal masses of silicate rock and H2O-dominated warm (150-180K) ices. Standard tidal models reproduce Weywot's semimajor axis but cannot account for Quaoar's slow 17.7hr rotation without invoking an unrealistically massive satellite or external torques, suggesting that non-tidal processes - such as a largely primordial spin, early satellite loss, or a retrograde secondary giant impact - must have influenced Quaoar's rotational evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar rotation has long been recognized as important to the evolution of stars, by virtue of the chemical mixing it can induce and how it interacts with binary mass transfer. Binary interaction and rapid rotation are both common in massive stars and involve processes of angular momentum distribution and transport. An important question is how this angular momentum transport leads to the creation of two important classes of rapidly rotating massive stars, Be stars defined by disklike emission lines, and Bn stars defined by rotationally broadened absorption lines. A related question is what limits this rotation places on how conservative the mass transfer can be. Central to addressing these issues is knowledge of how close to rotational break-up stars can get before they produce a disk. Here we calculate diagnostics of this rotational criticality using the continuum polarization arising from a combination of rotational stellar distortion (i.e., oblateness) and redistribution of stellar flux (i.e., gravity darkening), and compare polarizations produced in the von Zeipel approximation with the approach of Espinosa Lara & Rieutard (ELR). Both produce similar photospheric polarizations that rise significantly in the far ultraviolet (FUV) for B stars, with a stronger signal in the von Zeipel case. For early main-sequence and subgiant stars, it reaches a maximum of ~1% at 140 nm for stars rotating at 98% of critical, when seen edge-on. Rotational rates above 80% critical result in polarizations of several tenths of a percent, at high inclination. These predicted stable signal strengths indicate that determinations of near-critical rotations in B stars could be achieved with future spectropolarimetric instrumentation that can reach deep into the FUV, such as CASSTOR, the Polstar mission concept, or the POLLUX detector design.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted high-precision timing of PSR J1946+2052 to determine the masses of the two neutron stars in the system, test general relativity (GR) and assessed the system's potential for future measurement of the moment of inertia of the pulsar. We analysed seven years of timing data from the Arecibo 305-m radio telescope, the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The data processing accounted for dispersion measure variations and relativistic spin precession-induced profile evolution. We employed both DDFWHE and DDGR binary models to measure the spin parameters, kinematic parameters and orbital parameters. The timing campaign has resulted in the precise measurement of five post-Keplerian parameters, which yield very precise masses for the system and three tests of general relativity. One of these is the second most precise test of the radiative properties of gravity to date: the intrinsic orbital decay, $\dot{P}_{\rm b,int}=-1.8288(16)\times10^{-12}\rm\,s\,s^{-1}$, represents $1.00005(91)$ of the GR prediction, indicating that the theory has passed this stringent test. The other two tests, of the Shapiro delay parameters, have precisions of 6\% and 5\% respectively; this is caused by the moderate orbital inclination of the system, $\sim 74^{\circ}$; the measurements of the Shapiro delay parameters also agree with the GR predictions. Additionally, we analysed the higher-order contributions of $\dot{\omega}$, including the Lense-Thirring contribution. Both the second post-Newtonian and the Lense-Thirring contributions are larger than the current uncertainty of $\dot{\omega}$ ($\delta\dot{\omega}=4\times10^{-4}\,\rm deg\,yr^{-1}$), leading to the higher-order correction for the total mass.

 - **Abstract**
 We cannot understand planet formation without understanding disc evolutionary processes. However, there is currently ambiguity about how protoplanetary discs transport angular momentum (e.g. via viscosity or winds) and the relative contributions and interplay of different dispersal mechanisms. A key difficulty is that for any given system only a handful of disc parameters are usually available to constrain theoretical models. Recent observations of the d203-504 disc in Orion, have yielded values of the stellar accretion rate, external photoevaporative mass loss rate, stellar mass and the disc size and mass. In particular, having the combination of accretion rate and external photoevaporative rate is new. Using this unique combination of observables, we run a suite of disc evolution simulations to constrain which scenarios can match the observed values. We explore both viscous and MHD wind-driven discs, finding that they best match observations when the angular momentum transport $\alpha$ parameter is $3\times10^{-4}\leq\alpha_{\nu}\leq2\times10^{-3}$ for viscous discs, and $2\times10^{-3}\leq\alpha_{\rm DW}\leq10^{-2}$ for MHD wind-driven discs, consistent with other estimates in the literature. As well constraining the disc properties and evolution, the d203-504 disc allows us to define a new irradiation age, since in order to match observations, it was required that the disc had only just appeared in the extreme UV environment it is currently exposed to (a known issue for proplyds referred to as the proplyd lifetime problem). This indicates that it is either very young, i.e. <0.1 Myr, or it has been shielded until recently, which would have protected the planet forming reservoir and helped facilitate planet growth despite it now residing in a harsh UV environment.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an implementation of radiative transfer with flux-limited diffusion (FLD) for the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO} and use the method in a physical model for the formation of protostars with non-ideal radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD). We follow previous work in splitting the additional terms to the hydrodynamical equations arising from the inclusion of radiation into terms to be integrated explicitly and implicitly, as the diffusion and coupling terms would impose very restrictive timestep criteria. We validate the scheme with standard test problems for radiation diffusion, matter-gas coupling, and radiative shocks from the literature. Our implementation is compatible with local timestepping, which often presents problems for implicit schemes, and we found very good agreement with results obtained with global timesteps. We present an example application of the new implementation to the collapse of a $1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ molecular cloud core to a second Larson core modelled with radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics. A high-velocity jet with v$_{\rm rad}> 10\, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ is self-consistently launched from the second core, nested within the first core, which produces a lower-velocity magnetorotational outflow. We observe magnetic field amplification up to more than $\vert \mathbf{B}\vert_{\rm max}>10^5$~G in the second core, which is surrounded by a small ($<0.5$~au) disk. This application demonstrates the robustness of our scheme in multi-scale and high-resolution simulations on arbitrary meshes and, as such, the model can be readily used for further simulations of protostar formation at high resolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of high-redshift galaxies exhibiting a steep spectral UV downturn potentially indicative of two-photon continuum emission marks a turning point in our search for signatures of top-heavy star formation in the early Universe. We develop a photometric search method for identifying further nebular-dominated galaxy candidates, whose nebular continuum dominates over the starlight, due to the high ionising photon production efficiencies $\xi_\mathrm{ion}$ associated with massive star formation. We utilise the extensive medium-band imaging from JADES, which enables the identification of Balmer jumps across a wide range of redshifts ($1.5 < z < 8.5$), through the deficit in rest-frame optical continuum level. As Balmer jumps are a general recombination feature of young starbursts ($\lesssim 3$~Myr), we further demand a high observed $\log\, (\xi_\mathrm{ion, obs}/\mathrm{(Hz\ erg^{-1})}) > 25.60$ to power the strong nebular continuum, together with a relatively non-blue UV slope indicating a lack of stellar continuum emission. Our nebular-dominated candidates, constituting ${\sim}$10% of galaxies at $z \sim 6$ (decreasing to ${\sim}$3% at $z \sim 2$, not completeness-corrected) are faint in the rest-frame optical (median $M_\mathrm{opt} = -17.95$) with extreme line emission (median $\mathrm{EW}_\mathrm{H\alpha,rest} = 1567$ Å, $\mathrm{EW}_\mathrm{[O\ III] + H\beta,rest} = 2244$ Å). However, hot H II region temperatures, collisionally-enhanced two-photon continuum emission, and strong UV lines are expected to accompany top-heavy star formation. Thus nebular-dominated galaxies do not necessarily exhibit the biggest Balmer jumps, nor the largest $\xi_\mathrm{ion, obs}$ or reddest UV slopes. Hence continuum spectroscopy is ultimately required to establish the presence of a two-photon downturn in our candidates, thus advancing our understanding of primordial star formation and AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar feedback drives winds and outflows critical to the baryon cycles of low-mass galaxies whose shallow gravitational potential wells make them particularly susceptible to mass and metal loss through outflows. However, spatially resolved observations of stellar-feedback-driven outflows are limited due to their low-surface brightness and transient nature. We present the pilot of a larger multi-wavelength study searching for and quantifying stellar-feedback-driven winds and outflows on both spatially and globally resolved scales for a sample of 40 nearby low-mass galaxies. We search for outflow signatures in the star-forming dwarf galaxy NGC 3741 using new optical imaging and spectroscopy from the WIYN 3.5m telescope in conjunction with VLA 21cm observations and local star formation histories derived from resolved HST photometry. With this extensive dataset, we compare the neutral and ionized gas morphologies and kinematics, calculate mass-loading factors, and investigate spatial variations in the star formation history of NGC 3741. Though the galaxy is experiencing a burst in star formation, we find little evidence of strong outflows and calculate very low mass-loading factors. We suggest that, though star formation activity has increased dramatically in the central region of the galaxy over the last 40 Myr, the star formation rate is not high enough to produce a sufficient amount of high mass stars responsible for fueling outflows. Future analysis of the larger sample will allow us to explore how stellar feedback impacts mass loss on local scales, providing a deeper understanding of the interplay between stellar feedback and the interstellar medium in low-mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 I examine recent observations of the type Ia supernova remnant (SNR Ia) Tycho and conclude that Tycho is an SN Ia inside a planetary nebula (SNIP). The observations reveal two opposite protrusions, termed ears, projected on the main shell of Tycho. The pair of ear structures resembles that of the SNRs Ia Kepler, SNR G299-2.9, and SNR G1.9+0.3, which earlier studies considered as SNIPs. The requirement that the explosion occurs within hundreds of thousands of years after the formation of the planetary nebula (by the second star to evolve) makes the core-degenerate scenario the most likely for Tycho. Several other possible scenarios lead to an SNIP, but they are unlikely for Tycho. The identification of Tycho as an SNIP leads to two general conclusions. (1) The fraction of SNIPs among normal SNe Ia is very large, ~70-90%. Namely, the vast majority of normal SNe Ia are SNIPs. (2) To accommodate the large fraction of SNIPs, the delay time distribution of normal SNe Ia includes not only the stellar evolution timescale (as usually assumed), but also includes pockets of younger stellar populations in galaxies without ongoing star formation; the SNIPs come from the younger stellar populations in galaxies.

 Recent direct observations of atypically shaped rubble-pile satellites of sub-km asteroids in form of the spherically oblate Dimorphos and bilobate Selam challenge classical binary asteroid formation theories, which only explain the predominantly elongated population. This study further explores a rubble-pile satellite formation scenario for binary asteroid systems involving debris disks by investigating how mergers between moonlets with impact velocities below the mutual escape speed (sub-escape-velocity mergers) and tidal disruptions can create atypically shaped moons. We simulated sub-escape-velocity mergers between moonlets and studied the resulting structural evolution of the formed moon in a tidal environment using the polyhedral discrete elements method N-body code GRAINS. Firstly, we find that the shapes of rubble-pile moons formed by mergers in this regime are highly dependent on the shape and initial orientation of the involved moonlets. This can be explained by the moonlets largely retaining their individual structures during the impact. Secondly, we observe that mass-loss via tidal disruption for a bilobate object occurs in discrete regimes of distance to the primary. Closer to the primary, the innermost lobe is completely stripped off, while only a small piece of it is lost further out. Due to moonlets largely retaining their shape after undergoing a sub-escape-velocity merger, it is necessary to account for their non-sphericity to accurately model satellite formation in circumasteroidal debris disks. Moreover, the reshaping of merged objects via tidal disruption and distortion can produce oblate spheroid moons such as Dimorphos and highly elongated bilobate satellites with distinct necks such as Selam.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the MaNGA Visual Morphology (MVM) catalogue, featuring a visual morphological classification of 10,059 galaxies in the final MaNGA sample. By combining SDSS and DESI Legacy Survey (DLS) images, we classified galaxies into 13 Hubble types, detected tidal features, categorized bars into different families, and estimated concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness. The depth of the DLS images allowed us to identify structural details that were not evident in the SDSS images, resulting in a more reliable classification. After correcting for volume completeness, we find a bimodal distribution in galaxy morphology, with peaks in S0 and Scd types, and a transition zone around S0a-Sa types. Bars are present in 54% of disc galaxies with inclinations < 70, following a bimodal trend with peaks in Sab-Sb and Scd-Sd types. Tidal structures are identified in ~13% of galaxies, particularly in massive E-Sa and low-mass Sdm-Irr galaxies. We derive the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and decompose it into each morphological type. Schechter functions accurately describe the latter, while a triple Schechter function describes the total GSMF, associating three characteristic masses with different galaxy types. The abundance of early-type galaxies remains constant at low masses; they are predominantly satellites. We confirm that later-type galaxies are generally younger, bluer, more star-forming, and less metal-rich compared to early-type galaxies. Additionally, we find evidence connecting morphology and stellar mass to the star formation history of galaxies. The MVM catalogue provides a robust dataset for investigating galaxy evolution, secular processes, and machine learning-based morphological classifications.
