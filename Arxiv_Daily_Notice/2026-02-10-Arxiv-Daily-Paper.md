 - **Abstract**
 The presence of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters leads to a complex dynamical environment that significantly influences the evolution of binary stars, which in turn impacts the evolution of the cluster itself. For this study, we used a series of Monte Carlo simulations run with the MOCCA code to investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of binary stars in globular clusters hosting two distinct stellar populations. We explored how global binary properties such as incidence, fraction, and spatial distribution evolve over time due to the unique dynamical environment associated with each population. Our results show how binaries in the more centrally concentrated second population (P2) experience increased rates of hardening and disruption relative to the first population (P1), leading to distinct radial profiles in binary incidence and fraction. We also demonstrate the difference in spatial mixing timescales for binaries compared to single stars, where binary stars in each population retain some memory of their initial configurations even after complete single star mixing. Additionally, we investigated the formation and evolution of mixed binaries (binaries composed of a P1 component and a P2 component), which form primarily within the core through dynamical interactions. Finally, we studied main sequence--white dwarf binaries and find that they represent a larger fraction of binaries in P1 compared to P2. The results of this paper highlight the interplay between cluster dynamics and the evolution of binary stars and how binaries can act as tracers of the cluster's initial conditions and dynamical evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation feedback may heat and remove gas from galaxies in a process that quenches ongoing star formation and shapes the evolution of galaxies. Potential impacts from these processes can be seen in the complex and interconnected signatures of AGN and star formation activity throughout a galaxy. Here, we analyze archival integral field unit (IFU) data for the nearby Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1365, as observed with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Our analysis probes the ionization and kinematic properties of NGC 1365 at high spatial resolution over unprecedentedly large physical scales (approximately 40 kpc), allowing us to trace the effects of feedback throughout nearly an entire galaxy. We use these optical IFU data in conjunction with observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Chandra X-ray Observatory to analyze and compare maps of emission line flux, ionization state, star formation, and gas kinematics. In doing so, we identify a region of BPT-identified unexpectedly high ionization relative to surrounding areas in the star forming arms, and work to identify its source, finding that shock heating may play a significant role. Results from this analysis allow us to place constraints on the relative impact of AGN and star formation processes on the star forming gas in NGC 1365, as well as begin to inform our understanding on the global impacts of feedback in galaxy populations as a whole.

 - **Abstract**
 The CASPER (Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronic Research) toolflow is a widely used framework for designing and implementing digital signal processing systems, particularly in the field of radio astronomy. It provides a set of tools and libraries that enable researchers to create custom hardware and software solutions for processing astronomical data. The CASPER toolflow has been instrumental in the development of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based digital instruments for various radio telescopes, enabling for real-time data processing and analysis. However, the current frontend tool that CASPER uses for high-level FPGA design is based on Model Composer integrated into MATLAB/Simulink, which is a proprietary software. In this paper, we introduce Scilab as a new frontend tool for the CASPER toolflow. Scilab is an open-source software platform for numerical computation and data visualization, which offers a similar environment to MATLAB/Simulink for designing CASPER blocks, generating FPGA Intellectual Property (IP) cores, and simulating Digital Signal Processing (DSP) systems. We present our implementation of Scilab in the CASPER toolflow and demonstrate its capabilities by developing an FPGA based spectrometer on a RFSoC4x2, a commonly used CASPER platform well suited to radio astronomy applications. We have also developed Scilab support for other CASPER compatible platforms. Our results show that Scilab can successfully be used as an alternate frontend for CASPER-based designs.

 - **Abstract**
 Imagining what life on other planets, and intelligent life in particular, may be like is a long-running theme in human culture. It is a manifestation of the innate human curiosity about the Cosmos, and it has inspired numerous works of art and folklore, including whole literary and other media genres. It is a profound question, with philosophical and existential implications. There is also an obvious connection with religious beliefs, as gods and other superhuman beings were imagined in the heavens. Speculations about alien beings grew in time, and today, it is a scientific subject of astrobiology, and it is pursued through serious searches for life and intelligence in the universe. However, almost all imaginings of the alien map terrestrial life forms and human cultural, historical, and psychological phenomena to the putative aliens. This lack of individual and collective imagination may reflect our biological and cultural evolution, as our minds are formed through our experiences, perceptions of the world, and interactions with our terrestrial and human environments. As such, imagining aliens is mainly a cultural phenomenon and may reflect the intrinsic cognitive limitations of the human mind. Interestingly, we did create what is effectively an alien intelligence on this planet in the form of now rapidly evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI). As its capabilities grow, it may give us new insights into what extraterrestrial advanced intelligences may be like.
#### Clump-Scale Dust Attenuation in Epoch of Reionization Galaxies: Spatially Resolved Properties from FirstLight Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding dust attenuation in galaxies at both integrated and spatially resolved scales is fundamental for accurately determining the physical properties of galaxies. Recent high-spatial-resolution observations with ALMA and JWST enable investigations of spatially resolved properties in high-redshift galaxies ($z \gtrsim 6$), but spatial variations in dust properties remain poorly constrained. We use cosmological zoom-in simulations combined with post-processing dust radiative transfer calculations for 376 clumpy galaxies at $z=6$-$9$ with stellar masses of $M_* \gtrsim 10^9 \, M_\odot$. For each system, we investigate dust attenuation and re-emission properties for three components: system-integrated, individual clumps, and diffuse regions. We find that system-integrated attenuation curves are grayer than the Calzetti curve, even when assuming MW- or SMC-type dust. Attenuation curves of individual clumps are even grayer, while diffuse regions exhibit steeper curves owing to enhanced scattering in optically thin environments. Since the effects of optical depth and dust-star geometry are intrinsically degenerate in attenuation curves, we introduce a toy model based on the IRX-$\Delta\beta$ plane, where $\Delta\beta$ denotes the difference between attenuated and intrinsic UV slopes. Applying this framework, we find that clumps have dust column densities approximately an order of magnitude higher than system-integrated values and exhibit co-spatial or dust-extended geometries. In contrast, system-integrated attenuation reflects star-extended geometries driven by contributions from optically thin diffuse regions. We apply this framework to REBELS-IFU galaxies at $z \sim 7$ and find good agreement with our simulation predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a lithium dip (Li-dip) in the stellar "Snake" (age = $35 \pm 5$ Myr), challenging the classical view that Li-dips emerge only at ages $\gtrsim 150$ Myr. Using high-resolution spectra from GALAH DR4 ($R \sim 28,000$) for 211 member stars, we identify a clear depletion feature in a $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ range of 6200--6800 K with a depth of $\Delta A(\mathrm{Li}) \approx 0.40$ dex. Our analysis reveals two key advances: the Li-dip appears $\gtrsim 100$ Myr earlier than the previous observations, and within the dip temperature range, a significant correlation is found between rotational velocity and lithium depletion. Specifically, fast rotators ($v \sin i > 25$ km s$^{-1}$) exhibit stronger lithium depletion than slow rotators ($v \sin i < 25$ km s$^{-1}$). This trend suggests that faster rotators develop stronger rotational shear at the convective-radiative boundary, which enhances turbulent mixing and accelerates lithium destruction. It is also found that the lower temperature edge of the lithium plateau can reach as low as 5500 K for the young open clusters.
#### Active Galactic Nuclei and STaR fOrmation in Nearby Galaxies AGNSTRONG. III. A Study on Ionized and Warm Molecular Gas Outflows of 6 Type-2 AGNs

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nucleus (AGN)-driven gas outflows are one of the best tracers of AGN feedback in action, as these powerful outflows expel/heat or compress the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM), thus quenching or enhancing star-forming activity in their hosts. Studying the kinematics of outflows in different gas phases is crucial for comprehending how AGNs impact the ISM within their host galaxies. However, the differences in the physical natures of ionized and warm molecular gas outflows remain largely unexplored. To obtain a complete picture of AGN outflows and their feedback effects, we present a study of both ionized and warm molecular gas outflows in six type-2 AGNs ($z<0.1$) that exhibit strong ionized outflows in previous optical observations. Utilizing the Triple Spectrograph and Double Spectrograph instruments on the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope, we conduct spatially resolved measurements in the slit direction of strong emission lines from both ionized and warm molecular gas, such as $\rm [O\ III]$, $\rm Pa\alpha$, $\rm H_{2}$ 1-0 S(1), etc., allowing for a direct comparison of their outflow properties. One out of six AGNs shows significant ionized and warm molecular outflows in near-infrared bands, exhibiting the most powerful kinematics and highest luminosity. A positive correlation between the kinematics and AGN luminosity is shown, suggesting that more luminous AGNs, which reflect higher levels of AGN activity, tend to have a greater impact on the gases, probably driving the outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we present a newly developed GRPIC code framework called FPIC, providing a detailed description of the Maxwell-equations solver, of the particle ``pushers'', and of the other algorithms that are needed in this approach. We describe in detail the code, which is written in Fortran and exploits parallel architectures using MPI directives both for the fields and particles. FPIC adopts spherical Kerr-Schild coordinates, which encode the overall spherical topology of the problem while remaining regular at the event horizon. The Maxwell equations are evolved using a finite-difference time-domain solver with a leapfrog scheme, while multiple particle ``pushers'' are implemented for the evolution of the particles. In addition to well-known algorithms, we introduce a novel hybrid method that dynamically switches between the most appropriate scheme based on the violation of the Hamiltonian energy. We first present results for neutral particles orbiting around black holes, both in the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, monitoring the evolution of the Hamiltonian error across different integration schemes. We apply our hybrid approach, showing that it is capable of achieving improved energy conservation at reduced computational cost. We apply FPIC to investigate the Wald solution, first in electrovacuum and subsequently in plasma-filled configurations. In the latter case, particles with negative energy at infinity are present inside the ergosphere, indicating that the Penrose process is active. Finally, we present the split-monopole solution in a plasma-filled environment and successfully reproduce the Blandford-Znajek luminosity, finding very good agreement with analytical predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 SXP 31.0 is an X-ray source in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) that was first identified as a Be X-ray Binary (BeXRB) system when it went into X-ray outbusrst in 1998. It is now known to consist of an OBe main sequence star and a neutron star with a spin period of 31s. In 2025 a new X-ray outburst phase began with the source exhibiting a luminosities approaching the Eddington limit of 10^38 erg/s. Unusually, H-alpha images show it has a surrounding halo whose nature has not been clear. In this paper, we report new observations of this halo, including the first multi-fibre Integrated Flux Unit (IFU) observations, which identify this emission as probably a coincidental HII region. The X-ray, UV & optical data cover a period of ~200d and reveal that the source underwent two bright, back-to-back, Type II outbursts in 2025 - a rare occurrence for any BeXRB system.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disk substructures are thought to play a crucial role in disk evolution and planet formation. Population studies of disks large-sample size surveys show that substructures, and their rapid formation, are needed to reproduce the observed spectral indices. Moreover, they enable the simultaneous reproduction of the observed spectral index and size-luminosity distributions. This study aims to investigate the necessity of substructures and predict their characteristics to reproduce gas-to-dust size ratios observed in the Lupus star-forming region. We performed a population synthesis study of gas and dust evolution in disks using a two-population model (two-pop-py) and the DustPy code. We considered the effects of viscous evolution, dust growth, fragmentation, transport, and external photoevaporation. The simulated population distributions were obtained by post-processing the resulting disk profiles of surface density, maximum grain size, and disk temperature. Although substructures help reduce the discrepancy between simulated and observed disk gas-to-dust size ratios; even when accounting for external photoevaporation, they do not fully resolve it. Only specific initial conditions in disks undergoing viscous evolution with external photoevaporation can reproduce the observations, highlighting a fine-tuning problem. While substructured disks reproduce dust size and spectral index, they tend to overestimate gas radii. The results ultimately highlight the main challenge of simultaneously reproducing gas and dust sizes. One possible explanation is that the outermost substructure is linked to the disk truncation radius, which determines the gas radius, or that substructures are frequent enough to always be near the gas outer radius.
#### Properties of Galactic Outflows Driven by Starburst at Cosmic Noon: Insights from Hydrodynamical Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate starburst-driven galactic outflows in low-mass galaxies ($9.0 < \log(M_*/M_\odot) < 10.0$) at cosmic noon using high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations based on a framework that can reproduce the multiphase outflows in M82. The simulations produce starbursts lasting 20-30 Myr, with peak star formation rates of 2-68 M$_\odot \,\rm{yr}^{-1}$. Outflow properties vary strongly with time, radial distance to galaxy center, stellar mass, and gas fraction, exhibiting velocities of 50-1000 $\,\rm{km\,s}^{-1}$, mass outflow rates of 0.3-20 M$_\odot \,\rm{yr}^{-1}$, and mass loading factors, $\eta_\mathrm{M}$, of 0.24-6.26. The cool phase ($8000 < T \le 2 \times 10^4$ K) dominates the outflow, and properties of the cool and warm phases are broadly consistent with observations. At $M_*= 10^{9.5}\,M_\odot$, average $\eta_\mathrm{M}$ for the total, cool, and warm phases are $\sim$1.2, 0.75, and 0.25, respectively. The mass loading factor decreases with increasing galaxy stellar mass, but increases with star formation rate. Given strong temporal and spatial evolution, scaling slopes from limited samples should be treated with caution. Our total $\eta_\mathrm{M}$ values are higher than FIRE-2 by 0.06 dex but lower than EAGLE and TNG50 by 0.50 and 0.84 dex. Accounting for methodological differences in outflow measurement reduces these gaps to 0.2-0.4 dex, suggesting that part of the discrepancy between observations and simulations reported in the literature may arise from inconsistent definitions and measurement methods, though differences in individual phases persist. Larger observational and simulation samples, together with consistent methods for measuring outflow properties, are required to draw robust conclusions about the scaling relations of galactic outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of persistent radio sources (PRSs) associated with repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) has shed light on the immediate environments and possible progenitors of these FRBs. The confirmed PRSs may support the theory that FRB progenitors are compact central engines, whilst the non-detections suggest diversity of FRB's local environment. We perform a subarcsecond-resolution MeerKAT search at 1.28 GHz on 25 well-localised FRB positions provided by ASKAP and MeerTRAP. We detect 14 radio sources and provide flux upper limits for 12 non-detections (both these numbers include a source that was detected during two epochs of observation, and not detected during one epoch, adding up to 26). One radio source shows variability as seen in flux variations over three epochs of observation. Archival optical data reveal excesses in the direction of 13 detected radio sources. Similarly for four sources in the X-ray band, with one possibly being a high-energy signature of a radio galaxy core. Since we cannot definitively classify our detected radio sources as PRSs, future high-resolution observations with e-MERLIN will be required to resolve the radio emission and pronounce on the presence of compact PRSs associated with the 14 detected sources presented here.
#### Twisted Pseudodisk and Asymmetric Mass Accretion on the Circumstellar Disk

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.07741

 - **Abstract**
 We model gas inflow patterns onto circumstellar disks and the evolution of the pseudodisk using three-dimensional resistive MHD simulations. Starting from a prestellar core without turbulence and with a misalignment between the initial magnetic field and rotation axis, the simulations are performed for $\sim10^5$ yr after protostar formation. After disk formation, the magnetic field around the disk becomes significantly distorted due to the disk rotational motion. Consequently, the structure of the pseudodisk also evolves into a complex morphology. As a result, both accretion onto the disk and outflow become asymmetric and anisotropic. Accretion to the disk occurs primarily through narrow-channel flows or streams. The time evolution of the infalling envelope leads to non-steady accretion onto the disk, which in turn causes variability in the mass accretion onto the central protostar. This study demonstrates that complex infalling envelope structures and channelized accretion flows onto the disk naturally arise even without assuming turbulence or external asymmetric inflows.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistical study of pulsars and millisecond pulsars (MSPs) based on multiwavelength observations in the Galactic Field and Globular Clusters. We examine their emission properties, timing behavior, and spatial distributions, and discuss how theoretical models are required to interpret these observational trends. We focus on the magnetic field spin relation, including spin up through accretion in binaries and spin down driven by magnetic dipole radiation. Using numerical tools such as NBODY6++GPU, CMC, and COMPASS, we explore how dynamical interactions and binary evolution shape the properties of compact objects. Despite major progress, several open questions remain regarding binary interactions, magnetic field evolution, and the incorporation of pulsar physics into large scale simulations. Our analysis highlights the need for improved modeling frameworks to better understand the formation pathways and long term evolution of pulsars and MSPs.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of winds is among the uncertainties related to the growth of giant planets. Such circumplanetary outflows have been proposed to explain kinematic and chemical structures in protoplanetary disks. We investigate the immediate impact of circumplanetary outflows on the circumstellar disk environment, the planetary vicinity, and planetary growth. We performed three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using \texttt{FARGO3D}, implementing a parametric wind launched from the vicinity of an embedded planet. Although the imposed configurations for the outflows do not significantly alter the global structure of the disk, they do substantially redistribute material in the vicinity of the embedded planet. In particular, the wind redirects accretion flows from polar to equatorial latitudes, resulting in variable accretion patterns over time. Although the mass accretion rate variations depend on the efficiency of the outflows, their presence diminishes the accretion rate over time and the total mass reservoir within the Hill sphere and the planet's direct vicinity, potentially slowing or limiting planetary growth.

 - **Abstract**
 This second paper in our series investigates the evolutionary mechanisms that shape pulsars and millisecond pulsars (MSPs) across different astrophysical environments. We focus on the physical processes that govern spin evolution, magnetic field decay, binary interactions, and recycling pathways. Using observational constraints together with theoretical models, we examine how accretion, magnetic braking, and dynamical encounters contribute to the long-term evolution of compact objects. We also explore how these mechanisms differ between the Galactic Field and Globular Clusters, where stellar densities and interaction rates vary significantly. By integrating insights from population studies and numerical tools such as NBODY6++GPU, CMC, and COMPASS, we aim to clarify the dominant channels that lead to the formation and transformation of pulsars and MSPs. Our results highlight key uncertainties in current models and outline the physical ingredients required for more accurate simulations of compact object evolution.
#### A comprehensive catalogue of high-mass X-ray binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud detected during the first eROSITA all-sky survey

 - **Abstract**
 The Magellanic Clouds, the closest star-forming galaxies to the Milky Way, offer an excellent environment to study high-mass X-ray binaries. While the Small Magellanic Cloud has been thoroughly investigated with over 120 systems identified, the Large Magellanic Cloud has lacked a complete survey due to its large angular size. Most prior studies targeted central or high-star-formation regions. The SRG/eROSITA all-sky surveys now enable a comprehensive coverage of the LMC, particularly due to its close vicinity to the south ecliptic pole. This work aims to improve our understanding of the HMXB population in the LMC by building a flux-limited catalogue. This allows us to compare sample properties with those of HMXB populations in other nearby galaxies. Using detections during the first eROSITA all-sky survey, we cross-matched X-ray positions with optical and infrared catalogues to identify candidate HMXBs. We assigned flags based on multi-wavelength follow-up observations and archival data, using properties of known LMC HMXBs. These flags defined confidence classes for our candidates. We detect sources down to X-ray luminosities of a few $10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, resulting in a catalogue of 53 objects, including 28 confirmed HMXBs and 21 new eROSITA detections. We identify several likely supergiant systems, including a candidate supergiant fast X-ray transient with phase-dependent flares. We find three Be stars with likely white dwarf companions. Two of the Be/WD candidates show steady luminosities across four eROSITA scans, unlike the post-nova states seen in the majority of previous Be/WD reports. Our catalogue is the first to cover the entire LMC since the ROSAT era, providing a basis for statistical population studies. Using the HMXB population, we estimate the LMC star-formation rate to be $(0.22^{+0.06}_{-0.07})$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, which is in agreement with other tracers.
#### A Minimal Interpretation of the Galactic Cosmic-Ray Spectrum from GeV to PeV Energies

 - **Abstract**
 High-precision measurements of the cosmic-ray (CR) proton spectrum have revealed significant deviations from a simple power-law behaviour. These deviations are characterised by three prominent features: (i) a progressive spectral hardening above approximately 200 GeV, (ii) an excess between 10 and 30 TeV (the ``multi-TeV bump''), followed by a sharp turnover around 100 TeV, and (iii) a pronounced structure between 0.1 and 10 PeV (the ``PeV bump''). We propose a minimal two cosmic-ray population framework that consistently accounts for the observed CR proton spectrum across six decades in energy, from GeV to PeV. In this scenario, the spectral complexity arises naturally from a transition between two Galactic CR proton populations in the 10-100 TeV energy range. The low-energy population exhibits a sharp cutoff at tens of TeV, while a second, higher-energy population emerges and dominates above 100 TeV, terminating with a smooth exponential cutoff at approximately 6.5 PeV. This framework reproduces all observed spectral features without invoking contributions from nearby sources or requiring non-standard assumptions about particle acceleration or propagation. Recent gamma-ray observations of supernova remnants, star-forming regions, and microquasars provide plausible astrophysical candidates for the origin of the two CR components.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-surface-brightness (LSB) structures serve as evidence of the intricate mass assembly of galaxies, and dedicatedly studying them promises to give us profound insights into the evolutionary history of galaxies. Furthermore, delving into the properties of star formation (SF) in the LSB regime can broaden our understanding of SF activity in regions characterized by low surface gas density, thereby shedding light on fundamental cosmic processes. However, systematic uncertainties may hamper the exploration of the LSB universe by limiting detectable SB levels. Indeed, despite dedicated advancements in telescope and observing techniques over decades, achieving ultra-deep photometric depths in optical wavelengths remains a formidable challenge. To overcome this challenge and explore the LSB universe that we have yet to see, we have been developing a novel telescope called K-DRIFT. This paper outlines the telescope's specification and describes various LSB features we aim for, explicitly focusing on nearby individual galaxies. To further advance the capabilities of the K-DRIFT survey, focused on LSB detection, we present several feasible research topics that utilize other survey data together and discuss the role of LSB observation in understanding the evolution of galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Two Deep Fields Imaging Survey (2DFIS), a wide-field imaging program conducted with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) targeting two astrophysically distinct regions: one containing a repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source and another hosting a candidate of a rotating galaxy cluster. Achieving a depth of r~26mag, the survey enables a search for faint optical counterparts and environmental signatures associated with the FRB, while high-quality photometric and galaxy shape measurements in the cluster field support a weak-lensing analysis of its mass distribution. This paper describes the observing strategy and data processing methodology adopted for 2DFIS, including the use of the LSST Science Pipelines with survey-specific adaptations for CFHT/MegaCam data. We outline a complete workflow for transforming raw CFHT exposures into science-ready data products, including calibrated single-epoch images, multi-band coadded mosaics, and extensive source catalogs. These data products provide the foundation for ongoing and future studies of FRB host environments, cluster mass reconstruction, and related cosmological applications.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectral analysis of two XMM-Newton observations of the high-mass X-ray binary system Cen X-3 is presented. In particular, it is focused on the eclipse and out-of-eclipse spectra in order to compare the properties of the environment around the compact object. The high-resolution spectra obtained from the reflection grating spectrometer on board XMM-Newton was analysed focusing on studying eclipse and out-of-eclipse spectra separately. Several continuum models were explored in SPEX for which we studied the properties of emitting and absorbing matter depending on the emission and absorption lines identified in the spectra. It was found that the X-ray continuum is heavily absorbed by a neutral gas and photoionised matter. Emission lines from Si v, Mg xii, Mg xi, and Ne x were detected in the eclipse spectrum. In particular, H-like lines of Mg and Ne with a significance greater than 5 sigma in the eclipse spectrum and 3 sigma in the out-of-eclipse spectrum. But in the out-of-eclipse spectrum any absorption lines, if any, were detected with a significance less than 2 sigma. RGS light curve showed dips in the out-of-eclipse spectrum which are not due to an increase in the column absorption but may be produced by instabilities in the accretion stream. On the other hand, the level of counts above 20 was compatible with the X-ray background. A simple local continuum model was used to describe the He-like triplet of Ne and the derived values of R and G ratio parameters pointed out that the UV photospheric field should be important at the line production site and an electron density greater than 10(12) cm-3. As a consequence, a hybrid plasma may be present in the binary system.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on very high-resolution resistive 2D and 3D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of current sheets, our findings suggest that the answer to this question is likely no. In contrast, turbulence-mediated reconnection yields significantly faster reconnection rates - about an order of magnitude higher than the so-called universal rate for plasmoid-mediated reconnection in MHD flows ($V_\text{rec}/V_A \sim 0.01$). We conclude that turbulence-driven reconnection is the dominant mechanism responsible for fast reconnection and flares in systems such as accretion flows and relativistic jets in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). In these environments, turbulence is driven by instabilities such as the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), Parker-Rayleigh-Taylor instability (PRTI), and current-driven kink instability (CDKI). Finally, we present 3D General Relativistic MHD simulations of accretion flows that confirm the crucial role of turbulence-mediated reconnection in AGN systems. These findings have important implications for understanding the origin of flares, particle acceleration, and the production of polarized radiation in these extreme environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability occurs in multiple heliospheric (solar-wind stream interfaces, planetary magnetospheres, cometary tails, heliopause flanks) and interstellar (protoplanetary disks, relativistic jets, neutron star accretion disks) environments. While the KH instability has been well-studied in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, only limited studies were performed in the collisionless regime, which is conducive to development of anisotropic pressures. Collisionless plasmas are often described using the Chew Goldberger and Low (CGL) equations which feature an anisotropic pressure tensor. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the CGL version of the KH instability using linearised and numerical techniques. We find that the largest growth rates and the greatest incidence of magnetic effects occur in the MHD limit. In the large relaxation time CGL limit, part of the energy goes into the formation of pressure anisotropies, resulting in smaller amounts of energy being available for bending the field lines. Consequently, when we cross-compare CGL and MHD simulations that are otherwise identical, the current densities are largest in the MHD limit, and the largest magnetic islands also form in that limit. Early and late time formation of pressure anisotropies have also been studied. We also find that the strongest trend for forming intermittencies in the flow also occurs in the MHD limit. The paper also discusses possible consequences of our results for turbulence and reconnection in the heliosheath (the layer between the solar wind termination shock and the heliopause).

 - **Abstract**
 We present Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) estimates of the physical properties and star formation efficiency (SFE) of molecular gas in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), using new $^{12}$CO $J=2\to1$ observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Combined with CHIMPS2 $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO $J=3\to2$, and SEDIGISM $^{13}$CO $J=2\to1$ data, we estimate a median excitation temperature of $T_{\rm ex} = 11$K for $^{13}$CO throughout the CMZ, with peaks exceeding $120$K in the Sgr B1/B2 complex. Cooler gas dominates around Sgr A and nearby clouds. We derive a median H$_{2}$ column-density of $N(\mathrm{H}2) = 2 \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a total $^{13}$CO-traced gas mass of $M_{\rm gas} = 7 \times 10^6$ M$_\odot$, consistent with previous estimates when accounting for spatial coverage. The instantaneous SFE is assessed using Hi-GAL compact sources detected at 70-$\mu m$ and 160--500-$\mu m$. The 70-$\mu m$-bright SFE, tracing current star formation, is modest overall but elevated in Sgr B1/B2, the Arches cluster, and Sgr C. In contrast, the 160--500-$\mu m$ SFE, tracing cold pre-stellar gas, is more broadly enhanced, particularly in the dust ridge clouds and towards negative longitudes surrounding Sgr C. The contrasting distributions suggest an evolutionary gradient in SFE, consistent with a transition from dense, cold gas to embedded protostars. Our results imply that the CMZ may be enter a more active phase of star formation, with large reservoirs of gas primed for future activity.

 - **Abstract**
 The black hole X-ray binary 4U 1755$-$338 underwent an outburst in 2020 after 25 years of quiescence. The comprehensive spectral analysis revealed that the system has a low interstellar neutral hydrogen column density of $0.34\pm0.01 \times$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. The outburst began with a low mass-accretion rate and was characterized as a low-luminosity outburst. The radius of the inner accretion disc remained constant throughout the outburst. Additionally, a growing neutral medium with constant density was detected in the local environment of 4U 1755$-$this http URL hardness-intensity diagram (HID) did not follow the standard q-shaped pattern, indicating a non-canonical outburst. Instead, the HID showed a correlated evolution of hardness and source flux, suggesting a thermal disc origin of the flux. A wideband spectral analysis was performed using simultaneous NICER-NuSTAR data in two frameworks, based on kerrbb and bhspec. The results of bhspec (kerrbb) based modeling indicate that 4U 1755$-$338 is a high-inclination system, $67.44_{-3.03}^{+9.75}$ ($75.25_{-4.68}^{+5.59}$) degrees, and harbors a moderately spinning black hole with a spin parameter of $0.78_{-0.14}^{+0.02}$ ($0.50_{-0.43}^{+0.19}$) and a mass of $3.37_{-1.04}^{+0.45} (3.28_{-1.1}^{+1.7})M_{\odot}$ respectively. The inferred key parameters: black hole mass, spin, and system inclination are consistent across both modeling approaches. No reflection features were detected in the spectra of 4U 1755$-$338. The high spectral index, the blackbody nature ($L\propto T^4$) of the hardness ratio, the absence of reflection signatures, and the weak variability in the power density spectra indicate that the source remained in the high/soft state throughout the outburst.
#### Is the nitrogen-rich source PN K4-47 a true planetary nebula?

 - **Abstract**
 PN K4-47 is a young planetary nebula that exhibits shock-excited bipolar lobes and a complex molecular environment, with the highest number of molecules detected within a planetary nebula. It has been questioned whether K4-47 is indeed a `typical' planetary nebula, or may be more exotic in nature. We examine this question using optical imaging and spectroscopy, and sub-millimetre and radio interferometry. Our observations spatially resolve the sub-millimetre environment of K4-47 for the first time. We find elongated CO (2-1) emission along a similar PA to the optical bipolar outflow. We derive a distance upper limit of 6 kpc to the source. The source hosts a fast ($\sim$350 km s$^{-1}$) bipolar optical outflow, and a slow (~50-60 km s$^{-1}$) molecular outflow along a similar PA. The outflow velocity indicates an age of 336 $\pm$ 119 yr. We also find that the excitation temperature and density of the atomic gas is~20 kK and 2800 cm$^{-3}$, respectively. The elemental and isotopic enrichment of K4-47 infers an AGB progenitor mass of 4-6 M$_{\odot}$, which corresponds to a white dwarf mass of ~1 M$_{\odot}$, following the initial-final mass relation for white dwarfs. We find that the core of K4-47 must contain 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ of dust to explain the extinction, and that photoionisation alone cannot explain the excitation of the atomic gas. We instead require an additional heating mechanism, with shocks a likely scenario. It is likely that the progenitor star of K4-47 was a J-type carbon AGB star, which formed the molecular and dusty circumstellar environment. The bipolar outflow is later triggered, punching through the circumstellar environment, producing shocks, and shaping the environment into the elongated structure seen in the sub-millimetre. We therefore classify K4-47 as a genuine, if unusual, planetary nebula.
