 - **Abstract**
 The thermal structures of highly irradiated ultra-hot Jupiters can deviate substantially from those of cooler hot Jupiters. For planets orbiting rapidly rotating, and consequently oblate, host stars, photometric light curves provide a unique opportunity to measure the spin-orbit angle. Moreover, in systems with significant spin-orbit misalignment, the stellar oblateness can induce observable orbital precession. We wish to study the atmosphere and orbital architecture of an ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-189 b, orbiting around a hot A-type star. We use the photometric phase curves and gravity-darkened transits of WASP-189 b observed with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), complemented with the archival observations from CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS). We detected a phase curve signal with significant occultation depth of 203.4 (+16.2) (-16.3) ppm, while the nightside flux, -71.8 (+36.4) (-36.0) ppm, is consistent with zero at 2-sigma. We invert the phase curve signal to construct the temperature map of the planet. The map was subsequently used to estimate the Bond albedo and heat redistribution efficiency, the expected median ranges of which are found to be 0.19-0.35 and 0.09-0.41, respectively. Finally, we analysed gravity-darkened transits to find that the planet is in polar orbit with the spin-orbit angle of 89.46 (+1.08) (-1.08) deg. We found no hint of orbital precession while comparing our results with those from the literature. Our observations, together with atmospheric modelling, suggest that the dayside emission of WASP-189 b in TESS and CHEOPS bandpasses is dominated by thermal emission from an atmosphere with extremely inefficient heat transport and negligible contribution from reflected light.

 - **Abstract**
 We use machine learning to measure the intracluster light (ICL) fractions of 177 galaxy groups and clusters identified from Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program imaging to explore how the ICL varies with the properties of its host cluster. We study the variation in ICL fraction with host cluster redshift, halo mass, and magnitude gap to investigate how the ICL develops over time, in various cluster environments, and with cluster relaxation. We find that there is a decreasing correlation with redshift (Spearman correlation $r_S=-0.604$, p-value $=9\times10^{-10}$), however this can be plausibly accounted for by including the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming and the passive aging of stellar populations. There is a weak negative correlation with halo mass ($r_S=-0.330$, p-value $=8\times 10^{-5}$) where ICL fractions are higher in lower halo mass groups than higher halo mass clusters. We also find that there is a marginal positive correlation with magnitude gap ($r_S=0.226$, p-value = 0.01), indicating that relaxed clusters are more likely to host higher ICL fractions. These results are consistent with a scenario where the dominant formation mechanism of the ICL is galaxy-galaxy interactions such as tidal stripping, and demonstrates the capability of the method to easily construct large samples and study large-scale trends in the ICL fraction.
#### Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and $ρ$ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU) I: A Planetary-Mass Companion and a Disk-Obscured Stellar Companion Discovered in Taurus

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first discoveries from Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and $\rho$ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU), an adaptive optics imaging survey of young stars in the Taurus and $\rho$ Oph star-forming regions using the Keck infrared pyramid wavefront sensor (PyWFS). We have found two faint ($\Delta$K~7 mag), wide-separation companions to two ~3-Myr-old Taurus members. Relative astrometry for these systems show that both companions are bound to their host stars. We obtained near-infrared spectra of these companions using IRTF/SpeX (R~100) and Gemini/GNIRS (R~1000-2000), and combine these with photometry from our NIRC2 imaging, the Pan-STARRS survey, and Spitzer/IRAC archival imaging to constrain their properties. One companion, KOINTREAU-1b (at a projected separation of 690 au), has an average near-IR spectral type of M9$\pm$2, a gravity classification of VL-G, and a changing spectral type between the SpeX (M7) and GNIRS (L1) observations. We estimate this object's mass to be $10.6^{+2.5}_{-2.3}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$, making KOINTREAU-1b the fifth planetary-mass companion found in Taurus. The other companion, KOINTREAU-2b (projected separation 560 au), has a spectral type of M4.5$\pm$1 but is ~4 magnitudes underluminous relative to other Taurus stars of the same spectral type. We detect exceptionally strong He I 1.083 micron emission from this object, indicative of outflows driven by ongoing accretion, but with a conspicuous lack of accompanying H emission. We conclude that KOINTREAU-2b is a young star obscured by an edge-on disk and observed in scattered light. Finally, we derive a distortion solution for NIRC2 imaging which shows a 0.118° difference in position angle from the previous distortion solution.

 - **Abstract**
 Rotating galaxies with relaxed gaseous disks have been discovered across cosmic time, from the local Universe to high redshift (z>4). But few such sources have been confirmed at z>4, making them a precious sample to examine what conditions result in such ordered kinematics in an early, more chaotic Universe. One of the best examples of this sample is the galaxy DLA0817g1 (z=4.2603), which shows remarkably clear rotation in ALMA [CII] data. We present recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (R~2700) of DLA0817g1, which we combine with archival ALMA [CII] observations to place constraints on its ISM conditions and morpho-kinematics. From a combination of line ratios, we find a high gas-phase metallicity (~0.7 solar), high fraction of obscured star formation, low ionisation (compared to other high-redshift galaxies observed with JWST), and no significant evidence for AGN (based on the WHAN diagnostic). Dynamical modelling with 3DBarolo reveal nearly identical rotation in Halpha and [CII], but with a higher velocity dispersion in the former. Using our metallicity estimate and previous CO and [CII] detections, we derive a new estimate of the molecular gas mass, relieving a previous strain in the mass budget. Altogether, we suggest that this is a 'smouldering' galaxy, where past star formation resulted in significant chemical enrichment (i.e., Zgas and Mdust), but the current activity is low (i.e., lower ionisation parameter and electron temperature). These new observations have opened a window into questions regarding the interplay of gas, metallicity, star formation, and kinematics in a prototypical early disk galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Extended main-sequence turnoffs are observed in the color-magnitude diagrams of some young and intermediate-age star clusters. Here we report the case study of NGC 3532. Among the cluster member candidates identified using the ML-MOC algorithm on Gaia DR3 sources, we found that fast rotators are significantly redder. Stars near the main-sequence turnoff exhibit a multi-modal distribution in the Gaia broadening velocity ($v_{\rm broad}$). A comparison with relevant literature suggests binaries being typically interspersed with fast rotators, often manifesting as slow to moderate rotators. Additionally, chemically peculiar stars are predominantly located in the bluer regions of the turnoff, with those in the fast-rotator region having large values of Gaia re-normalised unit weight error, indicating plausible companions. Our analysis suggests multiple channels responsible for angular momentum loss to account for the extended turnoff.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic microwave background absorption intensity in the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen in the presence of additional power in the form of a "bump" in the spectrum of cosmological density perturbations is calculated. The main absorption-amplifying effect is the earlier birth of the first stars forming an ultraviolet radiation background. This radiation reduces the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen and, thus, amplifies the absorption in the 21 cm line. A comparison of various cosmological models (with and without a bump in the density perturbation spectrum) shows that it is possible to determine the probable position of the bump in the perturbation spectrum and, thus, to reconstruct the spectrum of cosmological perturbations on scales $k>1$~Mpc${}^{-1}$ from the position of the absorption frequency profile.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive broadband spectral and variability study of the newly detected black hole X-ray binary Swift~J1727.8--1613 in the intermediate states during its 2023 outburst, using multi-mission observations from NICER, NuSTAR, AstroSat, and Insight-HXMT. The spectral data up to $78$ keV in the hard-intermediate state (HIMS) requires models with two Comptonizing regions. In contrast, models with a single Comptonizing region adequately describe the soft-intermediate states (SIMS), implying a significant evolution in the disk-corona geometry between the states. The hard X-ray tail above $100$ keV in the HIMS, detected with both AstroSat/CZTI and Insight-HXMT/HE, indicates that the electron population in the corona is not purely thermal but rather hybrid, with a power-law distribution above the thermal cutoff. While both the reflection modeling and disk continuum fitting favor a truncated disk geometry in the HIMS, the disk substantially moves close to the innermost stable circular orbit in the SIMS, accompanied by a significant rise in the disk temperature. This interpretation is further supported by the increase in the QPO frequency from $\sim1.3$ to $\sim6.6$ Hz. From joint modeling of the disk continuum and reflection component, we estimate a black hole mass of $10.5^{+7.7}_{-3.0}$, spin of $0.79^{+0.03}_{-0.13}$, and disk inclination angle of $42^\circ$-$50^\circ$, which match well with the previously reported spectro-polarimetric measurements. The inferred source distance of $\sim3.5$ kpc is consistent with the recent estimate based on optical spectroscopy. We find a weakly variable or stable disk and a highly variable Comptonized component.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar feedback, as a key process regulating the baryon cycle, is thought to greatly redistribute baryonic material inside and outside the dark matter halos (DMHs), however the observational evidences are lacking. Through stacking analyses of ~400,000 galaxy spectra from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we find star formation driven cool outflows in Mg II absorption line. Assuming only gravity acts on the launched gas, our calculations reveal that outflows from low mass galaxies (log M*<10) are capable of escaping beyond the DMHs, which aligns well with our finding in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) absorption along the minor-axes of galaxies using background quasars. This research offers indirect evidence that stellar feedback drives the low baryon retention rate in low-mass haloes, implicating that baryonic processes within galaxies are connected with the diffuse matter beyond the DMHs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 has exhibited prolific high-energy (HE) bursting activity in recent years. Investigating its potential tera-electronvolt counterpart could provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of magnetar emission and very high-energy (VHE) processes in extreme astrophysical environments. We aim to search for a possible tera-electronvolt counterpart to both its persistent and sub-second-scale burst emission. We analysed over 25 h of observations from the Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) during periods of HE activity from SGR 1935+2154 in 2021 and 2022 to search for persistent emission. For bursting emission, we selected and analysed nine 0.1 s time windows centred around known short X-ray bursts, targeting potential sub-second-scale tera-electronvolt counterparts in a low-photon-statistics regime. While no persistent or bursting emission was detected in our search, we establish upper limits for the tera-electronvolt emission of a short magnetar burst simultaneous to its soft gamma-ray flux. Specifically, for the brightest burst in our sample, the ratio between tera-electronvolt and X-ray flux is less than $10^{-3}$. The non-detection of either persistent or bursting tera-electronvolt emission from SGR 1935+2154 suggests that if such components exist, they may occur under specific conditions not covered by our observations. This aligns with theoretical predictions of VHE components in magnetar-powered fast radio bursts and the detection of MeV - GeV emission in giant magnetar flares. These findings underscore the potential of magnetars, fast radio bursts, and other fast transients as promising candidates for future observations in the low-photon-statistics regime with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, particularly with the CTAO.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization-mode observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are powerful tools for studying the dust grain populations in circumstellar disks. Many sources exhibit polarization signatures consistent with aligned dust grains, yet the physical origin of this alignment remains uncertain. One such source is BHB07-11, a Class I protobinary object in the Pipe Nebula with complex spiral arm structures in its circumbinary disk. While magnetic fields are often invoked to explain grain alignment in the interstellar medium, the contrasting conditions in circumstellar disk environments demand further investigation into grain alignment mechanisms. To determine BHB07-11's dominant polarization mechanism, we leverage ALMA polarization-mode dust continuum observations in Bands 3 ($\lambda$=3.1 mm), 6 ($\lambda$=1.3 mm), and 7 ($\lambda$=0.87 mm), in combination with high-resolution dust continuum and spectral line observations in Band 6. Observed polarization vectors in each band are consistent with emission from aligned grains and follow the structure of the spiral arms as shown in the high-resolution observations. Given the relationship between the observed polarization vector orientation and the spiral arms, we find that the polarization morphology is most consistent with grains aligned through a relative velocity flow between gas and dust in the spiral arms, as envisioned in the recently developed badminton birdie-like alignment mechanism, rather than alignment with a magnetic field or other known alignment mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Trajectories of test particles in a time-varying nonspherical gravitational potential model of our Galaxy are considered. The role of the quadrupole component of the potential, which at distances greater than 50 kpc is associated with the distribution of matter in the Galaxy's neighborhood (mainly with the influence of the galaxy M31), is studied. It is shown that perturbations of the potential created by the environment can significantly change the trajectories of particles at distances greater than 100 kpc from the Galactic center, but the magnitude of this effect depends on the still poorly known trajectory of the galaxy M31. For some variants of this trajectory, structures resembling a "thin plane" of satellite galaxies cannot exist for more than 2-3 billion years.

 - **Abstract**
 OB associations are primordial tracers of star formation and Galactic structure. Originally defined about 80 years ago, their historical membership lists have been superseded thanks to the precise astrometry from ESA's \textit{Gaia}'s satellite. Recent studies have however been mostly focused on individual OB associations or limited by the coverage of spectroscopic surveys. In this paper, we exploit a complete census of $\sim$25,000 O- and B-type stars within 1 kpc of the Sun to produce a highly-reliable catalogue of 57 OB associations using the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm, increasing the number of known OB associations by a factor of two within this volume. We assess the validity of this catalogue by crossmatching our OB association members with other catalogues of OB associations, star clusters and young stellar groups, confirming the high-confidence of our census of OB associations. We characterize these OB associations physically (total initial stellar mass, number of OB stars, ...) and kinematically (velocity dispersion, linear expansion ages, ...). Nearly three quarters of the OB associations (41 out of 57) exhibit a significant expansion pattern in at least one direction, including 13 in both plane-of-the-sky directions, though differences in expansion velocity suggest anisotropical expansion patterns. We compare the locations of these OB associations with superclouds and features in the local Milky Way such as the Radcliffe Wave and discuss the implications for star formation in the solar neighbourhood.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel graph-based machine learning classifier for identifying the dark matter cosmic web environments of galaxies. Large galaxy surveys offer comprehensive statistical views of how galaxy properties are shaped by large-scale structure, but this requires robust classifications of galaxies' cosmic web environments. Using stellar mass-selected IllustrisTNG-300 galaxies, we apply a three-stage, simulation-based framework to link galaxies to the total (mainly dark) underlying matter distribution. Here, we apply the following three steps: First, we assign the positions of simulated galaxies to a void, wall, filament, or cluster environment using the T-Web classification of the underlying matter distribution. Second, we construct a Delaunay triangulation of the galaxy distribution to summarise the local geometric structure with ten graph metrics for each galaxy. Third, we train a graph attention network (GAT) on each galaxy's graph metrics to predict its cosmic web environment. For galaxies with stellar mass $\mathrm{>10^9 M_{\odot}}$, our GAT+ model achieves an accuracy of $85\,\%$, outperforming graph-agnostic multilayer perceptrons and graph convolutional networks. Our results demonstrate that graph-based representations of galaxy positions provide a powerful and physically meaningful way to infer dark matter environments. We plan to apply this simulation-based graph modelling to investigate how the properties of observed galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey are influenced by their dark matter environments.
#### Transformation of orientation and rotation angles of synchronous satellites: Application to the Galilean moons

 - **Abstract**
 The orientation and rotation of a synchronous satellite can be referred to both its Laplace plane and the ICRF equatorial plane, in terms of Euler angles or spin axis Cartesian coordinates and Earth equatorial coordinates, respectively. We computed second-order analytical expressions to make the transformation between the two systems and applied them to the Galilean satellites (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto). If one term of the spin axis Cartesian coordinates series is dominant, trigonometric series can be generated for the inertial and orbital obliquities, node longitude and offset with respect to the Cassini plane. Since the transformation does not require any fit of amplitudes and frequencies on numerical series, the physical meaning of the frequencies is preserved from the input series and the amplitudes can be directly related to the geophysical parameters of interest. We provide tables for the coordinates and angles' series assuming that the satellites are entirely solid, and considering two different orbital theories. The possible amplitude ranges for the main terms are also examined in the case where a liquid layer is assumed in the interior model. We use our transformation method to propose an updated IAU WG solution which would result in an improvement with respect to zero obliquity models used so far. This method will also be useful for the interpretation of future Earth-based radar observations or JUICE data.
