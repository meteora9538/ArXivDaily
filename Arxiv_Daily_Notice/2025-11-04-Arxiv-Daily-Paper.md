 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf galaxies are dark matter-dominated systems that are sensitive to feedback and display a diversity of baryonic morphologies. This makes them excellent probes for understanding dark matter and galaxy evolution. This work investigates the physical processes that influence the sizes of isolated dwarf galaxies using high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of $39$ dwarf galaxies drawn from the Marvelous Massive Dwarfs simulation suite ($7.5 < \log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) < 9.1$). Our simulations show that dwarf galaxies initially form as compact galaxies ($R_e < 2$ kpc). However, several of these galaxies ($54\%$) experience periods of gradual size growth at relatively stable sSFR, allowing them to become extended galaxies. We find that the growth of rotation-supported stellar disks is the primary means by which isolated dwarfs become extended in size. These stellar disks are formed by mergers with high orbital angular momentum satellites on high angular momentum (spiraling-in) orbits, which spin up the gas surrounding the central galaxy and contribute $\approx 30 \%$ of the cold gas mass at $z=0$. For these systems, star formation in the angular momentum supported gas and the gradual build up of stars in the disk result in secular size growth.
#### Saving Doomed Planets: Mass Loss and Angular Momentum Return Boost Hot Jupiter Survival Rates

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of giant extrasolar planets on short-period orbits ("hot Jupiters") represents a challenge to theories of planet formation. A leading explanation invokes perturbations from distant companions, i.e., the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism, which can excite the eccentricities of initially wide-orbiting planets to values of order unity. The resulting tidal dissipation at periastron shrinks and circularizes the orbits to their observed configurations. While observations of orbital misalignment and distant companions support this scenario, theoretical models have struggled to reproduce the observed hot Jupiter occurrence rate. Population synthesis studies often predict that many source "cold Jupiters" are destroyed by tidal disruption during highly eccentric passages. We revisit this question with improved treatments of the mass loss and angular momentum return experienced by tidally perturbed planets. Numerical studies are performed by combining secular dynamical evolution with planetary structural evolution using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). We also use an analytical approach to estimate rates of tidal disruption and hot Jupiter survival. Our new population synthesis studies of giant planets in stellar binaries show that improved treatment of tidal mass loss enhances hot Jupiter survival by a factor of $\sim2-3$, yielding occurrence rates ($\gtrsim 0.5\%$ around FGK stars) consistent with observations. Angular momentum return from mass accreted onto the star may also produce a pileup of hot Jupiters near three-day orbital periods that is in statistical agreement with observations. These results suggest that EKL-driven high-eccentricity migration, when combined with realistic planetary mass loss, may be a dominant channel for hot Jupiter formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutral-oxygen [OI] far-infrared emission lines at $63\mu$m and $145\mu$m are powerful probes of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium, although they have not been fully exploited in high-redshift studies. We investigate the connection between [OI] emission lines and key galaxy properties, such as star formation rate (SFR) and H$_2$ content. Our predictions are compared with existing observations and new data analysed in this work. We post-process the outputs of the ColdSIM cosmological simulations with the DESPOTIC model, taking into account [OI]$63\mu$m self-absorption by cold foreground material. A Random Forest algorithm is employed to accelerate computations and new observational ALMA data for galaxies at redshift $z\simeq 5-7$ are used to validate our model. Our predictions show significant [OI]$63\mu$m luminosities ($\approx 10^8\,\rm L_\odot$) for galaxies with SFRs of $\approx 10^2\,\rm M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The $145\mu$m line luminosity is typically $15 \%$ the [OI]$63\mu$m one and is a factor $\approx 2-20$ below high-$z$ observations. Both [OI] lines correlate with SFR and molecular mass, but exhibit flattening in scaling relations with metallicity and stellar mass. Foreground self-absorption reduces the [OI] flux by a factor of $2-4$, consistent with empirical corrections in observational studies. We find typical line ratios of [OI]$63\mu$m / [CII]$158\mu$m $\approx 1$ and [OI]$145\mu$m / [CII]$158\mu$m $ \approx 0.2 \, -$ consistent with $z\gtrsim 6$ observations, but only when [OI]$63\mu$m self-absorption is included. Both [OI]$63\mu$m and [OI]$145\mu$m lines serve as tracers of star formation and molecular gas at high redshift. Their joint detection can provide constraints on the properties of the early interstellar medium and self-absorption of the [OI]$63\mu$m line.
#### Connecting Star Formation in the Milky Way and Nearby Galaxies. I. Comparability of Molecular Cloud Physical Properties

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26976

 - **Abstract**
 We used CO (2-1) and CO (1-0) data cubes to identify molecular clouds and study their kinematics and dynamics in three nearby galaxies and the inner Milky Way. When observed at similar spatial and velocity resolutions, molecular clouds in the same mass range across these galaxies show broadly comparable physical properties and similar star formation rates (SFRs). However, this comparability depends on smoothing Milky Way clouds to match the resolution of the extragalactic observations. The beam effect can artificially inflate cloud sizes, leading to inaccurate estimates of radius, density, and virial parameters. By comparing high-resolution and smoothed Milky Way data, we established criteria to exclude beam-affected clouds in the extragalactic sample. After applying this filter, cloud properties remain consistent across galaxies, though some clouds in NGC 5236 show elevated velocity dispersions, likely due to environmental effects. In the inner Milky Way, molecular clouds fall into two groups: those with clumps and those without. Clump-associated clouds are more massive, denser, have higher velocity dispersions, lower virial parameters, and stronger 8~\(\mu\)m emission, suggesting more intense feedback. Strong correlations are found between cloud mass and total clump mass, clump number, and the mass of the most massive clump. These results suggest that a cloud's physical conditions regulate its internal clump properties and, in turn, its star-forming potential.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a sample of 127 gas-bearing dwarf galaxies around 56 late-type host galaxies within 30 Mpc using 21-cm HI data from the WALLABY, MHONGOOSE, and ALFALFA surveys. We characterize the environment of each dwarf galaxy based on its host galaxy halo and derive optical properties using the DESI Legacy Surveys for 110. The gaseous satellites span $\log (M_{\rm HI}/M_{\odot}) = 5.7-9.7$ and $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) = 5.6-10.0$, with a median velocity line-width of $W_{50}=37$ km/s, comparable to the Local Group gaseous dwarf galaxies. We assess the HI mass sensitivity of the data by injecting model dwarf galaxies and find $M_{\rm HI,lim} = 10^{6.7} M_{\odot}$ for WALLABY and $M_{\rm HI,lim} = 10^{5.4} M_{\odot}$ for MHONGOOSE at 10 Mpc. With this sensitivity, our sample shows lower average gas-to-stellar mass ratios ($M_{\rm HI}/M_{\star}$) than literature dwarf galaxy samples. The abundance of gaseous satellites per host is low and increases with host mass: $0-2$ for isolated dwarf galaxy hosts and $0-5$ for Milky Way-mass spiral hosts. These numbers are consistent with the Milky Way, M31, and star-forming satellite abundances from recent deep optical surveys. The inferred quenched fractions and gas-depleted satellites indicate that environmental quenching is effective in Milky Way-mass hosts, likely driven by gas stripping processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave detectors can probe the existence of dark matter with exquisite sensitivity. Here, we perform a search for three kinds of dark matter -- dilatons (spin-0), dark photons (spin-1) and tensor bosons (spin-2) -- using three independent methods on the first part of the most recent data from the fourth observing run of LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA. Each form of dark matter could have interacted with different standard-model particles in the instruments, causing unique differential strains on the interferometers. While we do not find any evidence for a signal, we place the most stringent upper limits to-date on each of these models. For scalars with masses between $[4\times 10^{-14},1.5\times 10^{-13}]$ eV that couple to photons or electrons, our constraints improve upon those from the third observing run by one order of magnitude, with the tightest limit of $\sim 10^{-20}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ at a mass of $\sim2\times 10^{-13}\text{ eV}$. For vectors with masses between $[7\times 10^{-13},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV that couple to baryons, our constraints supersede those from MICROSCOPE and Eöt-Wash by one to two orders of magnitude, reaching a minimum of $\sim 5\times 10^{-24}$ at a mass of $\sim 10^{-12}$ eV. For tensors with masses of $[4\times 10^{-14},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV (the full mass range analyzed) that couple via a Yukawa interaction, our constraints surpass those from fifth-force experiments by four to five orders of magnitude, achieving a limit as low as $\sim 8\times 10^{-9}$ at $\sim2\times 10^{-13}$ eV. Our results show that gravitational-wave interferometers have become frontiers for new physics and laboratories for direct multi-model dark-matter detection.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze JWST NIRISS and NIRSpec spectroscopic observations in the Abell 2744 galaxy cluster field. From approximately 120 candidates, we identify 12 objects with at least a prominent emission lines among \Oii, \Hb, \Oiiia, \Oiiib, and \Ha that are spectroscopically confirmed by both instruments. Our key findings reveal systematic differences between the two spectrographs based on source morphology and shutter aperture placement. Compact objects show comparable or higher integrated flux in NIRSpec relative to NIRISS (within 1$\sigma$ uncertainties), while extended sources consistently display higher flux in NIRISS measurements. This pattern reflects NIRSpec's optimal coverage for compact objects while potentially undersampling extended sources. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that NIRSpec recovers at least $63\%$ of NIRISS-measured flux when the slit covers $>15\%$ of the source or when $R_e<1$kpc. For lower coverage or larger effective radii, the recovered flux varies from $24\%$ to $63\%$. When studying the \Ha/\Oiiib emission line ratio, we observe that measurements from these different spectrographs can vary by up to $\sim$0.3 dex, with significant implications for metallicity and star formation rate characterizations for individual galaxies. These results highlight the importance of considering instrumental effects when combining multi-instrument spectroscopic data and demonstrate that source morphology critically influences flux recovery between slit-based and slitless spectroscopic modes in JWST observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Nanophase metallic iron ( $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ ) is a key indicator of space weathering on the lunar surface, primarily attributed to solar wind irradiation and micrometeoroid impacts. Recent discoveries of hematite ( $\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{O}_3$ ), a highly oxidized form of iron, in the lunar polar regions challenge the prevailing understanding of the Moon's reducing environment. This study, using ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations of micrometeoroid impacts on fayalite ( $\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{SiO}_4$ ), investigates the atomistic mechanisms leading to both reduced and oxidized iron species. Our simulations reveals that the high-temperature and pressure conditions at the impact crater surface produces a reduced iron environment while providing a transient oxygen-rich environment in the expanding plume. Our findings bridge previously disparate observations-linking impact-driven $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ formation to the puzzling presence of oxidized iron phases on the Moon, completing the observed strong dichotomous distribution of hematite between the nearside and farside of the Moon. These findings highlight that micrometeoroid impacts, by simultaneously generating spatially distinct redox environments, provide a formation mechanism that reconciles the ubiquitous identification of nanophase metallic iron ( $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ ) in returned lunar samples with $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ signatures detected by remote sensing. This underscores the dynamic nature of space weathering processes. For a more nuanced understanding of regolith evolution, we should also consider the presence of different generations or types of $\mathrm{npFe}{ }^0$, such as those formed from solar wind reduction versus impact disproportionation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Hyper Millennium (HM) simulation, an extremely large cosmological simulation designed to support next-generation galaxy surveys. The simulation follows 4.2 trillion dark matter particles in a comoving box of $2.5\ h^{-1}{\rm Gpc}$, with a mass resolution of $3.2 \times 10^8\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$ and a force resolution of $3.0\ h^{-1}{\rm kpc}$. Its combination of scale and resolution is ideal for studying large-scale structures and rare cosmic objects. In this first paper of the HM project, we explore whether the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 (A2744) can be reproduced in detail in the simulation. Pixel-based statistics of galaxy number density $N_{\rm gal}$, luminosity density $L_{\rm gal}$, and projected mass density $\kappa$ show excellent agreement between A2744 and its analogues down to $\sim 50\ {\rm kpc}$, once field-selection biases toward high galaxy surface density are accounted for. This concordance, achieved in one of the most extreme known galaxy environments, is a validation of the underlying $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model in the extreme regime of A2744 and showcases the robustness and accuracy of the HM simulation, which is capable of producing galaxy and mass catalogues of comparable quality out to high redshift across its full comoving volume of $45$ ${\rm Gpc^3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a systematic statistical study of ultra-diffuse galaxy analogues (NUDGEs) in a large sample of galaxy clusters to investigate their properties with respect to the host clusters. We used data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program wide field survey and find a total of 5057 NUDGEs exceeding the background counts in 51 out of 66 galaxy clusters. The clusters span the redshift range 0.08$\,<\,$z$\,<\,$0.15 and they have a mass range of $0.95\times10^{14}\,\text{M}_\odot - 8.34\times10^{14}\,\text{M}_\odot$. The properties of these NUDGEs are found to be similar to UDGs studied in previous works and reaffirm that they are an extension of a continuous galaxy distribution. The number of NUDGEs as a function of cluster halo mass for our sample follows the power law: $N\propto M_{200}^{0.78\pm\,0.28} $. This fit is consistent with previous UDG studies and, together with our NUDGE sizes distributions, matches well with the simulations of UDGs in cored dark matter haloes formed by tidal stripping. The NUDGE density distribution with respect to clustercentric radius of our sample is flatter than previous UDG studies, although the red NUDGEs in this sample show a statistically significant decrease in density with respect to clustercentric radius, indicating that red UDGs may be more affected by their environment than blue UDGs.
#### Multi-band infrared imaging reveals dusty spiral arcs around the binary B[e] star 3 Puppis

 - **Abstract**
 3 Puppis is the brightest known B[e] star. Recent work classifies this A-type object as a supergiant, yet the impact of its binarity on the circumstellar environment (CE) remains hard to characterize. To resolve its dusty region at 5-10 mas, we obtained mid-IR interferometric observations with VLTI/MATISSE over 3-12 {\mu}m. Because the (u,v) coverage supports imaging, we introduce a statistical interferometric-imaging workflow based on MiRA to generate averaged images: this systematic approach enables the selection of an optimal set of reconstructions, improving the robustness and fidelity of the recovered features. We also use SPARCO, an independent tool well suited to bright central objects embedded in fainter extended emission. Images from both tools in the L, M, and N bands agree and reveal an asymmetric, elongated feature ~17 mas (~10 au at 631 pc) southeast of the star with ~20% density contrast. A second northwest asymmetry and a skewed inner rim are detected. Simple geometric modelling, guided by the MATISSE images, constrains the morphology, location, and flux of the CE and its asymmetries. The images are consistent with earlier VLTI measurements but expose a more complex CE with large-scale clumps in the southeast and northwest parts of the disc. Hydrodynamic modelling indicates that tidal spiral-wake perturbations from the central binary, dynamically excited at Lindblad resonances in the circumbinary disc, best explain the radial extent and curvature of the elongated structures seen in all bands.
#### DiffstarPop: A generative physical model of galaxy star formation history

 - **Abstract**
 We present DiffstarPop, a differentiable forward model of cosmological populations of galaxy star formation histories (SFH). In the model, individual galaxy SFH is parametrized by Diffstar, which has parameters $\theta_{\rm SFH}$ that have a direct interpretation in terms of galaxy formation physics, such as star formation efficiency and quenching. DiffstarPop is a model for the statistical connection between $\theta_{\rm SFH}$ and the mass assembly history (MAH) of dark matter halos. We have formulated DiffstarPop to have the minimal flexibility needed to accurately reproduce the statistical distributions of galaxy SFH predicted by a diverse range of simulations, including the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation, the Galacticus semi-analytic model, and the UniverseMachine semi-empirical model. Our publicly available code written in JAX includes Monte Carlo generators that supply statistical samples of galaxy assembly histories that mimic the populations seen in each simulation, and can generate SFHs for $10^6$ galaxies in 1.1 CPU-seconds, or 0.03 GPU-seconds. We conclude the paper with a discussion of applications of DiffstarPop, which we are using to generate catalogs of synthetic galaxies populating the merger trees in cosmological N-body simulations.
