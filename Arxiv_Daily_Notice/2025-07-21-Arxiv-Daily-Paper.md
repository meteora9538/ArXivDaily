 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed the deepest Hubble Space Telescope (HST) F275W ultraviolet (UV) imaging of M87 to obtain the most robust constraints on its star formation rate (SFR) and star formation history (SFH). After removing the galaxy continuum and globular clusters, we detected an excess of UV point sources near the center. By comparing their colors to young stellar source (YSS) colors generated by stochastically simulated star formation (SF) for various SFRs and SFHs, we ruled out their origin as a UV-upturn population and identified them as YSS. We found an extremely low SFR of $\sim 2\times10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in M87, with evidence of a weak starburst $\sim$125 Myr ago that formed $\sim 1000$ M$_\odot$ of stars. Unlike other cool-core clusters where SF is stronger and directly linked to cooling gas, we found no spatial correlation between YSS and H$\alpha$ filaments. Comparing SF activity with M87's AGN outburst history suggests that recent AGN feedback events ($\lesssim$12 Myr ago) neither triggered nor were associated with any detectable SF, however, earlier outbursts may have triggered weak starbursts. We detected UV filaments co-spatial with H$\alpha$ filaments with similar lengths and widths, though they are obscured by dust near the center. These filaments are likely powered by metal-line emission from collisional ionization, suggesting ongoing low-level precipitation of the intracluster medium. Our results indicate that AGN feedback has quenched SF significantly in M87 for at least 200 Myr, even though some precipitation persists. Additionally, we identified a hotspot created by the counterjet, with the spectral index also constrained.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we explore the properties of diffuse intergalactic gas residing in the outskirts of the four nearby, low-mass galaxy groups NGC1052, NGC5866, NGC4631, and NGC3992 (all at cz<2000 km/s) beyond their group virial radii. Using archival ultraviolet absorption spectra of bright AGN observed with HST/COS, we search for HI Ly a absorption near the groups' recession velocities along 35 sightlines that pass the outer group medium (OGrM) at normalized impact parameters rho/Rvir=1-3. We derive HI column densities of the absorbers and constrain the physical conditions in the gas by using a hydrostatic toy model of the groups' gas environment and assuming photoionization. HI Ly absorption near the groups' recession velocities is detected along 19 sightlines with HI column densities in the range log N(HI)=12.50-14.34, implying a high OGrM detection rate of more than 50 percent. We transform this value into an incidence rate of OGrM absorbers per unit redshift of dN/dz=this http URL is 25 percent above the value derived for the general population of Ly a absorbers within z = 0 filaments and more than twice the value for the z = 0 Ly a forest. From the modeling, we obtain lower limits for the gas densities from log n_H=-5.00 to -3.72, comparable to densities found in the overall Ly a forest. Our study unveils a large cross section and overdensity of Ly a absorbers in the outskirts of these four nearby groups. Such an overdensity is in line with a previously proposed scenario, in which AGN feedback lifts gaseous material to large distances beyond the virial radius of groups into the OGrM. However, a larger survey of OGrM absorbers and a comparison with hydrodynamical simulations will be necessary to constrain the cosmological mass density of OGrM absorbers and pinpoint their role in cosmological structure formation and galaxy/group evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical simulations have become an indispensable tool in astrophysics. To interpret their results, it is critical to understand their intrinsic variability, that is, how much the results change with numerical noise or inherent stochasticity of the physics model. We present a set of seven realisations of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy with the Auriga galaxy formation model. All realisations share the same initial conditions and code parameters, but draw different random numbers for the inherently stochastic parts of the model. We show that global galaxy properties at $z=0$, including stellar mass, star formation history, masses of stellar bulge and stellar disc, the radius and height of the stellar disk change by less than $10\%$ between the different realisations, and that magnetic field structures in the disc and the halo are very similar. In contrast, the star formation rate today can vary by a factor of two and the internal morphological structure of the stellar disc can change. The time and orbit of satellite galaxies and their galaxy properties when falling into the main halo are again very similar, but their orbits start to deviate after first pericenter passage. Finally, we show that changing the mass resolution of all matter components in the Auriga model changes galaxy properties significantly more than the intrinsic variability of the model, and that these changes are systematic. This limits detailed comparisons between simulations at different numerical resolutions.

 - **Abstract**
 Most general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black hole (BH) hot accretion flows are initialized with small rotating tori and produce stable jets with only small fluctuations. However, recent studies using larger scale Bondi-like initial conditions have reported intermittent jet activity and loss of coherent rotation. To investigate the differences, we modify the standard torus setup across four BH spins: $a_*=0$, $0.5$, $0.9$, $-0.9$. First, we increase the torus size significantly (pressure maximum at 500 gravitational radii), allowing long simulations ($2.8\times10^5$ gravitational times) without gas depletion. These runs reproduce the weak variability seen in smaller tori, indicating that a larger dynamic range alone does not cause strong fluctuations. We observe moderate suppression of the accretion rate by factors of $\sim 1.6, ~2.5$ for BH spins $a_*=0.5,~0.9$, respectively, compared to $a_*=0$. Also, the density profile scales as $\rho(r)\propto r^{-1.1}$ for prograde BHs. Next, we considerably strengthen the initial magnetic field in the large torus by setting the plasma-$\beta\approx 1$. This induces strong variability in the evolution. The jet efficiency in the $a_*=0.9$ model, for instance, now varies by over 3 orders of magnitude, and gas rotation reverses directions. Combining these results with prior studies, we propose that a key parameter is the ratio $R$ between the rotational and magnetic energies in the initial state. Strong variability appears later in models with a larger value of $R$. The implication is that all simulations, and by extension all hot accretion flows in Nature, will ultimately develop intermittent jets if evolved long enough.
#### Unveiling M33's Hidden Merger History: A Potential Population of Star Clusters on Retrograde Orbits

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a possible sub-population of stellar clusters that appear to follow retrograde orbits around the third largest galaxy in the Local Group, M33 (Triangulum). This spiral disk galaxy has apparently had a mostly quiescent existence, although recent discoveries, particularly of a pronounced warp in the gas and stellar disk, suggest that M33's relatively quiet past was interrupted at least once by a dynamical interaction with another galaxy. We suggest that this sub population provides evidence of accretion of one or more dwarf galaxies in M33's history. We estimate a lower limit for the accreted halo virial mass of $M_{\rm vir} \sim (7 \pm 3) \times 10^{10}$\msun, accounting for about 10\% of the virial mass in the halo of M33 that has an accretion origin. We propose one of these accretion events as the source of the observed warp in M33's disk.
#### The $z=7.08$ quasar ULAS J1120+0641 May Never Reach a "Normal" Black Hole to Stellar Mass Ratio

 - **Abstract**
 JWST observations of quasars in the Epoch of Reionization have revealed that many lie in host galaxies that are severely undermassive relative to the supermassive black holes. It is unclear how these systems will evolve to the tight local relation between stellar mass and black hole mass. We search for companions around the z=7.08 quasar ULAS J1120+0641 using JWST/NIRCam narrow, medium, and wide-band photometry to identify [O III] emitters at the quasar redshift, and explore the potential for growth of the host galaxy through future mergers. We find 22 sources near the quasar's redshift across our two 4.4 arcmin$^2$ fields, indicating that environment of ULAS J1120+0641 is strongly overdense in z~7.1 galaxies relative to the field. We estimate the potential future mass budget of the quasar host galaxy by summing the current stellar and gas masses of the quasar host and surrounding galaxies, correcting for incompleteness and selection effects. With no further black hole growth, ULAS J1120+0641 is unlikely to reach a $M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_*$ ratio less than ~2.5% at z=0, still much higher than typical for local galaxies. However, such systems -- a quiescent black hole in a low-luminosity galaxy -- may have escaped detection locally if they are sufficiently distant.

 - **Abstract**
 We present early results from a high-resolution analysis ($\sim$100-200pc) of the CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) line ratio in twelve nearby galaxies. We use new ALMA CO(1-0) observations from the Fundamental CO(1-0) Transition Survey (FACTS), and re-imaged CO(2-1) data from PHANGS. We make empirical classifications based on the optical and molecular gas morphologies, which show clear systematic trends in the variation of $R_{21}$ as a function of galactic structure. The sample includes barred and unbarred, and flocculent galaxies. The barred spiral galaxies follow a general trend: $R_{21}$ is high in the center, low along the bar, increases at the bar ends, and then declines in the outer parts of the disk. The structure dependence suggests the importance of galactic dynamics on molecular gas evolution, and consequently on star formation, in galaxies. $R_{21}$ fluctuates in the spiral arms for both barred and unbarred galaxies. HII regions increase $R_{21}$ locally in their surrounding gas and are often associated with galactic structures. Together, $R_{21}$ varies systematically as a function of galactic structure, dynamics, and star formation activity.
#### Evolutionary Period Changes for 25 X-ray Binaries and the Measurement of an Empirical Universal Law for Angular Momentum Loss in Accreting Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 I measure and collect timings of phase markers (like eclipse times) for the orbits of 25 X-ray binaries (XRBs) so as to calculate the steady evolutionary period change ($\dot{P}$). I combine these with my observed $\dot{P}$ measures from 52 cataclysmic variables (CVs). Further, I subtract out the contributions from gravitational radiation ($\dot{P}_{\rm GR}$) and mass transfer ($\dot{P}_{\rm mt}$), deriving the period change from the residual unknown angular momentum loss ($\dot{P}_{\rm AML}$=$\dot{P}$-$\dot{P}_{\rm GR}$-$\dot{P}_{\rm mt}$). I have $\dot{P}_{\rm AML}$ measures for 77 XRBs and CVs, with these being direct measures of the driver of binary evolution. The venerable Magnetic Braking Model (MBM) of binary evolution has its most fundamental predictions tested, with most systems having predictions wrong by over one order-of-magnitude. Other proposed mechanisms to explain the AML also fail, so we are left with no known mechanism that dominates the AML. An alternative path to the AML law is empirical, where my $\dot{P}_{\rm AML}$ measures are fitted to a power-law involving the fundamental binary properties. With this, the dominant AML law for systems with orbital periods ($P$) from 0.13--1.0 days is $\dot{P}_{\rm AML} = -1500\times10^{-12} P^{1.29} M_{\rm prim}^{2.75} M_{\rm comp}^{-1.00}\dot{M}^{0.43}_{-8}$, in appropriate units. Similar AML laws for binaries below the Period Gap and for binaries with $P$$>$1.0 day are derived. These three AML laws are of good accuracy and are the best representations of the actual evolution for all 77 XRBs and CVs of all classes, so the three taken together can be called `universal'.
#### VLT/ERIS observations of the V960 Mon system: a dust-embedded substellar object formed by gravitational instability?

 - **Abstract**
 V960~Mon is an FU Orionis object that shows strong evidence of a gravitationally unstable spiral arm that is fragmenting into several dust clumps. We report the discovery of a new substellar companion candidate around this young star, identified in high-contrast $L'$-band imaging with VLT/ERIS. The object is detected at a projected separation of $0.898 \pm 0.01$ arcseconds with a contrast of $(8.39 \pm 0.07) \times 10^{-3}$. The candidate lies close to the clumps previously detected in the sub-mm (at 1.3 mm) and is co-located with extended polarized IR signal from scattered stellar irradiation, suggesting it is deeply embedded. The object is undetected in the SPHERE $H$-band total intensity, placing an upper mass limit of $\sim38~M_\mathrm{Jup}$ from the contrast curve. Using evolutionary models at an assumed age of 1~Myr, we estimate a mass of $\sim660~M_\mathrm{Jup}$ from the L' brightness; however, this value likely includes a significant contribution from a disk around the companion. The discrepancy between near- and mid-infrared results again suggests the source is deeply embedded in dust. This candidate may represent an actively accreting, disk-bearing substellar object in a young, gravitationally unstable environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are traditionally classified into long (lGRBs) and short (sGRBs) durations based on their $T_{90}$, with lGRBs widely used as tracers of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) due to their observed association with core-collapse supernovae. However, recent detections of kilonovae accompanying some lGRBs challenge this assumption, suggesting potential contamination from compact binary mergers. Here, we move beyond the conventional $T_{90}$-based classification and focus exclusively on GRBs directly associated with supernovae - the most direct signatures of massive stellar collapse - to reassess their connection to the SFR. Using a sample of SN/GRBs, we construct the luminosity - redshift ($L$-$z$) plane and uncover a significant correlation between these variables. To account for observational biases, we apply the $\tau$ statistic and Lynden-Bell's $C^{-}$ method to derive the intrinsic luminosity function and formation rate. Our analysis reveals that even among this well-defined subsample, the SN/GRB formation rate still exceeds the SFR at low redshifts ($z < 1$). These findings suggest that GRBs at low redshift may not serve as reliable tracers of the SFR, and that larger samples are required to further investigate this discrepancy.
#### Magnetically Driven Retrograde Precession in Misaligned Black Hole Accretion Flows

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of accreting black hole (BH) systems, such as microquasars and supermassive black holes, often reveal a precessing jet with changing directions, indicating a misaligned accretion flow relative to the BH spin. The precession is commonly attributed to the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect, which arises from the BH's rotation twisting the surrounding spacetime and accretion flow. In the strongly magnetized regime, which is preferred accretion flow conditions for M~87$^*$ and likely other jet-producing systems, the large-scale magnetic field can significantly influence the flow dynamics. Here, we perform large-scale three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of tilted accretion onto a rotating BH, and find a never-seen-before new retrograde precession. This precession arises from a magnetic torque on the disk generated by the poloidal magnetic field aligned with the BH's rotation, opposing the LT torque. This finding highlights the unique property of highly magnetized accretion flows around BHs and provides a new interpretation of jet precession observed in many systems.
#### An integral field spectroscopic study of stellar and ionized gas properties around edge-on disk galaxies in the stellar mass range 9<log M*<11

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the stellar light, 4000 Angstrom break and emission line profiles of 82 edge-on disk galaxies from the MaNGA survey. We characterize the stellar light profiles perpendicular to the disk plane using two parameters: a) the power law slope of the thick disk component, 2) the transition radius where the profile flattens. The 4000 Angstrom break profiles perpendicular to the plane are characterized by the number of significant changes in slope (breaks) and by the change in D_n(4000) from inner to outer disk. The slope correlates tightly with the stellar mass of the galaxy over the stellar mass range 10^9<log M*<10^10 M_sun. More massive galaxies have more extended thick disks. The slope and transition radius exhibit large scatter for galaxies more massive than 10^{10} M_sun. Half the sample have older stellar populations in their thick disks, a third have flat D$_n$(4000) profiles and 15% have younger thick disks. The D$_n$(4000) profiles exhibit as many as 4 separate breaks. There are more breaks in massive galaxies with bulges and more extended thick disks. This may indicate that the breaks are produced by more frequent accretion events in such systems. The extra-planar Halpha EQW correlates most strongly with the specific star formation rate of the galaxy, and the [OII]/Halpha ratio increases with distance from the disk plane. This increase is most apparent for massive galaxies with extended thick disk components and low SFR/M* These findings support the hypothesis that the larger [OII]/Halpha ratios may be caused by ionization from evolved stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are spun up during their accretion phase in a binary system. The exchange of angular momentum between the accretion disk and the star tends to align the spin and orbital angular momenta on a very short time scale compared to the accretion stage. In this work, we study a subset of $\gamma$-ray MSPs in binaries for which the orbital inclination $i$ has been accurately constrained thanks to the Shapiro delay measurements. Our goal is to constrain the observer viewing angle $\zeta$ and to check whether it agrees with the orbital inclination $i$, thus $\zeta \approx i$. We use a Bayesian inference technique to fit the MSP $\gamma$-ray light-curves based on the third $\gamma$-ray pulsar catalogue (3PC). The emission model relies on the striped wind model deduced from force-free neutron star magnetosphere simulations. We found good agreement between those two angles ($i$ and $\zeta$) for a significant fraction of our sample, between 1/2 and 2/3, confirming the spin-orbit alignment scenario during the accretion stage. However about one third of our sample deviates significantly from this alignment. The reasons are manifold: either the $\gamma$-ray fit is not reliable or some precession and external torque avoid an almost perfect alignment.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) MIRI MRS gas molecular content of an externally irradiated Herbig disk, the F-type XUE 10 source, in the context of the eXtreme UV Environments (XUE) program. XUE 10 belongs to the massive star cluster NGC 6357 (1.69 kpc), where it is exposed to an external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation $\approx$ 10$^3$ times stronger than in the Solar neighborhood. We modeled the molecular features in the mid-infrared spectrum with Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) 0D slab models. We derived basic parameters of the stellar host from a VLT FORS2 optical spectrum using PHOENIX stellar templates. We detect bright CO2 gas with the first simultaneous detection (> 5$\sigma$) of four isotopologues (12CO2, 13CO2, 16O12C18O, 16O12C17O) in a protoplanetary disk. We also detect faint CO emission (2$\sigma$) and the HI Pf$\alpha$ line (8$\sigma$). We also place strict upper limits on the water content, finding a total column density $\lesssim$ 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. The CO2 species trace low gas temperatures (300-370 K) with a range of column densities of 7.4 $\times$ 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ (16O12C17O)-1.3 $\times$ 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (12CO2) in an equivalent emitting radius of 1.15 au. The emission of 13CO2 is likely affected by line optical depth effects. 16O12C18O and 16O12C17O abundances may be isotopically anomalous compared to the 16O/18O and 16O/17O ratios measured in the interstellar medium and the Solar System. We propose that the mid-infrared spectrum of XUE 10 is explained by H2O removal either via advection or strong photo-dissociation by stellar UV irradiation, and enhanced local CO2 gas-phase production. Outer disk truncation supports the observed CO2-H2O dichotomy. A CO2 vapor enrichment in 18O and 17O can be explained by means of external UV irradiation and early on (10$^{4-5}$ yr) delivery of isotopically anomalous water ice to the inner disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Our understanding of the chemical evolution of galaxies has advanced through measurements from both distant galaxies across redshift, and our own Milky Way (MW). To form a comprehensive picture, it is essential to unify these constraints, placing them on a common scale and parlance and to understand their systematic differences. In this study, we homogenize oxygen and iron measurements from star-forming galaxies at Cosmic Noon ($z{\sim}2-3$) with resolved stellar abundances from the Local Group. The MW is divided into four components, assuming the outer halo is dominated by debris from the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) progenitor. After converting all abundances to a common Solar scale, we identify clear $\alpha$- and iron-enhancement trends with mass in the $z{\sim}2-3$ galaxies and find good agreement between these galaxies and the MW high-$\alpha$ disc in [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]. We also find excellent agreement between the [O/Fe] trends seen in the MW high- and low-$\alpha$ discs with O-abundances seen in old and young planetary nebulae in M~31 respectively, supporting the existence of $\alpha$-bimodality in the inner regions of M~31. Finally, we use globular cluster ages to project the MW and GSE back in time to $z{\sim}3$ and find that their estimated mass, oxygen and iron abundances are strikingly consistent with the mass-metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies at $z{\sim}3$. In the future, increased transparency around the choice of Solar scale and abundance methodology will make combining chemical abundances easier -- contributing to a complete picture of the chemical evolution of all galaxies.
