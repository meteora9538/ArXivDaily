 - **Abstract**
 Most stars form in dense stellar environments, where frequent close encounters can strongly perturb and reshape the early architecture of planetary systems. The solar system, with its rich population of distant comets, provides a natural laboratory to study these processes. We perform detailed numerical simulations using the LonelyPlanets framework that combines NBODY6++GPU and REBOUND, to explore the evolution of debris disks around solar system analogues embedded in stellar clusters. Two initial configurations are considered, an $Extended$ and a $Compact$ model, each containing four giant planets and either an extended or compact debris disk. We find that compact disks primarily form Kuiper belt and scattered disk-like populations through planet-disk interactions, while extended disks are more strongly shaped by stellar encounters, producing Oort cloud-like structures and interstellar comets with ejection velocities of 1-3 km/s. Stellar perturbations are most effective for encounter inclinations between $0^{\circ}$ and $30^{\circ}$, giving rise to distinct dynamical populations, like Sednoids, and inner Oort cloud analogues, and a characteristic tail in semi-major axis-eccentricity space. In coplanar encounters, the disk remains largely flattened, whereas polar flybys redistribute angular momentum vertically, producing nearly isotropic outer populations that resemble an emerging Oort cloud. Our results suggest that cometary reservoirs and interstellar objects are natural byproducts of planet-disk interactions and stellar flybys in dense clusters, linking the architecture of outer planetary systems to their birth environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Regolith simulants are essential for space research and technology development. Yet, their physical properties often differ from those of true planetary soil, particularly when compared to regolith properties in-situ, that experience notably reduced gravity. We focus on lunar regolith simulants and explore various techniques to modify existing simulants to replicate the mechanical/rheological behavior of Moon regolith in true lunar conditions. Our results are validated against data from in-situ tests conducted during the Luna and Apollo missions, enabling a direct comparison of physical properties of our enhanced simulants to true Lunar regolith, on the Moon. Analyzed in the Mohr-Coulomb model framework, the friction angle of most simulants is generally close to that of true regolith, but the measured cohesion is often higher on the Moon, notably due to the reduced gravity environment. We propose a method to increase the cohesion of an existing simulant and assess the mechanical behavior of our rheological regolith simulant using a standardized geotechnical, shear test. The experimental results are then directly compared to in-situ data, providing a quantitative basis for evaluating the fidelity of the enhanced simulants.

 - **Abstract**
 Merging galaxy clusters exhibit strong observational evidence for efficient particle acceleration in the intracluster medium (ICM), particularly in the form of synchrotron-emitting radio relics and halos. Cosmic ray (CR) electrons are likely accelerated (or re-accelerated) at merger and accretion shocks via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). However, in the presence of the large diffusion coefficients one would naively expect in the rarefied, relatively unmagnetized ICM, this acceleration--in particular, the maximum proton energy ($E_{\rm max}$)--is limited by long acceleration times. On the other hand, recent work on CR transport suggests that the diffusion coefficient can be suppressed in ICM-like environments. In this picture, deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium can trigger the mirror instability, creating plasma-scale magnetic structures, or "micromirrors," that efficiently scatter CRs. In this paper, we investigate the implications of micromirror confinement for shock acceleration in the ICM. We demonstrate that micromirrors enforce a minimum value of $E_{\rm max} \gtrsim 100$ GeV that does not rely on CR-driven magnetic field amplification. We also discuss micromirror confinement in the context of cosmological simulations and $\gamma$-ray observations, and present a simulation of a Coma-like merging cluster that self-consistently includes CR acceleration at shocks, with an effective diffusion coefficient set by micromirrors. We show that the introduction of micromirrors yields simulated galaxy clusters that remain consistent with $\gamma$-ray observations.
#### Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Roman Sees Where You Are: Predicting Exoplanet Transit Yields in the Rosette Nebula with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 Young stars host only a small fraction of the known exoplanet population because their photometric variability, magnetic activity, and frequent placement in dense, poorly-resolved regions hamper exoplanet detections. Yet, measuring planets at these ages is crucial since these phases are when dynamical processes that drive planetary migration are most active. We assess the expected yield of a hypothetical Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope transit survey of the Rosette Nebula, a $\sim10\,\mathrm{Myr}$ star-forming region with a dense and diverse stellar population. Using the Roman Exposure Time Calculator to quantify sensitivity to Rosette members, we establish detection thresholds for companions and evaluate yields via Monte Carlo injection-recovery simulations. We predict the detection of $33 \pm 9$ young transiting exoplanets orbiting stellar hosts in a month-long survey, and $29 \pm 8$ in a two-week survey. The extended baseline primarily improves sensitivity to longer-period planets orbiting FGK stars, while most M dwarf detections are well-sampled within two weeks. Irrespective of the temporal baseline, transit detections are dominated by of 1-2\,$R_\oplus$ super-Earths and sub-Neptunes with $P\lesssim8$\,days. Such a sample would substantially expand the census of only three detected planets younger than $20\,\mathrm{Myr}$, probing an age regime in which planetary radii remain inflated, the stability of close-in orbits is uncertain, and planetary migration may still be ongoing. This survey offers a path to constrain early planetary evolution and establish prime follow-up targets for the James Webb Space Telescope, Vera Rubin Observatory, and the Habitable Worlds Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 The tidal torque theory (TTT) predicts that galaxy spins are correlated with the surrounding tidal field, reflecting how angular momentum is acquired during structure formation. We present a new observational test of this prediction using the final data release of the SDSS-IV MaNGA integral field spectroscopy survey, which enables direct spin measurements from stellar and ionized gas kinematics for nearly 10,000 galaxies. Unlike previous studies that relied on filament orientations, we directly utilize the three-dimensional tidal field reconstructed from the galaxy distribution, providing a physically defined reference frame for the analysis. We find that massive galaxies tend to align their spins parallel to the intermediate axis of the tidal field, consistent with the prediction of the TTT. They also tend to orient perpendicular to the major axis, hinting at the possible influence of baryonic processes. In contrast, low-mass galaxies exhibit the opposite trend, with a transition mass of $M_*\sim10^{10}-10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$. No significant alignment is detected with respect to the minor axis across all stellar masses. We further examine the dependence on morphology and environment, finding that S0 and early-type spiral galaxies exhibit stronger alignment signals than late-type spirals. The alignment trend becomes particularly pronounced in regions of high tidal anisotropy and high overdensity. A mutual information analysis identifies these environmental factors as the dominant drivers of the observed trends. Our results provide the most direct empirical evidence to date for the connection between galaxy spins and the cosmic tidal field.
#### Unlocking the radio-gamma spectrum of the pulsar wind nebula around PSR J1124-5916 in SNR G292.0+1.8

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detection of GeV $\gamma$-ray emission potentially associated with the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) hosted by the young core-collapse supernova remnant G292.0+1.8, based on a detailed time-resolved analysis of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data. By isolating the unpulsed component from the dominant magnetospheric radiation of PSR~J1124$-$5916, we successfully disentangle a candidate nebular emission in the GeV range, characterise its morphology and extract its spectrum. This identification places G292.0+1.8 among the few systems in which the pulsar and PWN contributions have been spectrally resolved at high energies, offering new insight into their respective emission mechanisms. We characterise the $\gamma$-ray spectrum of the pulsar and model the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the PWN using radio, X-ray, and GeV data. The emission is well described by a single electron population with two spectral breaks: one intrinsic to the injection spectrum and another produced by synchrotron cooling in a magnetic field of $\sim$15~$\mu$G. Notably, the inferred magnetic field and the low TeV flux of the nebula resemble those of 3C~58, suggesting that similar low-field environments can arise in young PWNe. The high-energy portion of the SED is now tightly constrained by our GeV detection and existing TeV upper limits. Compared to our model, earlier predictions tend to underpredict the $\gamma$-ray flux, while others that succeed in reproducing the GeV component often overpredict the TeV emission. This mismatch underscores the challenges in modelling particle acceleration and radiation processes in young PWNe and establishes G292.0+1.8 as a valuable benchmark for testing and refining such models.
#### The Dynamical Environment within the Habitable Zone of the Gaia-4 and Gaia-5 Planetary Systems

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanetary systems exhibit a broad range of architectures which, in turn, enable a variety of dynamical environments. Many of the known planetary systems do not transit the host star, and so we measure the minimum masses of their planets, making it difficult to fully assess the dynamical environment within the system. Astrometry can resolve the mass ambiguity and thus allow a more complete dynamical analysis of systems to be conducted. Gaia-4 and Gaia-5 are two such systems, whose study with radial velocities and data from the Gaia mission revealed that each star harbors a massive planet on a highly eccentric orbit. In this work, we provide the results of a dynamical analysis of each system, including calculations of the Habitable Zone (HZ), from which we show that the presence of the known companions largely exclude the presence of planets within the HZ. We discuss the diagnostics of potential past planet-planet scattering events, and the occurrence of similar systems whereby a giant planet on an eccentric orbit can substantially disrupt orbital integrity of terrestrial planets. These "wrecking ball" systems have an impact on the target selection for planned direct imaging missions that seek to identify potentially habitable environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a sample of 212 early-type galaxies (ETGs) at redshifts $0.25 < z < 0.75$. We combine deep integral-field spectroscopy from the MUSE-DEEP survey with high-resolution HST imaging to study the structure, kinematics, and stellar populations of these galaxies. We measure spatially resolved stellar kinematics and use the specific angular momentum proxy, $\lambda_R$, to classify galaxies into fast and slow rotators. We find a slow rotator fraction consistent with local Universe samples, suggesting little evolution in the massive ETG population since $z \sim 1$. The kinematic and photometric axes of fast rotators are generally well-aligned, similar to their local counterparts. We find that global stellar population properties, such as age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio ($M_*/L$), correlate strongly with the central velocity dispersion ($\sigma_\mathrm{e}$), following trends established for local ETGs. Slow rotators are typically more massive, have higher $\sigma_\mathrm{e}$, and are more metal-rich than fast rotators. Our findings indicate that the fundamental structural, kinematic, and stellar population scaling relations of massive ETGs were already in place by $z \sim 0.75$, suggesting their evolutionary pathways have remained stable over the last $\sim 7$ Gyr.
#### MAGNUS II: Rotational support of massive early-type galaxies decreased over the past 7 billion years

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how the internal kinematics of massive galaxies evolve is key to constraining the physical processes that drive their assembly. We investigate the evolution of rotational support in massive ($\log M_{\ast}/M_{\odot} \geq 10.6$) early-type galaxies (ETGs) over the past $\sim$7 Gyr. We use MUSE integral-field spectroscopic (IFS) data for 212 ETGs at intermediate redshift ($0.25 < z < 0.75$) from the MAGNUS sample. We compare their kinematics to a carefully matched local sample of 787 ETGs ($z \leq 0.05$) from the MaNGA survey. Using the specific stellar angular momentum proxy, $\lambda_R$, we quantify the balance between ordered rotation and random motions. We derive intrinsic $\lambda_R$ values by applying a uniform correction for seeing and point-spread function (PSF) effects to both samples. We find a significant evolutionary trend: the intermediate-redshift ETGs are systematically more rotationally supported than their local counterparts. The median PSF-corrected $\lambda_R$ for the MAGNUS sample is $0.48 \pm 0.05$, substantially higher than the median of $0.34 \pm 0.03$ for the matched MaNGA sample. This corresponds to a positive slope in the $\lambda_R-z$ relation of $\mathrm{d} \lambda_R / \mathrm{d} z = 0.3 \pm 0.04$ for the combined sample. The decline in rotational support is most pronounced for the most massive galaxies ($\log M_{\ast}/M_{\odot} > 11.3$). Our results provide robust evidence that massive ETGs have undergone significant kinematic evolution, losing angular momentum as they evolve towards the present day, consistent with theoretical models where processes such as dry mergers play a crucial role in shaping the dynamical state of galaxies.
#### Cosmological Evolution of Gamma Ray Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are classified as long (LGRBs) and short (SGRBs) with collapsars and compact object mergers (neutron star (NS)-NS or NS-Black hole) as progenitors, respectively. The former are expected to follow the cosmic star formation rate (SFR), while the latter follows a delayed version of the SFR. However, this division has come under question in several ways, the most prominent being the observational evidence of a significant excess of LGRBs at low redhifts by several independent investigations, summarized in arXiv:2305.15081. This could indicate that the progenitors of low-redshift LGRBs, whose formation rates are delayed, (similar to that of SGRBs) are compact mergers rather than collapsars. Two recent observations of low-redshift LGRBs show associations with kilonovae, a clear feature of compact mergers. Most results showing this separation are based on analyses of small (less than 200) samples of LGRBs with measured redshifts. The aim of this paper is to use a larger sample of LGRBs. The number of LGRBs with measured redshifts has increased by more than a factor of 2 over the last decade. To this data set we add a sample of LGRBs whose redshifts are estimated using a machine learning (ML) method (arXiv:2410.13985). This, in addition to increasing the sample size, reduces the observational selection bias arising from the process of redshift measurement. To account for this bias, we use the non-parametric, non-binning Efron-Petrosian method to establish the degree of correlation between luminosity and redshift, the luminosity evolution, which then allows us to use the Lynden-Bell $C^-$ method to obtain a complete description of the luminosity function. We find similar low redshift excess for the larger sample with measured redshifts. Adding the sources with ML-estimated redshifts, which tend to have more sources in mid-range redshifts, the excess is reduced.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose to use the unprecedented polarization sensitivity of PRIMA's PRIMAger Polarization Imager and its high resolution in Band 1 (92 $\mu$m) to map magnetic fields across two contrasting molecular cloud environments: the well-studied Perseus cloud and the isolated Musca filament. This comparative study will leverage the existing VLA radio observations that provide line-of-sight magnetic field component of the Perseus cloud, along with upcoming POSSUM survey results for Musca, to construct the first detailed 3D magnetic field vector maps at sub-parsec resolution. Perseus, with its known formation history through interstellar structure (e.g., bubble) interactions, will reveal how magnetic fields evolve during active star formation phases, while Musca, an isolated filament with lower star-formation activity, will show magnetic field morphology in early evolutionary stages. With PRIMA's resolution of 0.01 pc for Perseus and $<0.01$ pc for Musca, we will resolve magnetic field structures at scales necessary for understanding cloud fragmentation and star formation efficiency, and the roles that magnetic fields play in these processes. Our survey will require approximately 1438 hours to cover 42 deg$^2$ of Perseus and 12 deg$^2$ of Musca. With this, we aim to provide the first comprehensive view of how environment and evolutionary state may influence magnetic field evolution in molecular clouds and how magnetic fields influence cloud formation, fragmentation, and star formation.
#### How External Medium outside Prestellar Cores Affects Protostellar Growth: Variations in Accretion Rate and Evolution of Disks and Outflows

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how the external medium surrounding prestellar cores affects the star formation process by conducting three-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The initial cores follow critical Bonnor-Ebert profiles and are embedded in environments with different ambient densities. The simulations follow the evolution at least until the envelope mass within a radius equal to twice the critical Bonnor-Ebert radius drops to 35% of the initial cloud mass. We reveal that in environments with higher external density, enhanced mass inflow from the envelope leads to Bondi-like accretion as the protostellar mass increases. The continued inflow substantially increases the final stellar mass, resulting in star formation efficiencies that appear to exceed unity in dense environments. The external medium also influences the evolution of circumstellar disks and protostellar outflows: with the high-density external medium, disks grow rapidly but their mass becomes smaller relative to the protostellar mass, and the outflow is sustained over a long duration. However, the ratio of angular momentum removed by outflows and magnetic braking to that introduced by inflowing gas decreases with increasing external density. These results suggest that the density of the external medium regulates not only protostellar mass growth but also the inflow-outflow balance and angular momentum transport in magnetized, rotating star-forming cores.
#### Diverse Emission Patterns from Precessing Super-Eddington Disks Formed in Tidal Disruption Events

 - **Abstract**
 A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star passes within the tidal radius of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). In TDEs it is expected that the orbital angular momentum of the disrupted star is generally misaligned with the SMBH spin axis, which should result in a misaligned super-Eddington disk precessing around the SMBH spin axis due to the Lense-Thirring effect. In this paper, we investigate the distinct observational signatures produced from such TDE disks, by performing radiative transfer calculations upon previous super-Eddington disk simulations. We demonstrate that the precession of the disk and wind drive time-dependent obscuration and reprocessing of X-ray radiation. Depending on the orientation of the viewing angle of the observer and the tilt angle of the disk, four main types of variability are induced: 1) The smooth-TDEs: The emissions from these TDEs show no fluctuations; 2) The dimmer: The main emission type (X-ray or optical) stays the same, with small to moderate modulations of brightness; 3) The blinker: X-ray and optical emissions take turns to dominate in one cycle of precession, with dramatic changes in the X-ray fluxes. 4) The siren: X-ray and optical emissions take over each other twice per cycle, possibly with two different peak X-ray fluxes within one cycle. In all three scenarios, we observe an inverse correlation between X-ray and optical emissions. Our model provides a unified physical framework for interpreting TDE multi-wavelength variability through disk precession dynamics and gives an alternative interpretation to the interesting case of J045650.3-203750 which was suggested to be a repeated partial TDE previously.
#### Eclipsed X-ray Bursts from Magnetar SGR J1935+2154 and the Fireball Measurements

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray bursts from the magnetar can lead to the formation of fireballs trapped by the magnetic field and co-rotating with the star. The fireball emission could occasionally be eclipsed by the magnetar, especially when the burst duration is comparable to the magnetar's spin period. In this work, we discover a peculiar type of burst whose light curve has a plateau-like feature among the long bursts of the magnetar SGR J1935+2154. Based on these bursts, we identified four burst candidates with eclipse-like characteristics. By fitting their light curves with the eclipse fireball model, the viewing angle of the magnetar relative to its spin axis is estimated to be $17^\circ \pm 10^\circ$. The distances from the fireballs to the magnetar are found to be more than five times the magnetar's radius, indicating that the fireballs are suspended in the magnetosphere rather than adhering to the magnetar surface. We also find this configuration is well consistent with the implication of the cyclotron resonance scattering feature in their spectra. Our results suggest that some intermediate X-ray bursts of SGR 1935+2154 may originate from magnetic reconnection within the magnetosphere rather than the starquake.

 - **Abstract**
 The design of an indigenous Lunar Navigation Satellite System (LNSS) is receiving growing attention due to the surge in planned lunar missions and the limited accessibility of Earth-based Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in the cislunar environment. Several studies have explored LNSS architecture using geometric analysis in both near and distant lunar orbits. The existing LNSS optimization efforts have primarily focused on global lunar coverage using analytical station-keeping models with low accuracy. Furthermore, current south pole-focused research is restricted to Elliptical Lunar Frozen Orbits (ELFOs) and lacks comprehensive optimization approach. Additionally, integration with Earth GNSS systems for ephemeris computation and time synchronization has not been adequately addressed in prior studies. In this work, we present a comprehensive LNSS mission design framework based on evolutionary multi-objective optimization integrated with a high-fidelity numerical lunar orbit propagation model. The optimization simultaneously considers navigation performance in the lunar south pole region, semi-analytical continuous station-keeping maneuver model for realistic dV estimate, and GPS-LNSS integration analysis parameters. The resulting Pareto front offers a diverse set of LNSS configurations that balance coverage, accuracy, and dV requirements. Notably, the optimization identifies diverse non-frozen elliptical orbit solutions that achieve over 90% south pole coverage with acceptable navigation accuracy using as few as six satellites and dV of less than 0.4 km/s per satellite per year. This represents a significant reduction in constellation size compared to previous studies, offering a cost-effective yet operationally efficient solution for future LNSS missions.

 - **Abstract**
 High rates of stable mass transfer (MT) occur for some binary star systems, resulting in luminous transients and circumbinary outflows. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of a $10 \ M_\odot$ donor star and a $5\ M_\odot$ point mass secondary, incorporating approximate effects of radiative cooling. By varying the orbital separation of the system, we probe MT rates between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-1} M_\odot$/yr. Mass flows from the donor into an accretion disk, with significant equatorially-concentrated outflows through the outer Lagrange point L2 occurring for MT rates $\gtrsim 10^{-3} M_\odot$/yr, while the MT remaining mostly conservative for lower MT rates. In all cases, any outflowing gas approximately carries the specific angular momentum of L2. The gas cooling luminosity $L$ and temperature increases with MT rate, with $L \sim 10^{5} L_\odot$ and $T \sim 10^4 \, {\rm K}$ for simulations featuring the strongest outflows, with contributions from both the accretion disk and circumbinary outflow. The most luminous transients associated with mass outflows will be rare due to the high MT rate requirement, but generate significant optical emission from both the accretor's disk and the circumbinary outflow.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar mass is a fundamental quantity that determines the properties and evolution of stars. However, estimating stellar masses in star-forming regions is challenging because young stars are obscured by dense gas and the regions are highly inhomogeneous, making spherical dynamical estimates unreliable. Supervised machine learning could link such complex structures to stellar mass, but it requires large, high-quality labeled datasets from high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations, which are computationally expensive. We address this by pretraining a vision transformer on one million synthetic fractal images using the self-supervised framework DINOv2, and then applying the frozen model to limited high-resolution MHD simulations. Our results demonstrate that synthetic pretraining improves frozen-feature regression stellar mass predictions, with the pretrained model performing slightly better than a supervised model trained on the same limited simulations. Principal component analysis of the extracted features further reveals semantically meaningful structures, suggesting that the model enables unsupervised segmentation of star-forming regions without the need for labeled data or fine-tuning.

 - **Abstract**
 Growing observational evidence suggests that Class II protoplanetary disks may undergo substantial interactions with their environment in the form of late infall. This mass inflow predominantly manifests itself in the form of so-called streamers: filaments and arcs of gas connecting large-scale, extended gas structures to disk scales. Prevalent late infall has far-reaching consequences for planet formation theory, challenging the long-standing treatment of evolved disks in isolation. In this work, we investigate the emergence of late-infall streamers in different formation scenarios, their morphology and multiplicity, as well as their dependence on environmental conditions. We conduct this investigation by performing 3D hydrodynamical simulation using the grid-based code FARGO3D, which we post-process to obtain synthetic observations using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that, while a late infall event in the form of a single encounter with a "cloudlet" of gas can produce a streamer via an interplay between the fall-back of bound material and shocks, such features dissipate quickly, on a timescale of ~10 kyr. Furthermore, we find that streamers can also form naturally in a turbulent, dense environment without the need for such encounters, which could act to reconcile short-lived streamers with ubiquitous detection of these structures. Here, we find multiple co-existing streamers for a disk velocity relative to the interstellar medium of $v_\mathrm{sys}=0.5~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and a turbulent velocity dispersion of $\sigma_\mathrm{turb}=0.5~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We find considerable dependence of the streamer morphology on the environment, which may act as a utility to constrain the physical conditions of the gas surrounding planet-forming disk, and therefore the conditions under which planets form.

 Multiple populations (MPs) is a intra-star cluster phenomenon consisting in star-to- star variation of the abundance of some light chemical elements. They have been observed in many star clusters, most of them old globular clusters, populating the Milky Way and other satellite galaxies. Since the study of MPs became more system- atic, different astrophysical parameters have been claimed to be the main responsible for its occurrence. However, at the present time, no attempt would seem to have solved this conundrum. This work deals with a potential trigger of the MPs phenomenon, based on the gathered observational evidence of the existence of MPs in some star clusters and the absence of its in others. We found that star clusters with MPs mostly formed during time intervals of intense star formation activity in a galaxy, for instance during the galaxy formation epoch, a close galaxy encounter, etc. At those time inter- vals where relative peaks in the galaxy star formation rate occur, star clusters with masses above a lower mass limit harbour MPs. This lower star cluster mass limit would marginally depend on the star cluster age.

 In this two-paper series, we present a straightforward mathematical model for synthesizing quasar absorption line profiles from sight lines through idealized, spatial-kinematic models of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and their host galaxies. Here, in Paper I, we develop the spatial geometries of multiple galaxy/CGM structures and populate these structures with 3D velocity fields. For arbitrary viewing angles and galaxy-quasar impact parameters, we derive observer coordinate-based expressions for the perceived azimuthal angle and galaxy inclination and a generalized scalar expression for the line-of-sight velocity as a function of position along the line of sight. We motivate and develop four idealized galaxy/CGM spatial-kinematic structures based on empirical data and theoretical predictions: (1) a rotating galactic disk/extra-planar gas, (2) a static or dynamic spherical halo, (3) an outflowing bi-polar galactic wind, and (4) an inward spiraling flared planar accretion. Using a small set of free parameters, the spatial geometries and velocity fields can be adjusted and explored, including velocity gradients, wind stalling, and accretion trajectories. These spatial-kinematic models are designed to be flexible and easily modified and can be tailored for studying individual galaxy-absorber pairs or galaxy group environments; they can be applied to real-world observations or hydrodynamic simulations of the baryon cycle as studied through quasar absorption line systems. These models also serve as tools for developing physical intuition. In Paper II, we will present the formalism for populating the galaxy/CGM structures with multiphase photoionized and collisionally ionized gas and for generating absorption profiles for ions of interest.

 - **Abstract**
 We selected Bulge stars from APOGEE DR17 cross-matched with astrometric data from \textit{Gaia} DR3. Bulge stars were divided into sub-samples with line-of-sight velocity dispersion analyzed and the peaks of MDF were detected by both Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and \texttt{this http URL\_peaks}. GMM is also conducted to kinematically distinguish the metal-poor and metal-rich populations. Analyses were put on the Bulge stars (including retrograde stars), their elemental abundances, and the [Mg/Mn]-[Al/Fe] plane to investigate potential accreted components. Finally, the shapes (X-shaped/boxy) of Bulge stars with different metallicities were analyzed through least-squares fitting based on the analytical Bulge models. By studying the kinematic, elemental and structural dependences on metallicity for Bulge stars, our findings are concluded as follows: 1. Six peaks are detected in the Bulge MDF, encompassing values reported in previous studies, suggesting a complex composition of Bulge populations. 2. An inversion relationship is well-observed in metal-rich sub-samples, while absent in metal-poor sub-samples. 3. Metal-poor populations exhibit larger dispersions than metal-rich stars (which is also revealed by GMM decomposition), suggesting that metal-rich stars are kinematically coherent. 4. Retrograde stars are confined to $\sim1$ kpc of the Galactic center, with their relative fraction decreasing at higher [Fe/H] -- a trend potentially linked to the ``spin-up'' process of Galactic disks. 5. Metal-rich Bulge stars with [Al/Fe] $<-0.15$ are likely associated with from disk accreted substructure, while all elemental planes exhibit bimodality but Na abundances rise monotonically with metallicity. 6. In general, stars with all metallicities support a boxy profile.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) remains an open questions in astrophysics. We explore two primary scenarios for the distribution of UHECR sources, assuming that their production rate follows either the cosmic star-formation-rate or stellar-mass density. By jointly fitting the UHECR energy spectrum and mass composition measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory above the ankle (10^{18.7} eV), we derive constraints on the acceleration mechanisms, source energetics, and elemental abundances at escape. Using these constraints, we generate sky maps above 40 EeV based on a catalog of over 400,000 galaxies out to 350 Mpc, providing a near-infrared flux-limited sample that maps the two stellar-activity tracers across the full sky. A crucial factor in understanding UHECR propagation is the influence of large-scale cosmic structures, particularly galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound systems in the Universe, which are filled with magnetized diffuse plasma. Intermittent sources hosted in galaxies within such structures, coupled with cosmic magnetic fields, shape the observed UHECR arrival directions and provide insights into the burst rate of the sources. We show that these environments can significantly impact UHECR transport, making them particularly opaque to heavy nuclei. Additionally, we compute the expected secondary neutrino and photon fluxes from UHECR interactions in these environments and compare them with current experimental limits, constraining the maximum energy that particles can achieve. Finally, we assess the compatibility of these constraints with astrophysical candidates, identifying long gamma-ray bursts as the most promising sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbonaceous nano-grains are a significant component of interstellar dust and dominate the mid-infrared emission of photodissociation regions (PDRs). We study the evolution of nano-grains across the illuminated edge of the Horsehead PDR, especially their abundance and size properties. This work is part of the Physics and Chemistry of PDR Fronts program studying dust and gas in PDRs with JWST. We use NIRCam+MIRI photometric bands and NIRSpec+MRS spectroscopy to map the illuminated edge. We model dust emission using the THEMIS dust model with the SOC radiative transfer code. Detailed modeling of high angular resolution JWST data allows us to obtain constraints on nano-grain properties. We find that diffuse ISM dust cannot account for the observed data, requiring evolved grains. A sharp density increase is observed at the illuminated edge, consistent with ALMA observations revealing a sharp transition between molecular and ionized gas. Although the PDR length could not be directly determined, we estimate an upper limit of approximately 0.015 pc. This implies a lower limit on small grain abundance (greater than 0.003), showing small grains are not depleted at the Horsehead edge, unlike in the Orion Bar. Our findings indicate a high-density environment and less steep size distribution for nano-grains at the illuminated edge versus the diffuse ISM. This implies nano-grain destruction mechanisms might be less efficient in the Horsehead's moderate-UV field than in more intense PDRs. These results support a model where nano-grain population recovery is slower in moderate-UV environments, leading to a unique dust size distribution at the edge of the Horsehead Nebula.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of $\gamma$-rays from diffuse gas provide the opportunity to study the distribution of high energy particles in different astrophysical environments. In the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the intracluster medium (ICM), it is expected that relativistic cosmic rays collide with thermal particles and produce $\gamma$-rays through pion decay. The $\gamma$-ray luminosity of a plasma depends on where cosmic rays are: if they are in denser gas, they produce more $\gamma$-rays. In this work, we study how different cosmic-ray transport mechanisms impact the $\gamma$-ray luminosity of a turbulent, multiphase medium formed from an initially diffuse medium. Two quantities set the luminosity: the average cosmic-ray energy density and the correlation of cosmic-ray energy and gas density. Overall, cosmic rays must escape cold dense regions in order to produce less $\gamma$-ray emission and be consistent with observations. Our simulations with fast transport mechanisms (either diffusion or streaming) are degenerate: they each produce a lower $\gamma$-ray luminosity than slow transport simulations by two orders of magnitude. This result means that fast transport (particularly in dense clumps) is necessary for simulations to agree with the dearth of observations of $\gamma$-ray emission from diffuse gas like the CGM and ICM. We also show the significant difference in luminosity is the result of cosmic-ray reacceleration. This reacceleration is different from the turbulent reacceleration described by Ptuskin (1988). Instead, condensing, cold clouds drive a significant increase in the average cosmic-ray energy and, as a result, the $\gamma$-ray luminosity.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of rings and moons around exoplanets is likely to be one of the next great discoveries in exoplanet research. Using theories developed for the Solar System, we explore the possibility of coupled ring-moon cycles around exoplanets and what these processes mean for the observability of these features. Around Neptune- and Earth-like planets, we find that ring-moon cycles are capable of producing long-lived rings of comparable and greater relative transit depths than Saturn's. In multi-planet systems, secular spin-orbit resonances can provide the necessary planetary obliquity for these rings to contribute noticeably to transit lightcurves. We model the geometry of a ring's cross-section at various angles in comparison to the cross-section of a transiting planet to determine whether the ring may be detectable during the planet's transit. Ringed planets have also been proposed as an alternative to inflated planetary radii seen in transit, leading to abnormally low observed densities. Ring-moon cycles can produce late-forming and sometimes long-lived rings that can have the potential of explaining at least some of these observations. We also discuss some inconsistencies in the calculation of exoplanet oblateness due to rotation that we have come across in the course of this work.
