 - **Abstract**
 The removal of gas left over from star formation has long been thought to dominate the dynamical evolution, and dissolution of star-forming regions. Feedback from massive stars from their stellar winds, photoionising radiation and supernovae is postulated to expel significant amounts of gas, altering the gravitational potential energy of the star-forming region and causing a supervirial expansion, which disperses the stars into the Galaxy on rapid timescales (<10Myr). The majority of previous work has utilised N-body simulations with a background potential to model the effects of gas removal. Here, we adopt a different approach where we take the end point of hydrodynamic simulations of star formation in which stars form with and without feedback from massive stars and then evolve the stars as N-body simulations. We also scale the velocities of the stars to various virial ratios, to mimic slower or faster removal of gas, and evolve these as additional N-body simulations. We find that the simulations where the stars inherit the velocities of the sink particles from the hydrodynamic simulations predominantly evolve more like a simulation in virial equilibrium, rather than the supervirial behaviour we would expect after gas removal. We see no significant differences in the dynamical evolution between the simulations where the stars inherit velocities directly from the hydrodynamical simulations and the simulations with (sub)virial velocities. This strongly suggests that gas removal by feedback processes does not lead to rapid expansion of star-forming regions, beyond the expansion caused by dynamical relaxation in star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Central starbursts and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are thought to be fueled by either galaxy interactions or secular processes in gravitationally unstable discs. We employ cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project to propose a new nuclear fueling scenario based on the transition that galaxies undergo from bursty to smooth star formation and from prominent global galactic winds to inefficient stellar feedback as they grow above $M_{\star}\sim 10^{10-10.5}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$: the last major galactic wind event shuts down star formation, evacuates gas from the galaxy, and slows down gas accretion from the circumgalactic medium (CGM), creating a $\sim$$10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ pileup of gas in the inner CGM which later accretes coherently onto the galaxy, achieving a tenfold increase in inflow rate over pre-outflow conditions. We explicitly track the accumulation of gas along the outflow pathway owing to hydrodynamic interactions and show that $\sim$50% of gas fueling the central $\sim$10-100$\,{\rm pc}$ over the subsequent $\sim$15$\,{\rm Myr}$ can be traced back to pileup gas having experienced $>$50% change in infall velocity owing to the wind interaction. This galactic wind pileup effect may thus represent a significant fueling mode for compact starbursts and luminous AGN. Galactic winds at earlier times or AGN-driven outflows can have qualitatively similar effects, but the pileup of gas driven by the last major galactic wind event refuels the galaxy precisely when the deepening stellar potential prevents further gas evacuation by stellar feedback, providing the ideal conditions for quasar fueling at the time when AGN feedback is most needed to regulate central star formation in massive galaxies at their peak of activity.

 - **Abstract**
 The orbits of small bodies in the outer solar system are particularly sensitive to gravitational perturbations, including stellar flybys. Stellar clusters, with low velocity dispersions and high number densities, can be the source of strong and frequent flybys. As a result, we can infer what properties of the solar birth environment would be incompatible with the structure of the outer solar system observed today. Here, we explore with $n-$body simulations the implications of the low inclinations ($i < 20^{\circ}$) of the distant sednoids (objects with perihelia $q > 40 \mathrm{\; AU}$ and semimajor axes $a > 400 \mathrm{\; AU}$) for the properties of the solar birth cluster. We find that the existence of these orbits, if they were in place in the Sun's birth cluster phase, would limit the product of the stellar number density and the Sun's residence time in the birth cluster to $\lesssim 5 \times 10^3 \mathrm{\; Myr \; pc^{-3}}$, as compared to the weaker limit $\lesssim 5 \times 10^4 \mathrm{\; Myr \; pc^{-3}}$ implied by the low inclinations of the cold classical Kuiper belt.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational instability (GI) has long been considered a viable pathway for giant planet formation in protoplanetary disks (PPDs), especially at wide orbital separations or around low-mass stars where core accretion faces significant challenges. However, a primary drawback is that disk fragmentation from GI was generally found to produce over-massive clumps, typically in the mass range of brown dwarfs, although most numerical studies adopted simplified cooling prescriptions or with limited numerical resolution. We conduct a suite of global three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations of self-gravitating PPDs using the meshless finite-mass (MFM) method. By implementing radiation transport via the M1 closure and systematically varying disk mass and opacity, we show that increasing disk mass and lowering opacity promote fragmentation by enhancing radiative cooling. Non-fragmenting disks settle into a gravito-turbulent state with low-order spiral structures and effective angular momentum transport characterized by $\alpha \sim \beta_\mathrm{cool}^{-1}$. In fragmenting disks, a subset of gravitationally bound clumps survives as long-lived fragments. Their initial masses form a consistent distribution around $\Sigma \cdot\lambda_\mathrm{T} \cdot 2 (c_s/\Omega_\mathrm{K})$ (with $\lambda_T$ the Toomre wavelength), corresponding to $\sim 0.3 - 10\,M_\mathrm{J}$ in our simulations, consistent with being gas giants. These results demonstrate that GI can produce planet-mass fragments under more realistic conditions, reinforcing it as a viable gas giant formation pathway and motivating further studies of fragment evolution and observational signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 Water is essential to our understanding of the planet-formation process and habitability on Earth. Although trace amounts of water are seen across all phases of star and planet formation, the bulk of the water reservoir often goes undetected, hiding crucial parts of its journey from giant molecular clouds to planets. This raises the question of whether water molecules in comets and (exo-)planets is largely inherited from the interstellar medium or if the water molecules are destroyed and then reformed in the disk. Water isotopologue ratios involving doubly deuterated water (D$_2$O) are a sensitive tracer to answer this question. We present strong evidence of inheritance through an enhancement of D$_2$O in the outbursting V883 Ori disk. The high D$_2$O/H$_2$O ratio of $(3.2 \pm 1.2) \times 10^{-5}$ is consistent with values seen in protostellar envelopes and a comet and is two orders of magnitude higher than expected if water is reprocessed. The high deuteration of the heaviest isotopologues D$_2$O/HDO = $(2.3 \pm 1.0) \times $HDO/H$_2$O further establishes the inheritance of water. We conclude that water ice in disks originates from the earliest phases of star formation, providing the missing link between cold dark clouds and (exo-)comets.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern cosmological simulations have now matured to the point of reproducing the evolution of realistic galaxy populations across cosmic time. These simulations rely on feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) to quench massive galaxies, yet the details of this process remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we introduce RAFIKI (Refining AGN Feedback In Kinetic Implementations), a novel suite of simulations built upon SIMBA-C that vary the mass loading of AGN-driven winds. Unlike the fiducial SIMBA-C simulation, RAFIKI separates the efficiencies of the two kinetic feedback modes, enabling a detailed study of their impact on galaxies, black holes, and the circumgalactic medium. We explore a range of galaxy and baryon properties in the RAFIKI runs and find that even with enhanced mass loading, the lower-velocity, quasar-type mode cannot quench massive galaxies. However, it plays a significant role in regulating black hole growth and star formation in intermediate-mass galaxies. We also uncover degeneracies in the parameter space that highlight the limited current constraints on AGN feedback. RAFIKI provides a controlled framework to disentangle these degeneracies using current and upcoming observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The physically motivated definition of galaxy size proposed recently, linked to the farther location of the in-situ star formation, considerably reduces the scatter of the galaxy mass-size relation, and provide a viable method to infer the galaxy stellar mass from its size. We provide a similar relation correlating the size of galaxies with the size of their dark matter haloes by leveraging the small scatter of the aforementioned relation. We analysed the simulated galaxies of the two main cosmological volumes of the EAGLE simulations, and computed the size of galaxies and their mass mimicking the observational analysis. For central galaxies, we computed the relation between galaxy size and halo size. We show that the simulated galaxies reproduce the observed stellar mass-size relation's normalisation and slope. The scatter of this relation, 0.06 dex, matches the intrinsic scatter measured in observation. We then computed the correlation between galaxy size and halo size, and found that the relation is steeper than when using the half-mass radius as measure of size, with the scatter (0.1 dex) a factor of two smaller than the observed relation. As well, the galaxy-to-halo mass relation derived from simulations provides a factor of two better scatter than observed. This opens the possibility of measuring the size of dark matter haloes with great accuracy (less than fifty percent, i.e. around six times better than using the effective radius) by using only deep imaging data.
#### Targeting cluster galaxies for the 4MOST CHANCES Low-z sub-survey with photometric redshifts

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of galaxies is shaped by both internal processes and their external environments. Galaxy clusters and their surroundings provide ideal laboratories to study these effects, particularly mechanisms such as quenching and morphological transformation. The Chilean Cluster galaxy Evolution Survey (CHANCES) Low-z sub-survey is part of the CHileAN Cluster galaxy Evolution Survey, a 4MOST community survey designed to uncover the relationship between the formation and evolution of galaxies and hierarchical structure formation as it happens, through deep and wide multi-object spectroscopy. We present the target selection strategy followed to select galaxy cluster candidate members for the CHANCES low-z sub-survey, in and around 50 clusters and two superclusters at z<0.07, out to (5XR200) and down to mr= 20.4. Combining public photometric redshift estimates from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey and T80S/S-PLUS iDR5, with custom photometric redshifts, we identify likely galaxy cluster candidate members whose photometric redshifts are consistent with being at the known redshift of the cluster and measure the average deviations of their photometric redshifts with respect to the spectroscopic redshift measurements {\sigma}NMAD. We have successfully compiled our CHANCES-low-redshift catalogues, split into three different sub-surveys: low-z bright (mr<18.5), low-z faint (18.5<=mr<20.4) and low-z faint supplementary, by selecting>= 500,000 galaxy cluster candidate members and including confirmed spectroscopic galaxy cluster members, from which we expect to obtain 4MOST low-resolution (R~6500) spectra for ~320,000 galaxies. The CHANCES Low-z target catalogues form a statistically robust sample for spectroscopic follow-up, allowing studies of galaxy evolution and environmental effects in nearby cluster and supercluster environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to characterise the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and the 3D correlation between stellar mass, metallicity and star-formation rate (SFR) known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) for galaxies at $5<z<7$. Using $\sim800$ [O III] selected galaxies from deep NIRCam grism surveys, we present our stacked measurements of direct-$T\rm_e$ metallicities, which we use to test recent strong-line metallicity calibrations. Our measured direct-$T\rm_e$ metallicities ($0.1$-$0.2\,\rm Z_\odot$ for M$_\star$ $\approx5\times10^{7-9}$ M$_{\odot}$, respectively) match recent JWST/NIRSpec-based results. However, there are significant inconsistencies between observations and hydrodynamical simulations. We observe a flatter MZR slope than the SPHINX$^{20}$ and FLARES simulations, which cannot be attributed to selection effects. With simple models, we show that the effect of an [O III] flux-limited sample on the observed shape of the MZR is strongly dependent on the FMR. If the FMR is similar to the one in the local Universe, the intrinsic high-redshift MZR should be even flatter than observed. In turn, a 3D relation where SFR correlates positively with metallicity at fixed mass would imply an intrinsically steeper MZR. Our measurements indicate that metallicity variations at fixed mass show little dependence on the SFR, suggesting a flat intrinsic MZR. This could indicate that the low-mass galaxies at these redshifts are out of equilibrium and that metal enrichment occurs rapidly in low-mass galaxies. However, being limited by our stacking analysis, we are yet to probe the scatter in the MZR and its dependence on SFR. Large carefully selected samples of galaxies with robust metallicity measurements can put tight constraints on the high-redshift FMR and, help to understand the interplay between gas flows, star formation and feedback in early galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars often evolve in binary systems, in which binary interactions significantly affect their evolution. Massive stars in the Galaxy serve as valuable testbeds for this due to their proximity. We computed the evolution of more than 38000 galactic binary systems with initial primary star masses of 5...100 Msun. In this paper, we aim to investigate the surface properties of post-mass transfer mass donor and mass gainer stars through core hydrogen burning, core helium burning, and for the pre-supernova stage. The models are computed with MESA, incorporating detailed stellar and binary physics, including internal differential rotation, magnetic angular momentum transport, mass-dependent overshooting, stellar wind mass-loss, mass and angular momentum transfer and tidal interaction. They incorporate a new extensive nuclear network for hydrogen burning, which allows us to track the full range of hydrogen burning nucleosynthesis products, from the light elements to aluminum. The widest, non-interacting binary models in our grid effectively serve as single star models. We find that mass gainers and mass donors may evolve through long-lived blue and yellow supergiant stages during core helium burning where single stars of the same mass remain red supergiants. Furthermore, some of our gainers evolve into more luminous yellow and blue supergiants prior to core collapse than single stars, while some donors end their life as red or yellow supergiants, showing a rich diversity in supernova progenitors. We show that the surface elemental and isotopic abundances carry valuable information about a star's evolutionary history and can be used to distinguish binary interaction products from single stars. Our binary model grid may serve as a tool for identifying post-mass transfer stars and supernovae, and holds potential for population studies, supernova modeling, and guidance of future observations.

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift protoclusters are crucial for understanding the formation of galaxy clusters and the evolution of galaxies in dense environments. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its unprecedented near-infrared sensitivity, enables the first exploration of protoclusters beyond $z>$10. Among JWST surveys, COSMOS-Web Data Release 0.5 offers the largest area $\sim$0.27 deg$^2$, making it an optimal field for protocluster searches. In this study, we searched for protoclusters at $z\sim$9-10 using 366 F115W dropout galaxies. We evaluated the reliability of our photometric redshift by validation tests with the JADES DR3 spectroscopic sample, obtaining the likelihood of falsely identifying interlopers as $\sim25\%$. Overdensities ($\delta$) are computed by weighting galaxy positions with their photometric redshift probability density functions (PDF), using a 2.5 cMpc aperture and a redshift slice of $\pm$0.5. We selected the most promising core galaxies of protocluster candidate galaxies with an overdensity greater than the 95th percentile of the distribution of 366 F115W dropout galaxies. The member galaxies are then linked within an angular separation of 7.5 cMpc to the core galaxies, finding seven protocluster candidates. These seven protocluster candidates have inferred halo masses of $M_{\text{halo}} \sim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. The detection of such overdensities at these redshifts provides a critical test for current cosmological simulations. However, confirming these candidates and distinguishing them from low-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies or Balmer-break galaxies will require follow-up near-infrared spectroscopic observations.
#### After 54 years of bar instability studies: a fresh surprise

 - **Abstract**
 The well-known bar instability of rotationally-supported disk galaxy models has been studied extensively since its first discovery over half a century ago. We were therefore very surprised to find cases of disks embedded in rigid halos, which on the basis of widely-cited criteria should be unstable, that appeared to be robustly stable. Here we show that the unstable bar mode in such simulations was being suppressed by changes to the disk caused by other instabilities having higher angular symmetry that were the first to saturate. Although this may seem like a promising solution to the long-standing puzzle presented by the apparent stability of real disk galaxies, we also show that instability is restored in the same models when the rigid halo is replaced by a live population of particles, where the usual stability conditions apply. Our study has been confined to a narrow range of models, and we cannot therefore exclude the possibility that mode interference may be able to prevent bar formation in other models having live halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Thanks to Gaia and large-scale spectroscopic follow-up surveys (4MOST, DESI, WEAVE, SDSS-V), it is now possible to build representative and minimally biased samples of the local white dwarf population. Here we analyse several volume-limited 100pc samples of white dwarfs, constructed from different surveys and studies, to evaluate their completeness and residual biases. We model the underlying star formation history and Galactic disc age via comparison with simulated populations of white dwarfs to quantitatively characterise completeness. We assess whether the benefit of Gaia XP spectra in datasets outweighs the reduction in sample size, and to what extent targeted, part-sky, and magnitude limited surveys can be used in comparison to all-sky volume limited surveys. Additionally, we simulate the 4MOST 100PC sub-survey and discuss its use to better understand the local star formation history.
#### Niebla: an open-source code for modelling the extragalactic background light

 - **Abstract**
 Extragalactic very high-energy (VHE; $E>100\,$GeV) gamma rays suffer absorption in interactions with photons of the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL). The EBL is an isotropic diffuse photon field from optical to infrared wavelengths, which is difficult to measure directly due to strong foreground emission. We present niebla, the first open-source code to compute the EBL using a forward-folding approach that accepts fully customizable inputs. This software enables a detailed modelling of the influence of EBL opacities on VHE observations and facilitates the distinction between different dust reemission models. The code models the optical background primarily from stellar emission, by evolving the spectrum of a single stellar population as a function of redshift, considering mean metallicity evolution and star formation rate density. Additional sources to the EBL can be provided by the user. The code already includes optional contributions from, e.g., stripped stars, intra-halo light, or the decay of axion dark matter. The optical emissivity is then absorbed by interstellar dust and reemitted in the infrared regime. We provide multiple prescriptions to model this process, using spectral dust templates or a combination of blackbodies. We provide three EBL models calculated with different dust reemission prescriptions, which have been fitted to various observational data sets. In addition, we showcase the versatility of our model through a simulated observation of the blazar Markarian 501 in a high-flux state with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory array. We find that the simulated VHE spectrum is highly sensitive to the EBL opacity coming from the infrared. Our model will therefore allow the community to distinguish between different dust reemission models and constrain EBL parameters with future observations.
#### Dynamical environment and stability around Centaur (2060) Chiron

 - **Abstract**
 A recent stellar occultation revealed that the Centaur (2060) Chiron hosts a broad disk extending beyond ~200 km from its centre, embedding three ring-like structures (Chi1R, Chi2R, and Chi3R), while a tenuous outer ring (Chi4R) lies beyond the Roche limit. Here, we present a first dynamical assessment of the system's stability through numerical simulations of test particles, accounting for Chiron's triaxial figure. For an equatorial ellipticity of C22~0.02, as inferred from the most recent shape estimates, our simulations reveal a chaotic inner zone extending to ~260 km, where particle lifetimes reach up to a year, while particles beyond ~260 km can remain stable for at least a decade. These results suggest that the innermost portion of the disk is ephemeral and can only persist if continuously replenished. For lower ellipticity values (C22<0.012), however, the entire disk is located within the stable region, regardless of Chiron's mass. Under the physical parameters currently available in the literature, Chi2R is possibly linked to the 1:3 spin-orbit resonance, while Chi1R cannot be linked to the 1:2 resonance, as previously proposed, since this resonance is unstable. Instead, Chi1R and Chi3R may be associated with the 2:5 and 1:5 spin-orbit resonances, respectively. Both the 1:3 and 1:5 resonances are bifurcated, generating chaotic zones that may explain the gap in Chi2R and the longitudinal asymmetry observed in Chi3R.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers can change the rate at which stars are formed. We can trace when these changes occur in simulations of galaxy mergers. However, for observed galaxies we do not know how the star-formation rate (SFR) evolves along the merger sequence as it is difficult to probe the time before or after coalescence. We aim to derive how SFR changes in observed mergers throughout the merger sequence, from a statistical perspective. Merger times were estimated for observed galaxy mergers in the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN was trained on mock KiDS images created using IllustrisTNG data. The SFRs were derived from spectral energy density fitting to KiDS and VIKINGs data. To determine the change in SFR for the merging galaxies, each merging galaxy was matched and compared to ten comparable non-merging galaxies; matching redshift, stellar mass, and local density. Mergers see an increase in SFR for galaxies from 300~Myr before the merger until coalescence, continuing until at least 200~Myr after the merger event. After this, there is a possibility that SFR activity in the mergers begins to decrease, but we need more data to better constrain our merger times and SFRs to confirm this. We find that more galaxies with larger stellar mass (M$_{\star}$) have greater SFR enhancement as they merge compared to lower M$_{\star}$ galaxies. There is no clear trend of changing SFR enhancement as local density changes, but the least dense environments have the least SFR enhancement. The increasing SFR enhancement is likely due to closer proximity of galaxies and the presence of more close passes as the time before merger approaches 0~Myr, with SFR slowing 200~Myr after the merger event.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate determination of opacity is critical for understanding radiation transport in both astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. We employ atomic data from R-Matrix calculations to investigate radiative properties in high-energy-density (HED) plasma sources. Specifically, we analyze environments such as the base of the convective zone (BCZ) of the Sun 2 x 10^6$ K, N_e = 10^{23}/cc and the inertial confinement fusion (ICF) device at the Sandia Z facility 2.11 x 10^6 K, N_e = 3.16 x 10^{22}/cc. We calculate Rosseland Mean Opacities (RMO) within a range of temperatures and densities and analyze how they vary under different plasma conditions. In this study, we specifically focus on electron collisional and Stark ion microfield broadening effects on autoionizing resonances in photoabsorption cross sections. Our results are relevant to astrophysical models, particularly in the context of the solar opacity problem, and provide insights into discrepancies between theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. In addition, we investigate the equation-of-state (EOS) and its impact on opacities. In addition, we examine the equation-of-state (EOS) and its impact on opacities of the "chemical picture" Mihalas-Hummer-Dappen EOS with respect to level populations of excited levels included in the R-matrix calculations. This study should contribute to improving opacity models of HED sources such as stellar interiors adn laboratory fusion plasma experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 Glitches in neutron stars originate from the sudden transfer of angular momentum between superfluid components and the observable crust. By modeling this glitch dynamics, including vortex motion, mutual friction, and angular momentum exchange, we can probe the dense matter equation of state. We match theoretical predictions of glitch rise times, overshoot patterns, and relaxation timescales to the well-documented observations of the 2016 Vela glitch. Our model incorporates microphysical parameters such as the mutual friction coefficient $\mathcal{B}$, which in the core arises from electron scattering off magnetized vortices, and in the crust from Kelvin wave excitation during vortex-lattice interactions. Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of the timing residuals reveals detailed glitch dynamics: the crustal superfluid couples on timescales of $\sim100$ seconds, the core exhibits overshoot behavior due to strong central behavior, and the inner crust shows weak entrainment, with $\sim70\%$ of free neutrons remaining superfluid. The modeled rise times are consistent with the observed upper limit of 12.6 seconds, and the observed overshoot requires strong crustal friction but weak core friction, supporting a spatially varying $\mathcal{B}$.These findings highlight the importance of microphysical modeling and demonstrate the potential of future high-cadence timing observations to further constrain the internal dynamics and composition of neutron stars.
