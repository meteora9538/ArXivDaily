 - **Abstract**
 By opening up new avenues to statistically constrain astrophysics and cosmology with large-scale structure observations, the line intensity mapping (LIM) technique calls for novel tools for efficient forward modeling and inference. Implicit likelihood inference (ILI) from semi-numerical simulations provides a powerful setup for investigating a large model parameter space in a data-driven manner, therefore gaining significant recent attention. Using simulations of high-redshift 158$\mu$m [CII] and 88$\mu$m [OIII] LIM signals created by the LIMFAST code, we develop an ILI framework in a case study of learning the physics of early galaxy formation from the auto-power spectra of these lines or their cross-correlation with galaxy surveys. We leverage neural density estimation with normalizing flows to learn the mapping between the simulated power spectra and parameters that characterize the physics governing the star formation efficiency and the $\dot{\Sigma}_{\star}$-$\Sigma_\mathrm{g}$ relation of high-redshift galaxies. Our results show that their partially degenerate effects can be unambiguously constrained when combining [CII] with [OIII] measurements to be made by new-generation mm/sub-mm LIM experiments.
#### GA-NIFS: an extended [OIII] halo around the sub-Eddington quasar J1342+0928 at z=7.54

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (\textit{JWST}) opened a new observational window on the primordial Universe. Here we present new JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy (IFS) observations of the $z=7.54$ quasar ULAS J1342+0928 obtained as part of the Galaxy Assembly with NIRSpec IFS (GA-NIFS) GTO programme. The new data-set obtained with both the prism ($R\sim100$) and the high-resolution grating ($R\sim2700$) allow for a complete description of the quasar emission from the rest-frame UV to optical bands. The low-resolution data reveal the presence of [\ion{O}{iii}] emission on $\sim$7 kpc scales, well above the typical galaxy size at this redshift, likely associated with a past outflow event. Additionally, the high-resolution observations show a more energetic ionised outflow on nuclear scales ($\lesssim 0.6$ kpc). The total ionised mass outflow rate ranges between 50 and 300 $\rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$ where the significant spread is mostly due to the lack of tight constraints on the electron density. This range overlaps in part with the star formation rate range (85--545 $\rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$), implying that the nuclear outflow could ultimately lead to an early star formation quenching. By employing an accretion disc modelling, for the first time on \textit{JWST} data, we manage to robustly estimate the black hole mass and the bolometric luminosity, $\rm \log(M_{BH}/(M_{\odot}))=9.2\pm 0.2$ and $\rm \log(L_{bol}/(erg \, s^{-1}))=46.8\pm 0.1$, respectively. We derive an Eddington ratio of $\rm \lambda_{Edd}\sim 0.4$, challenging the paradigm of widespread super-Eddington accretion in quasars at the epoch of reionisation.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent imaging of supermassive black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has relied on exhaustive parameter-space searches, matching observations to large, precomputed libraries of theoretical models. As observational data become increasingly precise, the limitations of this computationally expensive approach grow more acute, creating a pressing need for more efficient methods. In this work, we present $\texttt{Jipole}$, an automatically differentiable (AD), $\texttt{ipole}$-based code for radiative transfer in curved spacetimes, designed to compute image gradients with respect to underlying model parameters. These gradients quantify how parameter changes-such as the black hole's spin or the observer's inclination-affect the image, enabling more efficient parameter estimation and reducing the number of required images. We validate $\texttt{Jipole}$ against $\texttt{ipole}$ in two analytical tests and then compare pixel-wise intensity derivatives from AD with those from finite-difference methods. We then demonstrate the utility of these gradients by performing parameter recovery for an analytical model using a conjugate gradient optimizer in three increasingly complex cases for the injected image: ideal, blurred, and blurred with added noise. In most cases, high-accuracy fits are obtained in only a few optimization steps, failing only in cases with extremely low signal-to-noise ratios and large blurring size kernels. These results highlight the potential of AD-based methods to accelerate robust, high-fidelity model-data comparisons in current and future black hole imaging efforts.
#### A galactic tug-of-war: how (not) to simultaneously fit the Milky Way satellite luminosity function and the mass-metallicity relation

 - **Abstract**
 The satellite population of the Milky Way is shaped by a range of astrophysical processes including mergers, star formation, feedback, and cosmic reionisation. Determining which processes most strongly influence its properties is challenging and a key test of galaxy formation models. We train a neural network on the GALFORM semi-analytic model and apply a variance-based sensitivity analysis to characterise the influence of 11 astrophysical parameters on two key observables: the satellite luminosity function, and the mass-metallicity relation. We find that: (1) the abundance of bright satellites ($\mathrm{M}_V \lesssim -13$) is regulated primarily by supernova feedback; (2) the faint end of the luminosity function is shaped by the interplay between feedback and reionisation; and (3) the mass-metallicity relation is governed almost exclusively by feedback at all masses. We are unable to find a combination of parameters in the fiducial model that fits the observed data for both statistics simultaneously. To understand why, we employ SHapley Additive exPlanations to capture the directionality of each parameter variation. This enables us to pinpoint the origin of tensions in the model, showing that parameter adjustments that regulate the abundance of faint satellites drive stellar metallicities to be an order of magnitude too low and vice versa. This internal "tug-of-war" leads us to consider extensions to the baseline model, such as metal loading in winds, or allowing the feedback strength to evolve with redshift. Our study highlights the value of interrogating complex physical models through a sensitivity analysis framework by revealing high-order parameter interactions and non-linear responses that traditional one-at-a-time variations would miss.
#### A Pristine Star-Forming Complex at z=4.19

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a faint (M_1700 ~ -12.2), oxygen-deficient strongly-lensed ionizing source -- dubbed LAP2 (Lensed And Pristine 2) -- at a spectroscopic redshift of z=4.19. LAP2 appears to be isolated and lies very close to the caustic produced by the lensing galaxy cluster Abell 2744. It was observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec MSA in prism mode as part of the UNCOVER program. The NIRSpec spectrum reveals prominent Lya emission (7.1 sigma), clear Ha emission (6.2 sigma), tentative Hb emission (2.8 sigma), and no detectable [OIII]4959,5007 (~ 7 times fainter than Ha). The inferred [OIII] 2 sigma upper limit corresponds to an R3 index <0.85 (assuming the Ha/Hb ~ 2.86 case~B recombination ratio), which, under high-ionization conditions, implies a metallicity of Z < 6 X 10^(-3) Z_sun. The combination of faint ultraviolet luminosity, large rest-frame Ha equivalent width (~ 650 A), and extremely compact size (< 10 pc) suggests that LAP2 is being caught in an early, pristine formation phase consistent with an instantaneous-burst scenario, with an estimated stellar mass of at most a few 10^4 Msun. Deep VLT/MUSE observations further reveal copious Lya emission forming an arclet that straddles the critical line. LAP2 thus joins the rare class of extremely metal-poor star-forming complexes that JWST has started to unveil at redshifts 3 - 7, and provides a rare glimpse into a still very poorly explored faint-luminosity regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Following a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, the transient remnant is often a fast-spinning, differentially rotating, magnetised hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). This object is prone to the magnetorotational instability (MRI) which drives magnetohydrodynamic turbulence that significantly influences the HMNS global dynamics. A key consequence of turbulence is the outward transport of angular momentum which impacts the remnant's stability and lifetime. Most numerical simulations of BNS mergers are unable to resolve the MRI due to its inherently small wavelength. To overcome this limitation, subgrid models have been proposed to capture the effects of unresolved small-scale physics in terms of large-scale quantities. We present the first implementation of our MHD-Instability-Induced Turbulence (MInIT) model in global Newtonian simulations of MRI-sensitive, differentially rotating, magnetised neutron stars. Here, we show that by adding the corresponding turbulent stress tensors to the momentum equation, MInIT successfully reproduces the angular momentum transport in neutron stars driven by small-scale turbulence.
#### Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds: Observational Perspectives on Structure, Kinematics, and Lifetime

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze an ensemble of simulated prestellar cores to facilitate interpretation of structure, kinematics, and lifetime of observed cores. While our theory predicts a "characteristic" density for star formation, it also predicts that the individual critical density varies among cores; any observed sample thus contains cores at various evolutionary stages within a given density bin. By analyzing the remaining lifetime, we find cores undergoing quasi-equilibrium collapse evolve on a timescale of twice the freefall time throughout most of their life. Our analysis shows that the central column density and the associated full-width half maximum provide a reasonably accurate observational estimator of the central volume density, and therefore the freefall time; this does, however require resolving the central column density plateau. Observations with a finite beam size tend to underestimate densities of evolved cores, and this makes observed lifetimes appear to decrease more steeply than the apparent freefall time. We measure from our simulations the ratio of prestellar duration to envelope infall time, and find this is consistent with the observed relative number of prestellar cores and embedded protostars. Yet, the absolute core lifetime in our simulations is significantly shorter than would be expected from empirical measurements of the relative numbers of prestellar cores and Class II sources; we discuss several possible reasons for this discrepancy. Finally, our simulated cores have nearly constant line-of-sight velocity dispersion within the emitting region in the sky plane, resembling observed "coherent cores." We show that this "coherence" is a consequence of projection effects, which mask the intrinsic power-law velocity structure function. We discuss possible ways to estimate line-of-sight path lengths.

 - **Abstract**
 The Alfvén surface -- where the solar wind exceeds the local Alfvén speed as it expands into interplanetary space -- is now routinely probed by NASA's Parker Solar Probe (PSP) in the near-Sun environment. The size of the Alfvén surface governs how efficiently the solar wind braking torque causes the Sun to spin-down. We aimed to characterise the size and evolution of the Alfvén surface as magnetic activity increased during solar cycle 25. The Alfvén surface was extrapolated from the solar wind mass and magnetic flux measured by the SWEAP and FIELDS instrument suites onboard PSP. We accounted for the acceleration of the solar wind along Parker spiral magnetic field lines and used potential field source surface modelling to determine the sources of the solar wind. The longitudinally averaged Alfvén radius measured by PSP grew from 11 to 16 solar radii as solar activity increased. Accordingly, the solar wind angular momentum-loss rate grew from $\sim$1.4$\times 10^{30}$ erg to 3$\times 10^{30}$ erg. Both the radial and longitudinal scans of the solar wind contained fluctuations of 10-40\% from the average Alfvén radius in each encounter. Structure in the solar corona influenced the morphology of the Alfvén surface, which was smallest around the heliospheric current sheet and pseudostreamers. The Alfvén surface was highly structured and time-varying however, at large-scales, organised by the coronal magnetic field. The evolution of the solar corona over the solar cycle systematically shifted the magnetic connectivity of PSP and influenced our perception of the Alfvén surface. The Alfvén surface was 30\% larger than both thermally-driven and Alfvén wave-driven wind simulations with the same mass-loss rate and open magnetic flux, but had a similar dependence on the wind magnetisation parameter.
#### AGN-heated dust revealed in "Little Red Dots"

 - **Abstract**
 Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a puzzling population of extragalactic sources whose origin is highly debated. In this Letter, we stack NIRCam, MIRI and ALMA images of a large and homogeneously-selected sample of LRDs from multiple JWST Legacy fields. We find clear evidence for hot-dust emission, seen as a rising mid-infrared continuum up to rest-frame $\lambda_{\rm rest}$$\sim$ 3$\mu$m, that is best explained by a standard dusty AGN structure. This scenario holds regardless of whether the Optical/Ultraviolet (UV) continuum is stellar or AGN-dominated. Either ways, we argue that AGN-heated dust must have a geometry that leaves at least part of the Optical/UV continuum and broad-line region emission unobscured, which explains the observed blue UV slopes and prominent Balmer features. Lack of detections in the deep stack of X-ray images suggests that Compton-thick ($N_{\rm H}$$>$3$\times$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) gas obscuration is common, and likely confined within the dust sublimation radius ($R$$_{\rm sub}$$\sim$0.1 pc). While this gas-dust displacement is in line with recent models (e.g. the ``Black Hole Star''), how pre-enriched hot dust can form around a nearly-pristine black hole environment remains to be explained.
#### Probing the Infrared/Radio correlation of the full IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample with MeerKAT and the VLA

 - **Abstract**
 We study the infrared/radio correlation of galaxies in the IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample using new MeerKAT observations at $\rm\nu = 1.28\, GHz$, complemented with VLA data. We classify the objects by primary energy source (Active Galactic Nuclei vs. Star-Forming) and take into account their merger status. With this, we aim to explore the effect of galaxy-galaxy interaction on the total-infrared (TIR)/radio correlation ($q_\mathrm{TIR}$) of star-forming galaxies by comparing the $q_\mathrm{TIR}$ distribution between isolated and interacting/merging sources. We found the median $q_\mathrm{TIR}$ to be $2.61 \pm 0.01$ (scatter = 0.16) for isolated galaxies and $2.51 \pm 0.08$ (scatter = 0.26) for interacting/merging galaxies. Our analysis reveals that interacting/merging galaxies exhibit lower $q_\mathrm{TIR}$ and higher dispersion compared to isolated galaxies, and the difference is marginally significant. Interacting/merging galaxies have redder $W2-W3$ colours, higher star formation rates (SFR) and specific SFR compared to isolated objects. We observe a significant decrease in $q_\mathrm{TIR}$ with increasing radio luminosity for isolated galaxies. Additionally, we find the median ratio of TIR ($8 \,\mu m < \lambda < 1000\, \mu m$) to far-infrared (FIR; $40 \,\mu m < \lambda < 120\, \mu m$) luminosities to be $\left<L_\mathrm{TIR}/L_\mathrm{FIR}\right>\approx2.29$. By examining the relation between $L_\mathrm{TIR}$ and the mid-infrared (MIR) star-formation rate indicator ($L_\mathrm{12\,\mu m}$) employed for our interacting/merging sample, we note a strong and consistent (similar non-linear behaviour) relationship between the TIR/radio and TIR/MIR ratios. Finally, we show that already at $z<0.1$, $q_\mathrm{TIR}$ exhibits a dependence on stellar mass, with more massive galaxies displaying a lower $q_\mathrm{TIR}$.
#### Unveiling the Impact of Cosmic Rays on the Disc Sizes and Outflows from Dwarf Scales to Galaxy Groups

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs) are a non-thermal energy component in the interstellar and circumgalactic medium (CGM) that can act as an additional feedback channel beyond thermal and kinetic feedback from stars and AGN. They influence galaxy evolution by altering gas properties, regulating star formation, and shaping galactic outflows. We investigate these effects using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations, which incorporate CR transport and feedback on top of the Auriga galaxy formation model. Our simulations span a wide range of halo masses, from dwarf galaxies to small groups ($M_{200\mathrm{c}}= 10^{10} - 10^{13}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$), allowing us to assess the mass-dependent impact of CRs in a cosmological setting. We find that CRs have the strongest impact in lower-mass galaxies ($M_{200\mathrm{c}} < 10^{12}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$), where they suppress star formation rates by up to 50\%, reduce gas and stellar half-light radii, and drive outflows that reach higher velocities at the virial radius compared to simulations without CRs. These CR-enhanced outflows also transport more metals and magnetic fields into the CGM, leading to higher CGM metallicities, stronger magnetisation, and lower CGM temperatures. In more massive galaxies, CRs do not significantly affect star formation or outflow properties, likely because thermal and kinetic feedback from stars and AGN dominate in this regime. However, CRs still influence galaxy morphology across all halo masses by reducing the gas half-mass radius and stellar half-light radius. Finally, variations in CR transport properties, such as different diffusion coefficients or the exclusion of Alfvén cooling, significantly affect star formation, CGM properties, and outflows in lower-mass galaxies. This sensitivity makes these galaxies key environments for testing CR transport models and refining our understanding of their role in galaxy evolution.
#### First look at Vela X-1 with XRISM: A simultaneous campaign with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR

 - **Abstract**
 High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) serve as useful laboratories for exploring the behaviour of accreted matter onto compact objects and for probing the complex wind environments of massive stars. These investigations are essential for understanding stellar life cycles and the dynamics of the Milky Way, and they are prominent topics in the science cases for XRISM and NewAthena. We report, for the first time, a XRISM observation of the HMXB Vela X-1, conducted during the first cycle of the XRISM general observer programme and complemented by simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR coverage. This campaign targeted a critical orbital phase -- when the neutron star is in inferior conjunction -- during which significant changes in absorption are expected. We performed absorption-resolved spectral analyses during two time intervals of interest: the soft and hard hardness ratio (HR) intervals, as it is strongly correlated with absorption variability. We observed a sudden transition in the HR from a soft to a hard state, coinciding with an increase in the absorption column density. This is likely attributed to the onset of the accretion structure crossing our line of sight. With XRISM/Resolve, we also investigated the Fe K region, and we report for the first time the presence of a Fe K$\alpha$ doublet in the spectrum of Vela X-1, together with the presence of already known Fe K$\beta$ and Ni K$\alpha$ lines that are produced in cold clumps embedded in the hot ionised wind. The measured line velocities of the order of $10^2 \ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ are consistent with production sites in the vicinity of the neutron star. This precursor study with Vela X-1 shows the potential of XRISM in studying in unprecedented details the spectral evolution of wind-accreting X-ray binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Dual-phase xenon time projection chambers achieve optimal sensitivity for dark matter in the $10$--$1000~\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ mass range, but sub-GeV dark matter particles lack sufficient energy to produce nuclear recoils above detection thresholds in these detectors. Blazar-boosted dark matter offers a way to overcome this limitation: relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei can accelerate light dark matter in their host-galaxy halos to energies capable of producing detectable nuclear recoil signals in xenon-based detectors on Earth. We present the first blazar-boosted dark matter search incorporating detector response modeling, using public data from XENON1T and LZ for the blazar TXS~0506+056. We model dark matter--proton scattering in the jet environment, covering the full process from jet acceleration to detector response. We explore how the host-galaxy dark matter density profile impacts our analysis. Using XENON1T data, we exclude dark matter--nucleon cross sections for $m_\chi \sim 1~\mathrm{MeV}$ in the range $5.8\times 10^{-31}~\mathrm{cm^2} \lesssim \sigma_{\chi n} \lesssim 6.3\times 10^{-29}~\mathrm{cm^2}$, and using LZ EFT searches we constrain $9.9\times 10^{-32}~\mathrm{cm^2} \lesssim \sigma_{\chi n} \lesssim 2.5\times 10^{-28}~\mathrm{cm^2}$. Our results show that astrophysical uncertainties, especially the dark matter density profile near the supermassive black hole, set the primary limitation on the sensitivity rather than detector systematics. These findings highlight blazar-boosted dark matter as a promising probe of light dark matter and motivate further astrophysical modeling.
#### Cross-correlations between the CLAMATO Lyman-alpha forest and galaxies within the COSMOS field

 - **Abstract**
 We compute the 3D cross-correlation between the absorption of the $z\sim 2.3$ Lyman-alpha forest measured by the COSMOS Lyman-Alpha Mapping And Tomography Observations (CLAMATO) survey, and 1642 foreground galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from several different surveys, including 3D-HST, CLAMATO, zCOSMOS-Deep, MOSDEF, and VUDS. For each survey, we compare the measured cross-correlation with models incorporating the galaxy linear bias as well as observed redshift dispersion and systematic redshift offset. The derived redshift dispersion and offsets are generally consistent with those expected from, e.g., spectroscopic redshifts measured with UV absorption lines or NIR emission lines observed with specific instruments, but we find hints of `fingers-of-god' caused by overdensities in the field. We combine our foreground galaxy sample, and split them into 3 bins of robustly-estimated stellar mass in order to study the stellar mass-halo mass relationship. For sub-samples with median stellar masses of $\log_{10}(M_* / M_\odot) = [9.23,9.71,10.21]$, we find galaxy biases of $b_g\approx [2.9, 3.3,4.7]$, respectively. A comparison with mock measurements from the Bolshoi-Planck $N$-body simulation yields corresponding halo masses of $\log_{10}(M_* / M_\odot) \approx [10.3,11.6,12.1]$ for these stellar mass bins. At the low mass end, our results suggest enhanced star formation histories in mild tension with predictions from previous angular correlation and abundance matching-based observations, and the IllustrisTNG simulation.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the role of baryonic physics in shaping the population, structure, and internal dynamics of galactic subhalos using the Mochima suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations. A refined method is developed to identify bound subhalo material by isolating the local gravitational potential and applying multi-criteria phase-space selection. This approach enables a robust characterisation of subhalo properties across five baryonic runs with varying prescriptions for star formation, and supernova and protostellar feedback, as well as a dark matter-only baseline. At the population level, we find that host halo concentration, modulated by baryonic feedback, is a key predictor of subhalo survival. Subhalos with more massive stellar components exhibit deeper internal potentials and enhanced resilience to tidal disruption. At the structural level, we identify a broad diversity in inner dark matter profiles, consistent with observations of dwarf galaxies. We show that this diversity correlates with both star formation history and environmental interaction. In particular, galaxies that form most of their stars early tend to retain steep cusps, while those with extended or recent star formation exhibit oscillating inner slopes shaped by bursty feedback and tidal perturbations. These findings suggest that the so-called "diversity problem" may reflect the complex interplay between feedback history and gravitational environment, rather than a breakdown of cold dark matter predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 The characterization of exoplanet atmospheres is one of the key topics in modern astrophysics. To date, transmission spectroscopy has been the primary method used, but upcoming instruments will lay the foundation for advancing reflected-light spectroscopy. The main challenge in this area of research is the high contrast ratio between the planet and its star. RISTRETTO, a high-resolution integral-field spectrograph designed for ESO's VLT, aims to address these limitations through a combination of extreme AO, coronagraphy, and high-resolution spectroscopy. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the detectability of the temperate rocky planet Proxima b with RISTRETTO, using realistic end-to-end simulations and a specifically developed data analysis methodology. We created high-resolution star and planet spectra, selecting realistic observational epochs and incorporating the predicted performance of the AO and coronagraphic systems. We implemented noise and spectrograph effects through the Pyechelle spectrograph simulator. We then applied a new methodology to isolate the signal of the planet from the stellar one and proceeded to fit several planetary models in order of increasing complexity. We also introduced a method to determine the sky orientation of the stellar spin axis, which constrains the orientation of the planetary orbit for aligned systems. Assuming an Earth-like atmosphere, our results show that RISTRETTO can detect Proxima b in reflected light in about 55 hours of observing time, offering the ability to characterize the planet orbital inclination, true mass, and broadband albedo. In addition, molecular absorption by O$_2$ and H$_2$O can be detected in about 85 hours of observations. These findings highlight the potential of RISTRETTO to significantly advance the field of exoplanetary science by enabling reflected-light spectroscopy of a sample of nearby exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the distribution and properties of molecular clouds is crucial for tracing the structure and evolution of the interstellar medium and the large-scale morphology of the Milky Way. Here we present an all-sky catalog of 3,345 molecular clouds identified from our previous three-dimensional dust reddening map using a dendrogram-based clustering method with distance-adaptive parameters. The catalog spans heliocentric distances from 90 pc to 4.3 kpc and includes key physical properties for each cloud, including position, size, mass, surface density, and dust density. Approximately 650 clouds in our catalog are associated with the boundary of the Local Bubble, while around 740 clouds (excluding those associated with the Local Bubble) are located at high Galactic latitudes ($|b| > 20^\circ$). The spatial distribution of the cataloged clouds reveals prominent large-scale features in the Galactic disk, including coherent spur-like structures, large-scale cavities, and a more detailed view of the Local Bubble shell. These findings refine our understanding of how molecular clouds trace the Galactic spiral arm network and provide new insight into the spatial structure of the Local Bubble. The catalog serves as a valuable resource for future studies of star formation, Galactic structure, and the interaction between molecular clouds and large-scale ISM features.

 - **Abstract**
 A number of theories have been put forward to explain the bi-modal stellar rotational distribution observed in young massive clusters. These include stellar mergers and interactions induced in binary systems, and the role of angular momentum transfer between a star and its circumstellar disk in its early evolution. Each theory predicts unique rotation distributions in various locations of the colour-magnitude diagram. Specifically, the stellar merger hypothesis posits that the upper end of the main sequence will host a significant number of slowly rotating merger products, essentially that the blue straggler stars are an extension of the blue main sequence. In the present work, we use observations of three massive ($\sim10^5$~\msun) young ($100-300$~Myr) clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud using a combination of HST photometry and VLT/MUSE spectroscopy. We show that in all three clusters, these bright blue stars have stellar rotational distributions that differ significantly from that measured on the blue main sequence. We conclude that stellar mergers do not play a significant role in the formation of the split main sequence/bi-modal rotational distribution. As a corollary, we show that blue straggler stars in these YMCs display a wide range of rotational velocities.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 5253 is a nearby (D=3.6 Mpc) Blue Compact Dwarf galaxy, notable for its three massive young super star clusters (SSCs) and nitrogen enrichment. Its similarity to extreme star-forming galaxies at high redshift makes it a good local analogue for studying chemical enrichment at high spatial resolution. We characterise the ionised gas and dust in the giant HII region in the proximity of the three SSCs in the centre of NGC 5253 using new Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer Narrow Field Mode adaptive optics-assisted data at unprecedented spatial resolution of 0."15$\sim$2.3 pc. We derive the attenuation for the central SSCs and, for the first time, map the extinction parameter ($R_V$) in an extragalactic object. $R_V$ varies among SSCs, suggesting differences in dust physics. Electron temperature and density diagnostics yield flat temperature distributions $T_\mathrm{e,median}$([NII])$=12000 \pm 1700$ K and $T_\mathrm{e,median}$([SIII])$ = 11000 \pm 600$ K, and a structured $n_e$([SII]) of maximum $1930 \pm 40$ cm$^{-3}$. The direct method gives a flat helium abundance ($10^3y^+ = 81 \pm 4$) and uniform oxygen abundance ($12 + \log(\text{O/H}) = 8.22 \pm 0.05$). N/O shows a factor 2-3 enhancement around the SSCs, mapped here for the first time at such high spatial resolution. The total excess nitrogen mass is $\sim$0.3 $M_\odot$, which we estimate is producible by the observed WN-type Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Because there is no direct spatial overlap between the enrichment and WR star positions, the N-rich material appears to have been expelled from the original sites.

 - **Abstract**
 The observed architecture and modeled evolution of close-in exoplanets provide crucial insights into their formation pathways and survival mechanisms. To investigate these fundamental questions, we employed JADE, a comprehensive numerical code that models the coupled evolution of atmospheres and dynamics over secular timescales, rooted in present-day observations. JADE integrates photoevaporation with migration driven by von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) cycles from an external perturber, allowing us to explore evolutionary scenarios where dynamical and atmospheric processes influence each other. Here, we specifically considered GJ 436 b, a warm Neptune with an eccentric orbit and polar spin-orbit angle that has survived within the "hot Neptune desert" despite ongoing atmospheric escape. Our extensive exploration included over 500 000 simulations in a framework that combines precomputed grids with Bayesian inference. This allowed us to constrain GJ 436 b's initial conditions and the properties of its putative companion within a ZLK hypothesis. Our results suggest that GJ 436 b formed at ~ 0.3 AU and, despite its current substantial atmospheric erosion, has experienced minimal cumulative mass loss throughout its history, thanks to a late inward migration triggered by a distant companion inducing ZLK oscillations. We find that initial mutual inclinations of 80° - 100° with this companion best reproduce the observed polar orbit. By combining our explored constraints with radial velocity detection limits, we identified the viable parameter space for the hypothetical GJ 436 c. We found that it strongly disfavors stellar and brown dwarf masses, which offers a useful guide for future observational searches. This work demonstrates how coupled modeling can shed light on the interplay shaping close-in exoplanets and explain the survival of volatile-rich worlds near the edges of the desert.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and star formation rates (SFRs) across cosmic time in the COLIBRE simulations of galaxy formation. COLIBRE includes a multiphase interstellar medium, radiative cooling rates coupled to a model for the evolution of dust grains, and employs prescriptions for stellar and AGN feedback calibrated to reproduce the $z=0$ observed GSMF and stellar mass - size relation. We present the evolution of the GSMF from simulations at three resolutions: $m_{\rm gas}\approx m_{\rm dm}\sim 10^7$, $10^6$, and $10^5~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, in cosmological volumes of up to $400^3$, $200^3$, and $50^3$ cMpc$^3$, respectively. We demonstrate that COLIBRE is consistent with the observed GSMF over the full redshift range for which there are observations to compare with ($0<z<12$), with maximum systematic deviations of $\approx 0.3$ dex reached at $2<z<4$. We also examine the evolution of the star-forming main sequence, cosmic SFR density, stellar mass density, and galaxy quenched fraction, making predictions for both the fiducial COLIBRE model with thermally-driven AGN feedback and its variant with hybrid (thermal + kinetic jet) AGN feedback, and finding good agreement with observations. Notably, we show that COLIBRE matches the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshifts reported by JWST, while predicting a stellar-to-halo mass relation that evolves little with redshift. We conclude that neither a redshift-dependent star formation efficiency, nor a variable stellar initial mass function, nor a deviation from $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ is necessary to reproduce the high-redshift JWST stellar masses and SFRs.
