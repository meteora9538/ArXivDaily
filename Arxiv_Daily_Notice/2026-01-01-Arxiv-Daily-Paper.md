 - **Abstract**
 Dynamics of stellar orbits in dense stellar systems and nuclear star clusters (NSC) with an embedded supermassive black hole (SMBH) is governed a complex interplay of different forces. In particular, star--star gravitational collisions (relaxation), physical collisions between stars, and the hydrodynamical interaction with any surrounding gaseous environment, such as an accretion disk. These processes influence the stellar distribution, the feeding of the central black hole, and the generation of observable phenomena. Furthermore, the self-gravity of the accretion medium modulates the long-term evolution, adding significant complexity to the system's dynamics. By employing elementary arguments we outline the mentioned influences in their mutual competition.

 - **Abstract**
 Study the ionized gas in metal-poor environments is key to understanding the mechanisms regulating galaxy evolution. However, most of the previous studies of extragalactic HII regions rely on unresolved observations of gaseous structures. We study the south-western, spatially resolved, HII region of Leo A, one of the most studied isolated dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. Using archival VIMOS-IFU/VLT data, we explored its gaseous structure through optical emission lines to gain insights into the present-day drivers of gas physics in this dIrr, and we place constraints on the chemical evolution scenario responsible for this low chemical enrichment. The emission line maps reveal that the strongest emission comes from the south-west region. A stratified distribution of ionic species was detected, likely powered by the young star cluster at the nebular centre. HST/ACS data show that the brightest star is in the centre of both the HII region and the star cluster. Photoionization production rates derived indicate that this star can sustain the ionization budget to power the HII region, although subject to the assumed electron density. Using the direct method, we derived a metallicity of $12+\log(\mathrm{O/H})=7.29\pm0.06$ dex, increasing to $7.46\pm0.09$ dex after correcting for temperature fluctuations, placing Leo A in the low-mass end of the MZR. Chemical evolution models suggest that, under constant accretion, the stellar mass growth and metal enrichment over the last 10 Gyr are successfully reproduced by both leaky-box and gas-regulator models. Those results are similar to those found in SagDIG, supporting a picture in which the present-day evolution of Leo A is dominated by stellar feedback processes. The combination of mass loss mechanisms and accretion events reproduces its chemical evolution, suggesting that Leo A has evolved under a gas equilibrium regime across its lifetime.
#### Time-Dependent Accretion Disks with Magnetically Driven Winds: Green's Function Solutions

 - **Abstract**
 We present Green's function solutions for a geometrically thin, one-dimensional Keplerian accretion disk that includes angular momentum extraction and mass loss due to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds. The disk viscosity is assumed to vary radially as $\nu \propto r^{n}$. We derive solutions for three types of boundary conditions applied at the inner radius $r_{\rm in}$: (i) zero torque, (ii) zero mass accretion rate, and (iii) finite torque and finite accretion rate, and investigate the time evolution of a disk with an initial surface density represented by a Dirac-delta function. The mass accretion rate at the inner radius decays with time as $t^{-3/2}$ for $n = 1$ at late times in the absence of winds under the zero-torque condition, consistent with Lynden-Bell \& Pringle (1974), while the presence of winds leads to a steeper decay. All boundary conditions yield identical asymptotic time evolution for the accretion and wind mass-loss rates, though their radial profiles differ near $r_{\rm in}$. Applying our solutions to protoplanetary disks, we find that the disk follows distinct evolutionary tracks in the accretion rate-disk mass plane depending on $\psi$, a dimensionless parameter that regulates the strength of the vertical stress driving the wind, with the disk lifetime decreasing as $\psi$ increases due to enhanced wind-driven mass loss. The inner boundary condition influences the evolution for $\psi < 1$ but becomes negligible at higher $\psi$, indicating that strong magnetically driven winds dominate and limit mass inflow near the boundary. Our Green's function solutions offer a general framework to study the long-term evolution of accretion disks with magnetically driven winds.

 - **Abstract**
 Wide-field rapid sky surveys serve as critical observational methods for time-domain astronomical research. The Antarctic region, with several months of continuous dark nights annually, is an ideal site for time-domain astronomical observations. The Antarctic TianMu Staring Observation Project aims to deploy a fleet of small telescopes, adopting an array observation model to conduct time-domain optical observations in Antarctica, featuring wide-sky coverage, high-cadence sampling, long-period staring, and simultaneous multi-band measurements. Considering the severe challenges optical telescopes face in Antarctica, including extremely low temperatures, unattended operation, and limited power supply and network transmission, we have designed and developed the Antarctic TianMu prototype telescope based on drift-scan charge-coupled device technology. In October 2022, our prototype (with an aperture of 18 cm), named AT-Proto was transported to Zhongshan Station in Antarctica aboard China's 39th Antarctic Research Expedition. It has since operated stably and reliably in the frigid environment for over two years, demonstrating the significant advantages of this technology in polar astronomical observations. The experimental observation results of AT-Proto provide a solid foundation for the subsequent construction of a time-domain astronomy observation array in Antarctica.
#### Self-Gravitating Scalar Field Configurations, Ultra Light Dark Matter and Galactic Scale Observations

 - **Abstract**
 In this thesis, we investigate the possibility that dark matter consists of ultra light spin-zero particles with mass $m \sim 10^{-22}\ \text{eV}$. We focus on the role of self-interactions, assuming all other non-gravitational couplings to Standard Model particles are negligible. Such ultra light dark matter (ULDM) is expected to form stable self-gravitating scalar field configurations (solitons), whose properties depend on the particle mass and self-coupling $\lambda$. Using solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, we explore how galactic-scale observations can constrain $m$ and $\lambda$. We show that observational upper limits on the mass enclosed in central galactic regions can probe both attractive and repulsive self-interactions with strengths $\lambda \sim \pm 10^{-96} - 10^{-95}$. We further demonstrate that self-interactions can allow ULDM to describe observed rotation curves as well as satisfy an empirical soliton-halo mass relation in low surface brightness galaxies for $m \sim 10^{-22}\ \text{eV}$ and $\lambda \gtrsim 10^{-90}$. We also study tidal effects in satellite dwarf galaxies and find that attractive self-interactions can extend their lifetimes over cosmological timescales, allowing ULDM to evade recent constraints derived for the non-interacting case. Finally, we explore machine learning based inference of dark matter and baryonic parameters from galaxy rotation curves, showing that neural networks can recover parameters consistent with observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation is governed by multiple physical processes, making it inherently complicated. One excellent example is the Canis Major OB1/R1 Association, whose complex history of star formation is related to different episodes. Three supernova (SN) events potentially altered the environment and impacted star formation and stellar evolution. Prior investigations revealed two stellar groups of different ages associated with GU CMa and Z CMa. This work focusses on identifying the low-mass young stellar population near FZ CMa, located between these two groups and spatially related to the H II region Sh 2-295. Our main goal is to verify whether this group is age-mixed and characterise its physical properties. We analysed multi-object spectroscopic data acquired with Gemini/GMOS to search for typical features of T Tauri stars (TTs) and to determine their spectral types. Lithium absorption line ($\lambda$ 6708 $\mathring{A}$) was used as a youth indicator, while H$\alpha$ emission was investigated to probe accretion activity. We also derived ages based on optical photometry from Gaia DR3 and compared the projected spatial distribution to diffuse infrared (IR) emission. We identified 29 TTs, including six new members of the association and three Classical TTs (CTTs). The equivalent width of the Li I absorption line suggests an age of $8.1^{+2.1}_{-3.8}$ Myr, while optical photometric data indicate stellar ages ranging from $\sim$1 to 14 Myr. Younger stars are concentrated around Sh 2-295, whereas the older ones are more widely dispersed. We increased the number of known TTs related to the CMa association. Our results support a scenario of multiple star-formation episodes, including a younger group that may have been triggered by the expansion of Sh 2-295. The influence of SN events appears limited in this context.
#### A Convolutional Neural Network for the Recovery of Transfer Functions From Velocity-Resolved Reverberation Mapping Data

 - **Abstract**
 One of the hallmarks of active galactic nuclei are that they are highly variable with time. In watching the spectra vary it has been observed that the emission-lines often appear to "reverberate" -- that is they vary in response to continuum variations assumed to originate close to the black hole. This critical observation underlies the reverberation mapping technique, an elegant physics experiment that has allowed us to characterize the environment around many supermassive black holes in nearby active galactic nuclei. Recent observations are of such quality that the response can be measured as a function of velocity across the emission-line, and in doing so we can construct velocity-delay maps that show the structure and physics of the gas in the broad-line region better than any other measurement to date. Unfortunately constructing such maps requires a deconvolution, and given that the data are often noisy and with gaps such deconvolutions are non-trivial. Here we present a novel deconvolution method for the recovery of velocity-delay maps using a custom convolutional neural network architecture, showcasing that such methods have great promise for the deconvolution of reverberation mapping data products. While we have designed this new method with the BLR in mind, in principle this technique could be applied to any reverberation deconvolution problem, including in the accretion disk and torus.

 - **Abstract**
 Destruction of the interstellar dust proceeds primary behind supernova shocks. The previous estimates of the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed in the SN remnant do not take into account the physical properties of the ambient medium. Here we consider how some parameters, i.e. gas density and metallicity, can influence the destruction of the interstellar dust. We show that there are two regimes of the interstellar dust grains destruction in SN remnants: rapid and almost complete in compact low-mass SN remnants expanding in dense medium, and gradual and weak destruction in massive remnants evolving in the low-dense environment. When time for thermal sputtering is close to the dynamical one, i.e. to the SN remnant age, the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed in the SN remnant reaches its maximum value. We find that change of the ambient gas density results in the reduction of the dust mass logarithmically. We argue that dust cooling suppresses the interstellar dust destruction up to a factor of 1.6 by mass. This factor decreases for higher density of the ambient medium. We found that the dust mass depends linearly on gas metallicity as ${\rm log}~M_d \sim {\rm [Z/H]}$ or, in other words, on the dust-to-gas ratio as $M_d \sim \zeta_d$. In turn, the destruction efficiency is higher in low-metallicity environments due to relatively longer adiabatic phase. We point out that the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed per one SN in a high density environment of the high star formation regions like in local ultraluminous infrared and high-redshift massive galaxies is about several times smaller than that in the Milky Way diffuse medium.

 - **Abstract**
 The Epoch of Reionization marks the last major phase transition in the early Universe, during which the majority of neutral hydrogen once filling the intergalactic medium was ionized by the first galaxies. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space--the escape fraction--remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1--100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will provide a platform for future UV instruments capable of resolving these scales. In this article, we present a science case for understanding how LyC photons escape from star-forming galaxies and define the observational requirements for future instruments aboard HWO, including a UV integral field spectrograph (IFS).
#### Cosmic Himalayas in CROCODILE : Probing the Extreme Quasar Overdensities by Count-in-Cells analysis and Nearest Neighbor Distribution

 - **Abstract**
 The recently reported Cosmic Himalayas (CH) -- an extreme quasar overdensity at z~2 -- poses an apparent challenge to the Lambda CDM framework, with a reported significance of 16.9-sigma under Gaussian assumptions. Such an event appears improbably rare, with a formal probability of P ~ 10^-68. In this work, we investigate whether CH-like structures can naturally arise in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Using the CROCODILE simulation, which self-consistently models galaxy-black hole coevolution, we examine quasar clustering through two complementary approaches: the count-in-cells (CIC) statistic, which probes large-scale overdensities, and the nearest-neighbor distribution (NND), sensitive to small-scale environments. CIC analysis reveals that the underlying distribution is heavy-tailed and non-Gaussian, and that conventional Gaussian-based evaluation substantially overestimates the significance of extreme events. When modeled with an asymmetric generalized normal distribution (AGND), the inferred rarity of the CH is substantially reduced and reconciled with standard Lambda CDM; for instance, regions appearing as 12-sigma outliers under Gaussian assumptions (P ~ 10^-33) are found to occur in the AGND regime with a probability of P ~ 10^-4. NND analysis further demonstrates that extreme overdense regions within the simulation can naturally sustain two-point correlation function values similar to those observed in the CH (r0 ~ 30 Mpc/h), suggesting that the strong clustering stems from sample selection biases and local environmental variations. These two analyses conclusively highlight the importance of adopting non-Gaussian statistics when quantifying extreme overdensities of quasars and establish that the CH is not an anomaly, but a natural outcome of structure formation in the Lambda CDM universe.
#### Towards precision cosmology with Voids x CMB correlations (I): Roman-Agora mock catalogs and pipeline validation

 - **Abstract**
 We construct and validate a set of multi-purpose mock galaxy catalogs designed to capture, to different degrees of accuracy, the main characteristics of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope survey. These catalogs provide a foundation for void statistics and various CMB cross-correlation analyses. Our approach differs from traditional halo occupation or abundance matching methods by directly translating a reference mock catalog -- containing basic properties of the host halos -- into a new simulation (in our case Agora). This technique, which we call analog matching, assigns a halo counterpart in the new simulation to each reference galaxy through a nearest-neighbor search in a multi-dimensional parameter space. This space can include halo mass, environmental measures and other galaxy-specific attributes. By varying the composition of this parameter vector, we can generate catalogs of differing complexity and conduct systematic tests to examine the influence of modelling choices on LSS statistics. We find that analog matching based on halo mass alone, or halo mass and galaxy-type indicators, successfully reproduces the expected Roman emission-line galaxy statistics. We also show that reproducing two-dimensional galaxy clustering does not guarantee consistent void properties. Our results highlight the importance of matching void statistics for improved mock accuracy, and demonstrate that measuring voids provides independent and sensitive constraints on galaxy-halo connections beyond the matter power spectrum. An important by-product of our setup is that it is fully general and can be applied to any combination of simulation and reference catalog, provided that the desired parameter space for both is specified. The resulting Roman-Agora mock catalogs offer a versatile resource for LSS x CMB studies and a benchmark for assessing the impact of mock accuracy on cosmological observables.
