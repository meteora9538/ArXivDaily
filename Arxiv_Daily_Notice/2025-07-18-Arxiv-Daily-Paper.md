 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of an environment-dependent galaxy-wide stellar initial mass function (gwIMF) on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR). The integrated galaxy-wide IMF (IGIMF) theory, which incorporates variations in stellar populations due to star formation history (SFH) and metallicity, provides a more accurate framework for understanding systematic deviations in galaxy scaling relations than that given by an invariant gwIMF. By considering how the mass-to-light ratio of the stellar population is influenced by metallicity and SFH, we show that high-mass galaxies have their masses in stars and remnants underestimated under the assumption of a constant mass-to-light ratio. In contrast, low-mass, gas-dominated galaxies are less affected. Our results suggest that the discrepancies between the true and observed BTFR are primarily driven by the evolving nature of the stellar IMF, particularly in galaxies with slowly declining SFHs. The IGIMF theory offers a solution to the observed offsets in the BTFR, especially for high-mass galaxies, where the rotational velocities are higher than predicted by MOND. We conclude that incorporating the IGIMF provides a more accurate description of galaxy dynamics, revealing the importance of stellar population characteristics in refining our understanding of the baryonic mass-velocity relationship. This study underscores the necessity of accounting for the variation of the gwIMF when interpreting the BTFR, particularly in the context of alternative gravitational theories like MOND.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the previously unexplored role of magnetic fields in the formation of second-generation (SG) stars in proto-globular clusters (GCs) using 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamical simulations. This study is based on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) scenario and incorporates photoionization feedback and stellar winds from AGB stars. We model SG formation within a young ($34$ Myr) massive ($10^6 $ Msun) proto-GC moving through a magnetized, homogeneous interstellar medium. Our results indicate that variations in magnetic field strength and orientation significantly influence the gas geometry and SG star-forming regions around the cluster. Overall, magnetic fields limit SG formation to the very center of the cluster, with stronger magnetic fields tending to form more compact SG clusters. For magnetic field strengths of $0.5$ and $5$ microG, we observe no substantial changes in the mass of formed SG stars. However, with a strong $50$ microG field, we see a $25$ percent increase or a $70$ percent decrease in total SG mass, for a field aligned parallel or perpendicular to the cluster's motion, respectively. This variation reflects how magnetic fields influence gas accretion, as our results suggest that gas accreted from the interstellar medium (ISM) slightly dominates over AGB ejecta in the cluster, except in cases of strong perpendicular fields, where gas accretion is efficiently suppressed. Additionally, stronger magnetic fields limit the cluster's ability to retain its ejecta, leading to the formation of stars with lower helium abundances. On the other hand, a strong perpendicular magnetic field produces SG stars that originate from AGB ejecta and exhibit the highest helium abundances.

 - **Abstract**
 Using direct $N$-body simulations, we investigate the initial conditions and evolution of a star-forming region resembling the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) with the advanced \textsc{NBODY6} code. By varying the initial conditions, we aim to identify a model that closely aligns with observed parameters such as the half-mass radius, core radius, and total mass. Additionally, we examine the cluster's evolution over 800 Myr to determine whether it could reproduce the present-day properties of the Pleiades and Hyades along its evolutionary path. Under the influence of a Milky Way-like tidal field, the ONC experiences significant mass loss, primarily due to rapid gas expulsion, retaining approximately 47\% of its initial 4200 stars by about 100 Myr and only 9\% by about 700 Myr. These evolutionary stages closely match the properties of the Pleiades and Hyades, suggesting that an ONC-like cluster may have been their precursor. Additional models with varying degrees of primordial mass segregation indicate that the ONC likely had an initial half-mass radius of 0.2-0.3 pc, a total mass of 1200 - 2000 M$_\odot$, and a high degree of mass segregation. Models with an initial stellar count of about $N_{\text{in}} \approx 4 \times 10^3 - 5 \times 10^3$, rich in binaries and exhibiting mass segregation, show excellent agreement with observed cluster properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Temperate sub-Neptunes are compelling targets for detecting liquid-water oceans beyond the Solar System. If water-rich and lacking massive hydrogen-helium envelopes, these planets could sustain liquid layers beneath their atmospheres despite sizes larger than Earth. Previous observations of the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b revealed an H2-dominated atmosphere rich in CH4, with moderate evidence for CO2 and tentative signs of dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Here we present four new JWST/NIRSpec transit observations of K2-18 b. The resulting high-precision transmission spectrum robustly detects both CH4 and CO2, precisely measuring their abundances and firmly establishing the planet's water-rich nature: either a thick envelope with >10% H2O by volume or a thin atmosphere above a liquid-water ocean. The spectrum reveals no detectable H2O, NH3, or CO. The absence of atmospheric water vapor suggests an efficient cold trap, while the nondetections of NH3 and CO support the scenario of a small H2-rich atmosphere overlying a liquid reservoir. However, alternative models that include these gases can also reproduce the spectrum within uncertainties, highlighting the need for deeper observations. The spectrum only contains marginal signals of DMS, methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), and nitrous oxide (N2O), with none exceeding 3 sigma in model preference and all falling below ~2 sigma without imposing a strong super-Rayleigh haze. Meanwhile, our self-consistent photochemical models show that DMS and CH3SH may form abiotically in massive H2-rich atmospheres of high metallicity, making it important to consider additional indicators for their potential use as biosignatures. K2-18 b, a cool, water-rich world, stands out as one of the most promising temperate sub-Neptunes for exploring the emergence of liquid-water environments in non-Earth-like planets, motivating further characterization of its atmosphere and interior.

 - **Abstract**
 The circular speed curve of the Milky Way provides a key constraint on its mass distribution, reflecting the axisymmetric component of the gravitational potential. This is especially critical in the inner Galaxy ($R \lesssim 4$ kpc), where non-axisymmetric structures such as the stellar bar and nuclear stellar disk strongly influence dynamics. However, significant discrepancies remain between circular speed curves inferred from stellar dynamical modeling and those derived from the terminal-velocity method applied to gas kinematics. To investigate this, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including cooling, heating, star formation, and feedback, under a realistic gravitational potential derived from stellar dynamical models calibrated to observational data. This potential includes the Galactic bar, stellar disks, dark matter halo, nuclear stellar disk, and nuclear star cluster. We generate synthetic longitude-velocity ($l$-$v$) diagrams and apply the terminal-velocity method to derive circular speeds. The simulated gas reproduces the observed terminal-velocity envelope, including a steep inner rise. We find this feature arises from bar-driven non-circular motions, which cause the terminal-velocity method to overestimate circular speeds by up to a factor of 2 at $R \sim 0.4$ kpc, and enclosed mass by up to a factor of 4. These results suggest that inner gas-based rotation curves can significantly overestimate central mass concentrations. The steep inner rise in gas-derived circular speeds does not require a massive classical bulge but can be explained by bar-induced streaming motions. Rather than proposing a new mechanism, our study provides a clear, Milky Way-specific demonstration of this effect, emphasizing the importance of dynamical modeling that explicitly includes non-circular motions for accurate mass inference in the inner Milky Way.
#### Fine-structure Line Atlas for Multi-wavelength Extragalactic Study (FLAMES) III: [C II] as Tracer, Crisis of SFR, [O III]/[C II] at High-z, New Answers and New Questions

 - **Abstract**
 In the final paper of this series, we discuss new perspectives and challenges in the study of interstellar medium (ISM), leveraging comprehensive catalogs and physical insights presented in our previous papers. We focus on key questions of far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure lines (FSLs): their origins, diagnostic value, and implications of correlations. Our analysis reveals a strong dependence on elemental abundance, so that FSL/H$\alpha$ traces metallicity, [N II]/[C II] traces N/O, and $\sim$80% of [C II] emission arises from neutral gas without systematic variations. We conclude a coherence exists between the emissions from ionized and neutral gases regarding energy sources and distribution. We argue that [C II] is physically a metallicity-dependent star formation rate (SFR) tracer, while its correlations with atomic or molecular gas masses are secondary. Crucially, the [C II] ``deficit'' is only part of a universal ``deficit'' problem that shows in all neutral and ionized gas lines including extinction-corrected H$\alpha$, caused by infrared (IR) luminosities and characterized by a dichotomy in gas and dust behaviors. This universal ``deficit'' marks a breakdown of the obscuration-corrected star-formation rate (SFR) calibration and imperils SFR estimates. We argue that it is caused by either IR ``excess'' or ionized gas ``deficit'', and present possible scenarios. A renewed picture of ISM structure is needed to reconcile with ionized--neutral gas coherence, metallicity dependence, and gas--dust dichotomy. We also discuss differences of FIR FSL at high redshifts: the offset in ``deficit'' trends, the similar [O III]/[C II] in metal-poor galaxies, and elevated [O III]/[C II] in dusty galaxies.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12912

 - **Abstract**
 Context: HD 49798 is a bright ($m_{\rm V} = 8.287$), hot (effective temperature $T_{\rm eff} = 45000$ K) subdwarf star of the spectral type O (sdO). It is the only confirmed sdO-type mass-donor star of an X-ray binary that has a high-mass (1.28 $M_\odot$) white-dwarf or neutron-star primary with a spin period of only 13.2 s. Aims: Since a high-quality spectrum of HD 49798, obtained with the Tübingen Ultraviolet Echelle Spectrometer (TUES), that has never been analyzed before is available in the database of the Orbiting and Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (ORFEUS), we performed a spectral analysis based on observations from the far ultraviolet (FUV) to the optical wavelength range. Methods: We used advanced non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model atmospheres of the Tuebingen Model-Atmosphere Package (TMAP) to determine the effective temperature, the surface gravity ($\log g$), and the abundances of those elements that exhibit lines in the available observed spectra. Results: We determined $T_{\rm eff} = 45000 \pm 1000$ K, log (g / cm/s$^2$) = $4.46 \pm 0.10$, and re-analyzed the previously determined photospheric abundances of H, He, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, Fe, and Ni. For the first time, we measured the abundances of C, Ne, P, S, Cr, and Mn. Conclusons: Our panchromatic spectral analysis of HD 49798 -- from the FUV to the optical -- allowed to reduce the error limits of the photospheric parameters and to precisely measure the metal abundances. HD 49798 is a stripped, intermediate-mass (zero-age main sequence mass of about 7.15 $M_\odot$) He star with a mass of 1.14(+0.30/-0.24) $M_\odot$. At its surface it exhibits abundances that are the result of CNO-cycle and 3 alpha burning nucleosynthesis as well as enhanced Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni abundances.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence plays a critical role in regulating star formation in molecular clouds and is also observed in simulations of primordial halos that host Population III (Pop III) stars. The relative velocity between baryons and dark matter at the time of recombination is thought to be a source of turbulence in the early universe. In this paper, we study how this stream velocity affects the turbulence inside primordial halos using high-resolution cosmological simulations across the redshift range of $z = 30$ to $z = 20$. We find that at a fixed redshift, the stream velocity enhances turbulence in low-mass halos ($M \lesssim 10^6 \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$) and suppresses it for high-mass halos ($M \gtrsim 10^6 \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$). The enhancement in low-mass halos likely arises from residual kinetic energy introduced by the stream velocity, while the suppression in high-mass halos likely arises from a reduction in inflowing accretion-driven turbulence. This mass-dependent modulation of turbulence suggests that the initial conditions inside primordial halos are altered in the presence of the stream velocity, potentially influencing their fragmentation and the resulting star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Young Massive Star Clusters, long considered as potentially important sources of galactic cosmic rays, have recently emerged as gamma-ray emitters up to very high energies. Aims. In order to quantify the contribution of this source class to the pool of Galactic CRs, we need to estimate the typical acceleration efficiency of these systems. Methods. We search for emission in the GeV band, as most of the energy is emitted in this band. We perform an analysis of Fermi-LAT data collected towards the M16 region, a star-forming region also known as the Eagle Nebula, which hosts the Young Massive Star Cluster NGC 6611. We model the acceleration at the stellar wind termination shock and the propagation through the wind-blown bubble to derive the energetics of the process and interpret the GeV observations. Results. We find significant GeV emission in correspondence of a molecular cloud associated to the Young Massive Star Cluster NGC 6611. We interpret this as hadronic emission associated to particle accelerated at the cluster wind termination shock and propagated through the low-density wind-excavated bubble to the cloud. Our modeling allows us to put firm constraints on the acceleration efficiency in NGC 6611, assessing it between $\sim$ 1 % and $\sim$ 4 %.

 - **Abstract**
 The precise insertion of CubeSats into designated orbits is a complex task, primarily due to the limited propulsion capabilities and constrained fuel reserves onboard, which severely restrict the scope for large orbital corrections. This limitation necessitates the development of more efficient maneuvering techniques to ensure mission success. In this paper, we propose a maneuvering sequence that exploits the natural J2 perturbation caused by the Earth's oblateness. By utilizing the secular effects of this perturbation, it is possible to passively influence key orbital parameters such as the argument of perigee and the right ascension of the ascending node, thereby reducing the need for extensive propulsion-based corrections. The approach is designed to optimize the CubeSat's orbital insertion and minimize the total fuel required for trajectory adjustments, making it particularly suitable for fuel-constrained missions. The proposed methodology is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations that examine different initial orbital conditions and perturbation environments. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the J2-augmented strategy in achieving accurate orbital insertion, showing a major reduction in fuel consumption compared to traditional methods. The results underscore the potential of this approach to extend the operational life and capabilities of CubeSats, offering a viable solution for future low-Earth orbit missions.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST highlighted an excess of UV-bright galaxies at z>10, with a derived UVLF that exhibits a softer evolution than expected. In this work, we aim at characterizing the burstiness level of high-redshift galaxy SFHs and its evolution. We implement a stochastic SFH module in CIGALE using power spectrum densities, to estimate the burstiness level of star formation in galaxies at 6<z<12. We find that SFHs with a high level of stochasticity better reproduce the SEDs of z>6 galaxies, while smoother assumptions introduce biases when applied to galaxies with bursty star-formation activity. The assumed stochasticity level of the SFH also affects the constraints on galaxies' physical properties, including the main sequence. Successively assuming different levels of burstiness, we determined the best-suited SFH for each 6<z<12 galaxy in the JADES sample from a Bayes Factor analysis. Galaxies are classified according to their level of burstiness, and the corresponding physical properties are associated to them. For massive galaxies (log Mstar/Msun> 8.8), the fraction of bursty galaxies increases from 0.42+/-0.08 to 0.76+/-0.20 from z=6 to 12, respectively. At all redshifts, only <20% of low-mass galaxies are classified as bursty, due to their faintness resulting in low S/N. For bursty galaxies, the log10(SFR10/SFR100) ratio, another indicator of bursty star formation, does not evolve with redshift, but the fraction of galaxies with high log10(SFR10/SFR100) slightly increases from 0.25+/-0.06 to 0.37+/-0.11 between z=6 and z=9. We include additional constraints from observations on sigmaUV and SFE, finding a maximum of 0.72+/-0.02 mag and 0.06+/-0.01, for sigmaUV and SFE, respectively. This confirms that neither alone is responsible for the weak evolution of the UVLF at z>10. Our results add further evidence that a combination with other mechanisms is likely responsible for the high-z UVLF.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a powerful tool for probing the structure of the innermost accretion flow and corona around supermassive black holes. RE~J1034+396, the most prominent AGN known to host an X-ray QPO, exhibits both short-term and long-term QPO evolution, offering a unique opportunity to investigate accretion disk and corona physics through its temporal behavior. We report a possible long-term ($\sim 92.2$ days) cyclic evolution of the QPO in RE~J1034+396, joining the detected QPO ($\sim 3730$ s) and its short-term ($\sim 17$ ks) modulation to form a possible QPO triplet, which is potentially the first such structure identified in an AGN. By applying the relativistic precession model to the QPO triplet, we constrain the black hole mass to $1.7^{+0.9}_{-0.8} \times 10^{6}\ M_\odot$, consistent with independent estimates, and find a low dimensionless black hole spin of $0.017^{+0.028}_{-0.012}$. We propose an exploratory model that involves a quasiperiodic ultra-fast outflow (UFO) within the framework of the relativistic precession model, explaining the QPO lag reversal, the modulation of hard-band QPO amplitude by soft-band flux, and the long-term evolution of timing properties. Supporting evidence includes blueshifted emission and absorption lines indicating a strong UFO at $\sim 0.3c$. This work provides new insights into the inner regions of AGN accretion disks and motivates further efforts in both numerical modeling and high-cadence timing observations.
#### Unraveling the Feedback-Regulated Star Formation Activities around the Expanding Galactic MIR Bubble [HKS2019] E71

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the physical environment of the Galactic mid-infrared (MIR) bubble [HKS2019] E71 (hereafter E71) through a multi-wavelength approach. E71 is located at the edge of a filamentary structure, as traced in Herschel images (250-500 $\mu$m), Herschel column density map, and molecular maps in the velocity range [-20,-14] km/s. It hosts a stellar cluster (radius~1.26 pc, distance~1.81+/-0.15 kpc) associated with radio continuum emission, including a centrally positioned B1.5-type massive star (hereafter 'm2'), along with an enhanced population of evolved low-mass stars and young stellar objects. MIR images and molecular line maps reveal a PDR surrounding 'm2', exhibiting an arc-like structure along the edges of E71. Regularly spaced molecular and dust condensations are identified along this structure. The position-velocity map of 12CO emission suggests an expansion of molecular gas concentrated at the periphery of E71. Near-infrared spectroscopic observations with TANSPEC confirm the presence of the accretion process in a massive young stellar object (MYSO) located near the edge of the bubble. High-resolution uGMRT radio continuum maps uncover substructures in the ionized emission, both toward the MYSO and the center of E71. These findings support that 'm2' has shaped an arc-like morphology through its feedback processes. The pressure exerted by 'm2' and the velocity structure of the 12/13CO(1-0) emission suggest that the stellar feedback has likely driven out molecular material, leading to the formation of the expanding E71 bubble. Our overall investigation infers that the "collect and collapse" process might be a possible mechanism that can describe the ongoing star formation activities around the E71 bubble.

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep HST imaging of one of the nearest ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) outside of the Local Group: F8D1, a satellite of M81 known to be tidally disrupting. UDGs are an enigmatic and diverse population, with evolutionary pathways ranging from tidal processing to bursty feedback and high initial angular momentum. To determine F8D1's evolutionary drivers, we resolve stars in F8D1's central $\sim$1 kpc and in a parallel field $\sim$6 kpc along its major axis to deep photometric limits, reaching below the Red Clump. We also image eight shallower fields along F8D1's major and minor axes. We calculate the star formation history (SFH) in the two deep fields, finding that while currently quiescent, both regions experienced a substantial burst $\sim$2 Gyr ago and a smaller burst $\sim$500 Myr ago, which likely formed F8D1's nuclear star cluster. In the shallow fields, using the ratio of evolved Asymptotic Giant Branch and Red Giant Branch stars out to $\sim$13 kpc along F8D1's known stellar stream, we confirm that F8D1 was globally star-forming until at least 2 Gyr ago. We estimate a total progenitor stellar mass, including the stream, of $\sim$1.3$\times$10$^8\ M_{\odot}$, with an average [M/H] $\sim$ $-$0.8. We compare F8D1's properties to those of Local Group galaxies with similar initial stellar mass. We find that F8D1 is consistent with a progenitor star-forming galaxy similar to NGC 6822, which is in the midst of a transition to a Sagittarius-like system. Notably, this evolutionary sequence can be accomplished through tidal processing alone, in galaxies that have experienced sufficiently bursty feedback to create cored profiles.
