 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies have revealed that bars can form as early as a few billion years after the Big Bang, already displaying similar characteristics of evolved bars in the Local Universe. Bars redistribute angular momentum across the galaxy, regulating star formation, AGN activity, and building new stellar structures such as nuclear discs. However, the effects of bar-driven evolution on young galaxies are not yet known, as no evidence of bar-built stellar structures has ever been found beyond $z = 1$, until now. In this work, we show evidence of a bar-built, star-forming nuclear disc, already present at redshift $z = 1.5$. This is the first evidence of a bar-built stellar structure at Cosmic Noon. We find that this nuclear disc is actively forming stars and has the same size as some nuclear discs in nearby galaxies. This evidence solidifies the now emerging picture in which bars are fundamental not only in the late evolution of galaxies, but also in their early evolutionary stages. It changes the current paradigm by urging a revision of our picture of galaxy evolution beyond redshift one, to include new considerations on the role played by bars as early as a few billion years after the Big Bang.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic globular clusters (GCs) were born shortly after the Big Bang. For such old stellar systems the initial mass function (IMF) at the high mass regime can never be observed directly, because stars more massive than about 1 Mo have evolved since longtime. However, the hydrostatic to explosive alpha-element ratio (HEx ratio) offers a way to bypass the lack of observable high mass stars through the yields that massive stars released when exploding as supernovae, incorporated in the stars we presently observe in GCs. The HEx ratio measures the percentage of high mass stars over the total number of stars exploding as supernovae and it is an efficient probe of the ephemeral first phases of the GC evolution. We exploited a recently completed survey to assemble a dataset of very homogeneous abundances of alpha-elements in 27 GCs from [Fe/H]~ -2.4 to ~ -0.3 dex. In agreement with previous results from APOGEE, we confirm that the HEx ratio is indistinguishable for GCs formed in situ and accreted in the Galaxy, and that this ratio decreases with increasing metallicity. However, we posit that this trend is better explained by a metallicity-dependent IMF deficient in the highest mass stars at high metallicity, as corroborated by the declining [O/Mg] ratio as a function of the [Mg/H] ratio. At odds with the previous analysis based on APOGEE data, we detect an anti-correlation of HEx ratio with both present day and initial GC masses. Finally, we hypothesise that in that analysis, the stars of the GC M 54 were probably confused with stars in the core of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, where the cluster is presently immersed.
#### Testing the inference of kinematics from mock JWST NIRSpec/MSA observations of TNG50 galaxies at $z\sim2-6$

 - **Abstract**
 We use the TNG50 galaxy formation simulation to generate mock JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec microshutter array (MSA) observations of H$\alpha$-emitting gas in $M_*=10^8-10^{11.5}\,M_\odot$ star-forming galaxies at $z=2-6$. We measure morphological properties from the mock imaging through Sersic profile fitting, and gas rotational velocities ($v$) and velocity dispersions ($\sigma$) by fitting the mock spectra as thin, rotating discs. To test the efficacy of such simple parametric models in describing complex ionised gas kinematics, we compare the best-fit quantities to intrinsic simulation measurements. At $z=3$, we find that $v$ and $\sigma$ for aligned and resolved sources generally agree well with intrinsic measurements, within a factor of $\sim$2 and $\sim$1.5, respectively. The recovery of kinematics is robust for smooth, disc-like systems, but $v$ and $\sigma$ can be over- or underestimated by more than a factor of 2, respectively, for intrinsically elongated systems. The scatter in the recovery accuracy is larger at higher redshift, as TNG50 galaxies at $z>3$ deviate more strongly from the thin rotating disc assumption. Despite uncertain measurements for individual galaxies, we find that key population trends, such as the weak redshift evolution of $\sigma$ and $v/\sigma$ as well as the dependence of $\sigma$ on the global star formation rate, are broadly recovered by our kinematic modelling. Our work provides the end-to-end framework needed to compare NIRSpec MSA observations to cosmological simulations and to quantify observational biases in measuring ionised gas kinematics, highlighting the need for the development of dedicated models for high-redshift galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present multiwavelength observations and analysis of six luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) discovered in Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey data. We identified these LFBOTs from their fast light-curve evolution ($t_{1/2}\leq 12 $d), blue colors at peak brightness ($g-r\leq-0.5 $mag), a visible host galaxy, high optical luminosity ($M_g<-20$), and an X-ray or radio detection. With the exception of AT2024aehp (ZTF24abygbss), these transients exhibit peaks in their $10\,$GHz radio light curves at $t_{\text{rest}} \approx 50-100$ d, with peak radio luminosities ranging from $10^{38}-10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Modeling the radio emission as synchrotron radiation indicates a fast ($v=0.1-0.3c$) shock in a dense ($n_e\approx10^{3}-10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$) medium. The X-ray emission varies by $\approx2$ orders of magnitude in luminosity ($10^{42}-10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) at $t_{\text{rest}}\sim20 $d. Analysis of the host-galaxy photometry and spectroscopy for each transient shows that they are predominantly nonnuclear (a few kpc offset) with star-forming host galaxies of stellar masses $10^{9}-10^{11} ,M_\odot$. Unlike all other LFBOTs to date, AT2024aehp exhibited a luminous ($M<-19 $mag) plateau in the optical light curve; spectra during this plateau phase showed a featureless blue continuum. The $6-15$ GHz radio emission of AT2024aehp brightened by over an order of magnitude from $t_{\text{rest}} \approx70 $d to $t_{\mathrm{rest}} \approx130 $d. The mostly consistent radio behavior between optically selected LFBOTs implies a similar circumburst medium, leading us to prefer a progenitor scenario in which mass is lost in a consistent way shortly prior to the terminal event, such as a massive star merging with a compact object.

 - **Abstract**
 Using a combination of \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} and \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} imaging, a runaway supermassive black hole (RBH-1) was recently identified with an inferred velocity of $954^{+110}_{-126}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, likely ejected from a compact star-forming galaxy (denoted as GX) at $z \approx 0.96$. Assuming the runaway black hole was the outcome of the gravitational-wave-driven merger of two black holes, we use its measured runaway velocity together with gravitational-wave recoil predictions from numerical relativity and black hole perturbation theory to constrain the mass ratio and spin configuration of the progenitor SMBHs that overcame the final-parsec problem and merged $\sim 70$~Myr ago. We find that the progenitor binary must have been precessing, with a mass ratio $m_1/m_2\lesssim 6$, and that the more massive SMBH must have possessed a high spin (dimensionless spin magnitude $\sim 0.75$) in order to generate a recoil of this magnitude. This has important astrophysical implications as similar SMBH mergers can be an interesting source population for the upcoming LISA mission with signal-to-noise ratios $\gtrsim$ 1000. Furthermore, the progenitor SMBH properties imply that GX was likely formed through a major, gas-rich (``wet'') merger between two galaxies of comparable mass, with a mass ratio $\lesssim 4$.
#### High resolution observations of 'dark' neutral hydrogen clouds in the Virgo cluster with the Very Large Array

 - **Abstract**
 We have observed six `dark' neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds discovered in the Virgo cluster by the Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey (AGES) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), giving higher angular and velocity resolution than the original AGES observations. We detected compact HI emission in two of the sources, AGESVC1 231 and AGESVC1 274, allowing us to firmly associate them with faint ($m_g > 18.5$), blue ($g-i < 0.1$) optical counterparts with high $M_{HI}/L_g$ ratios. In a further two sources, we detected low column-density extended HI emission, consistent with these being dispersing clouds from ram-pressure stripping or tidal interactions. The final two sources were not detected with the VLA, allowing us to set low column-density limits on the HI detected by AGES that are consistent with these clouds also being formed from HI that is dispersing into the intra-cluster medium. The four HI sources not associated with optical counterparts thus appear likely to be relatively short-lived objects. No evidence was found for either pressure-supported turbulent spheres or stable dark galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Particle acceleration in relativistic collisionless shocks remains an open problem in high-energy astrophysics. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations predict that electron acceleration in weakly magnetized shocks proceeds via small-angle scattering, leading to a maximum electron energy significantly below the Bohm limit. This upper bound manifests observationally as a characteristic synchrotron cutoff, providing a direct probe of the underlying acceleration physics. Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows offer an exceptional laboratory for testing these predictions. Here, we model the spectral evolution of GRB afterglows during the relativistic deceleration phase, incorporating PIC-motivated acceleration prescriptions and self-consistently computing synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission. We find that low-energy bursts in low-density environments, typical of short GRBs, exhibit a pronounced synchrotron cutoff in the GeV band within minutes to hours after the trigger. Applying our framework to GRB 190114C and GRB 130427A, we find that current observations are insufficient to discriminate between PIC-motivated acceleration and the Bohm limit, primarily due to large uncertainties in the Fermi-LAT band. Nevertheless, future MeV-TeV afterglow observations can break model degeneracies and place substantially tighter constraints on particle acceleration in relativistic shocks.

 - **Abstract**
 We numerically study the Q-ball formation triggered by a cosmological first-order phase transition within the Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model. By performing lattice simulations, we track the nonequilibrium dynamics throughout the transition, providing a precise description of the Q-ball formation mechanism and the resulting mass spectrum. Collapsing false-vacuum regions first form thermal balls, which subsequently cool via dissipative interactions and stabilize into long-lived Q-balls with nonzero spin. We observe a large population of low-mass Q-balls, as well as rare, massive Q-balls that are several times larger than the analytical prediction. The final Q-ball population exhibits a broad mass spectrum spanning over two orders of magnitude, characterized by an exponential tail of number density at large masses. The simulations suggest that the Q-ball abundance is approximately $50\%$ higher than predicted by analytical estimates, adjusting the result in the context of Q-balls as dark matter candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite the assumption that an ideal FLRW observer is not dependent on the local environment, observations are biased by the positions of the observers due to the matter correlations in the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. The variation of the mass distribution of the LSS of the universe implies that observers residing in different locations may suffer bias in their measurements when they look at the images of distant galaxies. Here, we assess the influence of the local environment on weak gravitational lensing (WL) shear statistics in the context of relativistic $N$-body code, \texttt{gevolution}. We derive numerical constraints on the cosmological parameters from the WL shear angular power spectrum and comment on the local environment's influence on WL shear. We find tighter constraints on the parameter $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ above redshift $z$ = 0.2, which implies over this redshift the local environment's impact is minor. We also investigate the bispectrum and conclude that on average the impact of the local environment on $f_{\rm NL}$ (a measure of non-Gaussianities) is minimal and consistent with zero effect. However, we find that within the assembly of all possible observers/locations, there will also be a few that could infer the parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ of the order 10. These results could thus be used to estimate the uncertainty in the inference of cosmological parameters such as $f_{\rm NL}$ based on WL shear bispectrum and thus may have implications for future surveys requiring precision at the percent level.

 - **Abstract**
 Kinetic temperature is a fundamental parameter in molecular clouds. Symmetric top molecules, such as NH$_3$ and CH$_3$CCH, are often used as thermometers. However, at high temperatures, NH$_3$(2,2) can be collisionally excited to NH$_3$(2,1) and rapidly decay to NH$_3$(1,1), which can lead to an underestimation of the kinetic temperature when using rotation temperatures derived from NH$_3$(1,1) and NH$_3$(2,2). In contrast, CH$_3$CCH is a symmetric top molecule with lower critical densities of its rotational levels than those of NH$_3$, which can be thermalized close to the kinetic temperature at relatively low densities of about 10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$. To compare the rotation temperatures derived from NH$_3$(1,1)$\&$(2,2) and CH$_3$CCH rotational levels in warm molecular gas, we used observational data toward 55 massive star-forming regions obtained with Yebes 40m and TMRT 65m. Our results show that rotation temperatures derived from NH$_3$(1,1)$\&$(2,2) are systematically lower than those from CH$_3$CCH 5-4. This suggests that CH$_3$CCH rotational lines with the same $J$+1$\rightarrow$$J$ quantum number may be a more reliable thermometer than NH$_3$(1,1)$\&$(2,2) in warm molecular gas located in the surroundings of massive young stellar objects or, more generally, in massive star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The redshifted 21 cm signal from the cosmic dawn and Epoch of Reionization (EoR) encodes important information about both astrophysical processes and primordial physics, such as inflation. In this work, we use morphological statistics to explore the sensitivity of the 21 cm signal to inflationary features and EoR dynamics simultaneously. Focusing on primordial features from particle production during inflation we generate semi-numerical simulations of the 21 cm signal across redshifts 5 < z < 35, incorporating these features. Using Minkowski Functionals (MFs), we analyze the morphology of 21 cm fields: density, neutral hydrogen fraction, spin temperature, and brightness temperature. We demonstrate that MFs are highly sensitive to both the amplitude and scale of primordial features, capturing rich morphological information. In particular, we show that MFs can robustly identify inflationary features and distinguish them from the standard model. We further explore various EoR scenarios, and demonstrate that combining MFs across redshifts can disentangle the signatures of primordial features from EoR effects. This approach opens new avenues for probing inflation with upcoming 21 cm surveys.
#### A complete survey of filaments in Cygnus X

 - **Abstract**
 Filamentary structures are widely observed in molecular clouds, yet most filament observations are biased toward case studies and small samples; a uniform census within a single giant molecular cloud is still missing. We do a complete census of filaments in Cygnus X and quantify their links to dense cores, the magnetic field (B field), and HII regions. Using the updated getsf algorithm on the Cygnus X column-density map, we extracted 2633 filaments and 6551 cores. We built CMFs for cores on and off filaments, compared filament orientations with the Planck B field, measured radial column-density profiles near HII-region boundaries, and computed distances between young stellar objects and filament spines. Filaments have a typical width of 0.5 pc in Cygnus X at a resolution of 0.12 pc and host > 93% of high-mass cores (>= 20 Msun). The on-filament CMF shows a high-mass (> 10 Msun) slope of -2.30, while the off-filament CMF is steeper (-2.83). The onCMF peak mass is well below the Bonnor-Ebert mass, whereas the outCMF peak is comparable to it. At 5' resolution, filaments are mostly perpendicular to the B field except at the lowest column densities; the transition occurs near Av = 10 mag. Prominent filaments and high-mass cores preferred to be located around HII-region boundaries or at intersections of multiple HII regions; filament profiles are steeper on the side facing the HII region. Massive-core formation depends strongly on filaments, which may provide reservoirs that feed cores via accretion. The B field likely regulates filament formation, consistent with the type-O mode (converging flows along an oblique MHD shock) and an HII-driven bubble-filament paradigm for Cygnus X.
#### Low-frequency-selected Fast Radio Burst Host Galaxy Candidates

 - **Abstract**
 We present a pilot study on the host galaxy environments of CHIME/FRBs by cross-matching baseband-localised events with the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Data Release 2 (LoTSS DR2) at 144 MHz. Unlike traditional methods reliant on optical imaging, our radio-based selection allows for the identification of dust-obscured or optically faint star-forming galaxies. Of the 140 CHIME FRBs considered, 33 lie within the LoTSS DR2 footprint, and 16 show potential radio counterparts. Through multi-wavelength analysis, spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, and redshift constraints from the Macquart relation, we identify two secure and one tentative host candidates, all consistent with active star formation. However, their H$\alpha$-derived star formation rates appear underestimated, likely due to significant dust attenuation, as suggested by infrared colours and compact optical morphologies. Our results highlight the value of low-frequency radio data in complementing optical host searches and demonstrate the feasibility of host identification even in the absence of optical confirmation. With forthcoming data from LoTSS DR3 and the full CHIME/FRB baseband release, this method offers a promising path toward statistically robust studies of FRB host galaxies and their environments.
#### Beyond solar metallicity: How enhanced solid content in disks re-shape low-mass planet torques

 - **Abstract**
 The migration of low-mass planets is tightly controlled by the torques exerted by both gas and solids in their natal disks. While canonical models assume a solar solid-to-gas mass ratio (epsilon=0.01) and neglect the back-reaction of solid component of the disk, recent work suggests that enhanced metallicity can radically alter these torques. We quantify how elevated metallicities (epsilon=0.03 and epsilon=0.1) modify the gas and solid torques, test widely used linear scaling prescriptions, and identify the regimes where solid back-reaction becomes decisive. We performed global, 2D hydrodynamic simulations that treat solid material as a pressureless fluid fully coupled to the gas through drag and include the reciprocal back-reaction force. The planet was maintained on a fixed circular orbit, thus we computed static torques. The Stokes number was varied from 0.01 to 10, three surface-density slopes (p=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5) and three accretion efficiencies (eta=0, 10, and 100%) were explored. Torques, obtained by rescaling canonical epsilon=0.01 results, were compared with direct simulations. Solid torques scale linearly with epsilon, but gas torques deviate by 50-100% and can even reverse sign for St<=1 in epsilon=0.1 disks. These are due to strong, feedback-driven, asymmetric gas perturbations in the co-orbital region, amplified by rapid planetary accretion. Solid back-reaction in high-metallicity environments can dominate the migration torque budget of low-mass planets. Simple metallicity rescalings are therefore unreliable for St<=2, implying that precise migration tracks - particularly in metal-rich disks -- require simulations that fully couple solid and gas dynamics. These results highlight metallicity as a key parameter in shaping the early orbital architecture of planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a Monte Carlo study of energy extraction from rotating (Kerr) black holes via the Penrose process using rocket propulsion. Through over 250,000 trajectory simulations, we establish sharp constraints on when Penrose extraction with escape to infinity succeeds. The mechanism requires that exhaust ejected inside the ergosphere carries negative Killing energy, which is kinematically accessible only via ultra-relativistic ejection deep within the ergosphere. We find that successful extraction with escape is statistically rare ($\sim$1% in broad parameter scans) and is governed by strict thresholds: it requires high black hole spin (empirically $a/M \gtrsim 0.89$) and ultra-relativistic exhaust velocity (onset at $v_e \approx 0.91c$). When conditions are highly tuned to a specific "sweet spot," success rates can reach 88.5%, representing a narrow extraction window rather than generic behavior. Furthermore, single-impulse thrust at periapsis achieves significantly higher cumulative efficiency ($\eta_{\rm cum} \approx 19\%$) compared to continuous thrust ($\sim$2--4%) due to path-averaging penalties. These constraints quantify the extreme fine-tuning required for material-based Penrose extraction, consistent with the astrophysical dominance of electromagnetic mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 While $\Lambda$CDM provides a good fit to cosmological data, it fails to address many of the outstanding questions in contemporary cosmology. Chief among these are the Hubble tension and the apparent dynamical nature of dark energy as inferred from the recent DESI DR2 analysis. In this work, we analyze a field-theoretic description of cosmology where both dark energy and dark matter are interacting spin zero fields. We give a thorough study of a wide range of the interaction strength and demonstrate the effect on the dark energy equation of state and the Hubble tension. Using the recent cosmological data, we extract constraints on cosmological parameters including the free parameters of the model.
#### Exploring the effects of diffuse ionised gas in two local analogues of high-redshift star-forming galaxies

 Aims. We investigate the impact of diffuse ionised gas (DIG) on the determination of emission line ratios and gas-phase metallicities in two local analogues of high-redshift star-forming galaxies: UM 462 and IIZw 40. Understanding how DIG affects these quantities is essential for interpreting unresolved observations of distant galaxies, where integrated spectra are often used to trace their chemical evolution. Methods. Using archival Very Large Telescope, Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) data, we spatially resolved the warm ionised medium of both galaxies. We derived oxygen abundances through the direct method and several HII-based strong-line calibrators, and we used the H$\alpha$ surface brightness ($\Sigma$(H$\alpha$)) to distinguish regions dominated by HII or DIG emission. Results. Oxygen abundances derived from the N2 and O3N2 indices show an inverse correlation with $\Sigma$(H$\alpha$), ionisation parameter, and EW(H$\alpha$), with DIG-dominated regions exhibiting higher 12+log(O/H) than the galaxy mean by $\sim$0.2 dex in UM 462 and $\sim$0.1 dex in IIZw 40. The metallicity differences between HII-dominated and DIG-dominated $\Sigma$(H$\alpha$) bins reach $\sim$0.4 dex and $\sim$0.3 dex in UM 462 and IIZw 40, respectively. The observed trends with $\Sigma$(H$\alpha$), metallicity, EW(H$\alpha$), and ionisation parameter indicate smoothly varying ionisation conditions rather than true abundance variations. These effects reflect different ionisation sources and levels, and can produce spurious metallicity gradients in galaxies with extended DIG structures, potentially mimicking signatures of metal-poor gas infall. In our sample, DIG ionisation is most likely dominated by photon leakage from H II regions, with additional contributions from feedback-driven shocks.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent simulations have identified long-lived ``prompt cusps'' -- compact remnants of early density peaks with inner profiles $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$. They can survive hierarchical assembly and potentially enhance signals of dark matter annihilation. In this work, we incorporate prompt cusps into the semi-analytic substructure framework \textsc{SASHIMI}, enabling a fully hierarchical, environment-dependent calculation of the annihilation luminosity that consistently tracks subhalos, sub-subhalos, and tidal stripping. We assign prompt cusps to first-generation microhalos and propagate their survival through the merger history, including an explicit treatment of cusps associated with stripped substructure. We find that the substructure hierarchy converges rapidly once a few levels are included, and that prompt cusps can raise the total annihilation boost of Milky-Way--size hosts at $z=0$ to $B\sim O(10)$ for fiducial cusp-occupation assumptions, compared to a subhalo-only baseline of $B_{\rm sh}\sim\mathrm{few}$. Across a wide range of host masses and redshifts, prompt cusps increase the normalization of $B(M_{\rm host},z)$ while largely preserving its mass and redshift trends. Compared to universal-average, peak-based estimates, our fiducial boosts are lower by about an order of magnitude, primarily reflecting a correspondingly smaller inferred cusp abundance in host halos, highlighting the importance of unifying peak-based cusp formation with merger-tree evolution and environmental dependence.
