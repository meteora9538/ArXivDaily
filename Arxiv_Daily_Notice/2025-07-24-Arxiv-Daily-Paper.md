 - **Abstract**
 Tracking the cold molecular gas contents of galaxies is critical to understand the interplay between star formation and galaxy growth across cosmic time. Observations of the long-wavelength dust continuum, a proxy for the cold gas, are widely used in the high-redshift community because of their ease and efficiency. These measurements rely on the assumption of a molecular gas-to-dust mass ratio, typically taken to be GDR ~ 100 in massive, metal-rich systems. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the 870um dust continuum in a sample of five massive quiescent galaxies at z ~ 1 with existing detections of CO(2-1). We find surprisingly weak dust emission, falling a factor of >~0.4-0.8 dex below the typical correlation between CO and continuum luminosity. We interpret this dust deficiency as evidence for unusually high GDR in these galaxies, which we calculate to range from 300 to at least 1200. Our results and other observations from the literature are generally compatible with predictions from the SIMBA cosmological simulation that dust is preferentially destroyed in quiescent galaxies. Ultimately, we conclude that the dust continuum is a highly unreliable tracer of the molecular gas in high-redshift quiescent galaxies. As a consequence we may know much less about the cold gas contents of this population than previously thought.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Based on Local Universe observations, quiescent galaxies (QGs) host lower to no HI compared to star-forming galaxies (SFGs), but no constraints have been derived so far at higher redshift (z>0.1). Understanding whether QGs can retain significant HI reservoirs at higher z is crucial to refine quenching and gas accretion models and to constrain overall star formation efficiency at different epochs. Aims. We aim to probe HI in candidate QGs at intermediate redshifts (z=0.36) and to understand whether there exists a class of QGs retaining consistent HI reservoirs and which parameters (dust content, stellar mass, Dn4000, morphology, environment) effectively capture HI-rich QGs. Methods. We perform 21-cm spectral line stacking on MIGHTEE-HI data at z=0.36, targeting two different samples of QGs, defined by means of a color-selection criterion and a spectroscopic criterion based on Dn4000, respectively. We also perform stacking on subsamples of the spectroscopically-selected quiescent sample to investigate the correlation between the HI content and other galaxy properties. Results. We find that QGs with an IR counterpart (i.e., dusty galaxies) are found to host a substantial HI content, on average just 40% lower than SFGs. In contrast, color-selected QGs still hold HI, but lower than SFGs by a factor 3. Among dusty objects, we find morphology to have a mild impact on the atomic gas content, with spirals hosting approximately 15-30% more HI than spheroids. Environmental effects are also present, with low-density regions hosting galaxies that are HI-richer than in high-density ones, by approximately 30% for spirals and 60% for spheroids. We suggest that, in general, HI content is driven by several factors, including quenching mechanisms and ISM enrichment processes. Also, quiescent galaxies - and especially dusty systems - seem to yield HI more consistently than in the Local Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Advancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of early massive galaxies and black holes requires detailed studies of dense structures in the high-redshift Universe. In this work, we present high-angular resolution ($\simeq0.3''$) ALMA observations targeting the CO(4--3) line and the underlying 3-mm dust continuum toward the Cosmic Web node MQN01, a region identified through deep multiwavelength surveys as one of the densest concentrations of galaxies and AGN at cosmic noon. At the center of this structure, we identify a massive, rotationally supported disk galaxy located approximately at $\sim10\,{\rm kpc}$ projected-distance and $\sim-300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ from a hyperluminous quasar at $z=3.2510$. By accurately modeling the cold gas kinematics, we determine a galaxy dynamical mass of $2.5\times10^{11}\,{M_{\odot}}$ within the inner $\simeq 4\,{\rm kpc}$, and a high degree of rotational support of $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma \approx 11$. This makes it the first quasar companion galaxy confirmed as a massive, dynamically cold rotating disk at such an early cosmic epoch. Despite the small projected separation from the quasar host, we find no clear evidence of strong tidal interactions affecting the galaxy disk. This might suggest that the quasar is a satellite galaxy in the early stages of a merger. Furthermore, our spectroscopic analysis reveals a broad, blueshifted component in the CO(4--3) line profile of the quasar host, which may trace a powerful molecular outflow or kinematic disturbances induced by its interaction with the massive companion galaxy. Our findings show that rotationally supported cold disks are able to survive even in high-density environments of the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring properties of young stellar objects (YSOs) is necessary for probing the pre-main-sequence evolution of stars. As YSOs exhibit complex geometry, measurement generally entails comparing observed radiation to template populations of radiative-transfer model YSO spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Due to uncertainty on the precise mechanics of star formation, the properties inferred for YSOs using these models often depend strongly on the assumed accretion history. We develop a framework for predicting observable properties of YSOs that is agnostic to the underlying accretion history, enabling comparison between theories. This framework links a set of radiative-transfer SEDs with protostellar evolutionary tracks to create models of evolving YSOs. Unlike previous works, we directly relate evolution models to observables through theoretical physical parameters rather than through intermediate, observationally derived analogues. We make flux predictions for YSOs corresponding to stars with birth masses from 0.2 to 50 $M_\odot$ during their accretion phase following isothermal-sphere, turbulent-core, and competitive accretion histories, showing that these histories may be observationally distinguished by examining the 100-$\mu$m and 3-mm fluxes of a YSO. We discuss the impact of dust models and parameter ranges on the output of radiative transfer simulations through a comparison to another SED model grid. We quantify the degree of confusion between YSO Stages and Classes across a wide range of physical scenarios; for each, we calculate confusion matrices that enable inference of the number of objects of a given Stage from an observed population. Finally, we critically examine the physical significance of various literature Stage and Class definitions.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of the magnetism, winds and rotation of low-mass stars are all linked. One of the most common ways to probe the magnetic properties of low-mass stars is with the Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) technique. The magnetic properties of partially convective stars has been relatively well explored with the ZDI technique, but the same is not true of fully convective stars. In this work, we analyse a sample of stars that have been mapped with ZDI. Notably, this sample contains a number of slowly rotating fully convective M dwarfs whose magnetic fields were recently reconstructed with ZDI. We find that the dipolar, quadrupolar and octupolar field strengths of the slowly rotating fully convective stars do not follow the same Rossby number scaling in the unsaturated regime as partially convective stars. Based on these field strengths, we demonstrate that previous estimates of spin-down torques for slowly rotating fully convective stars could have been underestimated by an order of magnitude or more. Additionally, we also find that fully convective and partially convective stars fall into distinct sequences when comparing their poloidal and toroidal magnetic energies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first robust helium (He) abundance measurements in star-forming galaxies at redshifts $1.6\lesssim z\lesssim 3.3$ using deep, moderate-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the AURORA survey. We establish a High$-z$ HeI Sample consisting of 20 galaxies with multiple high-S/N ($>5\sigma$) HeI emission-line detections, including the critical near-infrared $\lambda$10833 line. This is the first study at high redshift leveraging $\lambda$10833 to break degeneracies between temperature, electron density, optical depth, and He$^+$/H$^+$, enabling reliable He abundance determinations in the early universe. We use a custom MCMC framework incorporating direct-method electron temperature priors, extended optical depth ($\tau_{\lambda3890}$) model grids up to densities of $10^6$~cm$^{-3}$, and simultaneous fits of the physical conditions and HeI/HI line ratios to derive ionic He$^+$/H$^+$ abundances. Most of the AURORA galaxies follow the extrapolated $z\sim0$ He/H-O/H trend, indicating modest He enrichment by $z\sim2-3$. However, we identify a subpopulation of four galaxies that exhibit elevated He mass fractions ($\Delta Y>0.03$) without corresponding enhancements in N/O or $\alpha$-elements ($\sim20$% of the sample). This abundance pattern is inconsistent with enrichment from asymptotic giant branch stars, but favors early He enrichment from very massive stars (VMSs; $M\gtrsim100\ M_\odot$), which can eject He-rich, N-poor material via stellar winds and binary stripping in young stellar populations. We speculate that these elevated-He systems may represent an early phase of globular cluster (GC) formation where N enrichment is still lagging behind He production. This work demonstrates the power of JWST multi-line HeI spectroscopy for tracing early stellar feedback, enrichment pathways, and GC progenitor signatures in the high-z universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Many extreme velocity candidate stars have been found based on \textit{Gaia} astrometry, but need spectroscopic confirmation. We select late-type hypervelocity star (HVS) candidates from the \textit{Gaia} DR3 catalog with a $1\sigma$ lower limit of the tangential velocity of 800 km\,s$^{-1}$. J1903-0023, one of the brightest targets, stands out as high priority candidate for follow-up spectroscopy using the X-shooter instrument at ESO-VLT. We determine its atmospheric parameters and abundances utilizing synthetic spectral grids and a global $\chi^2-$minimization procedure, and its stellar parameters with the help of evolutionary tracks and the spectral energy distribution. The star shows variability in its light curve and follow-up spectroscopy confirms that the star is radial-velocity variable. The spectroscopic distance of J1903-0023 is lower than that based on the parallax, indicating that the star is not a hypervelocity binary star but bound to the Galaxy. The star turned out to be of spectral type F, very similar to the extreme-velocity star J0725-2351, which we analyse in the same way as the target. Apparently, both stars are very metal poor and old halo main-sequence (sdF) stars with masses slightly below the halo turn-off mass, and share the low metallicity ([Fe/H]=-2.3,-2.6) and strong alpha enhancement ([$\alpha$/Fe]$\sim0.44$). While J0725-2351 is non-rotating ($v\sin\,i<3$\,km\,s$^{-1}$), J1903-0023 is a fast rotator ($v\sin i=42.3\pm2.0$ km\,s$^{-1}$). The Gaia, and ZTF light curves show an eclipse at a 1.179 day period, similar to the rotation period of J1903-0023. We therefore conclude that J1903-0023 is a high-velocity tidally-synchronised binary most likely with a metal-poor M dwarf companion.
#### An extremely low mass ratio contact binary NW Aps with a potential compact companion star

 - **Abstract**
 The photometric solutions of NW Aps reveal that it is a low mass ratio ($q = 0.086$) contact binary system. Investigation of orbital period shows that its orbital period is increasing continuously at a rate of $dP/dt=+1.117(\pm0.005)\times{10^{-6}}day\cdot year^{-1}$, which may be caused by mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one at a rate of $\frac{dM_{2}}{dt}=-3.36(\pm0.02)\times{10^{-8}}M_\odot/year$. A cyclic variation of $P_3 = 22.9(\pm0.1)$ is also found in the O - C curve. There may be a potential compact object orbiting around NW Aps, with its minimum mass to be $M_3 = 0.436(\pm0.007)M_\odot$. However, the magnetic activity of the primary star may also account for the cyclic change. NW Aps is a stellar merger candidate with the longest orbital period among all stellar merge candidates with mass ratio $q < 0.1$. It is still in a stable state since the ratio of orbital angular momentum ($J_{orb}$) to spin angular momentum ($J_{spin}$) is $\frac{J_{orb}}{J_{spin}}$ = 3.257. Both of its primary and secondary star are oversized to main sequence stars, and the surface gravity of the primary and secondary stars are significant lower than main sequence stars. The P - log g relationship is fitted with parabola for low mass ratio contact binary systems. More targets laid in the gap are needed to confirm the P - log g relationship and reveal the final evolutionary state of low mass ratio contact binary system.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies evolve within a web-like cosmic structure, and their properties are strongly shaped by their surrounding environments. We apply a nonparametric Bayesian two-sample test based on Pólya tree priors to galaxy data from SDSS DR7 and DESI DR1 BGS to quantify the differences between galaxies in dense and sparse cosmic environments. Compared to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and parametric Bayesian test, our approach does not require strong assumptions about the underlying distributional form and provides a more sensitive and robust comparison of galaxy evolution across different environments. In particular, galaxies in VoidFinder voids tend to be fainter, less massive, and more star-forming compared to wall galaxies, while such contrasts are diminished under the V^2 REVOLVER pruning. These findings underscore the importance of both the statistical framework and the void classification algorithm in interpreting environmental effects on galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of cosmic rays increasingly point to the existence of nearby sources - so-called "local tevatrons", capable of accelerating particles to TeV energies. In this study, we examine the potential of a typical main-sequence star, represented by the Sun, to act as a source of TeV cosmic rays (CRs). We focus on identifying plausible mechanisms through which a quiescent star can accelerate charged particles to relativistic energies. We show that shock-drift acceleration processes operating within the chromospheres of the Sun and similar stars can accelerate particles to energies reaching the TeV scale. Additionally, we provide quantitative estimates of both the maximum achievable particle energies, spectral index of energy spectrum and the resulting cosmic-ray fluxes that such stellar environments could realistically produce. Our results indicate that ordinary stars could potentially contribute to the fine structure observed in the cosmic-ray spectrum at TeV energies and may help explain the local excess of TeV-scale electrons and positrons detected by H.E.S.S. and other observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123 is an exceptionally massive binary black hole (BBH) merger with unusually high component spins. Such extreme properties challenge conventional stellar evolution models predicting a black hole mass gap due to pair-instability supernovae. We analyze GW231123 using population-informed priors on BH mass and spin distributions to test possible formation scenarios: first-generation stellar collapse, hierarchical (multi-generation) mergers, and primordial origin. Our analysis strongly prefers scenarios where at least one component is a higher-generation BH. Both components are favored to have high spins, which rules out scenarios in which they are both first-generation (low spin) or primordial (nearly non-spin). We conclude that GW231123 is a hierarchical merger, with components plausibly originate from the successive mergers of $\sim 6$ and $\sim 4$ first-generation BHs, respectively. This suggests that repeated mergers can be frequent and even more massive intermediate-mass black holes may be produced. Thus mechanisms that can efficiently harden the BBHs' orbits are required, e.g., gas dynamical fraction in the disks of active galactic nucleus.
#### VERTICO IX: Signatures of environmental processing of the gas in Virgo cluster spiral galaxies through mapping of CO isotopologues

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we study CO isotopologue emission in the largest cluster galaxy sample to date: 48 VERTICO spiral galaxies in Virgo. We show for the first time in a significant sample that the physical conditions within the molecular gas appear to change as a galaxy's ISM is affected by environmental processes. 13CO is detected across the sample, both directly and via stacking, while C18O is detected in a smaller number of systems. We use these data to study trends with global and radial galaxy properties. We show that the CO/13CO line ratio changes systematically with a variety of galaxy properties, including mean gas surface density, HI-deficiency and galaxy morphology. 13CO/C18O line ratios vary significantly, both radially and between galaxies, suggesting real variations in abundances are present. Such abundance changes may be due to star formation history differences, or speculatively even stellar initial mass function variations. We present a model where the optical depth of the molecular gas appears to change as a galaxy's ISM is affected by environmental processes. The molecular gas appears to become more transparent as the molecular medium is stripped, and then more opaque as the tightly bound remnant gas settles deep in the galaxy core. This explains the variations we see, and also helps explain similar observations in cluster early-type galaxies. Next generation simulations and dedicated observations of additional isotopologues could thus provide a powerful tool to help us understand the impact of environment on the ISM, and thus the quenching of galaxies.
#### Fine-tuning the complex organic molecule formation: sulfur and CO ice as regulators of surface chemistry

 - **Abstract**
 Grain-surface chemistry plays a crucial role in the formation of molecules of astrobiological interest, including H$_{2}$S and complex organic molecules (COMs). They are commonly observed in the gas phase toward star-forming regions, but their detection in ices remains limited. Combining gas-phase observations with chemical modeling is therefore essential for advancing our understanding of their chemistry. In this paper we investigate the factors that promote or hinder molecular complexity combining gas-phase observations of CH$_{3}$OH, H$_{2}$S, OCS, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, and C$^{18}$O with chemical modeling in two dense cores: Barnard-1b and IC348. We observed millimeter emission lines of CH$_{3}$OH, H$_{2}$S, OCS, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, and C$^{18}$O along strips using the IRAM 30m and Yebes 40m telescopes. We used the gas-grain chemical model \texttt{Nautilus} to reproduce the observed abundance profiles adjusting parameters such as initial sulfur abundances and binding energies. H$_{2}$S, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ and C$^{18}$O gas-phase abundances vary up to one order of magnitude towards the extinction peak. CH$_{3}$OH abundance remains quite uniform. These abundances can only be reproduced assuming a decreasing sulfur budget, which lowers H$_{2}$S and enhances CH$_{3}$OH abundances. Decreasing binding energies, which are expected in CO-rich apolar ices, are also required. The sulfur depletion required by H$_2$S is generally higher than that required by CH$_3$OH, suggesting unknown sulfur sinks. These findings highlight the intricate relationship between sulfur chemistry and COM formation, driven by the competition between sulfur and CO for hydrogen atoms. Our study emphasizes that the growth of CO ice and the progressive sequestration of hydrogen atoms by sulfur are critical in determining whether chemical complexity can develop, providing key insights into the early stages of star and planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration transient events that are typically observed at radio wavelengths and cosmological distances but their origin remains unclear. Furthermore, most FRB origin models are related to the processes at stellar scales, involving neutron stars, blackholes, supernovae, etc. In this paper, our purpose is to determine whether multi-structural one-off FRBs and repeaters share similarities. To achieve this, we focus on analyzing the relationship between the FRB event rate and the star formation rate, complemented by statistical testing methods. Based on the CHIME/FRB Catalog 1, we calculate the energy functions for four subsamples, including apparent non-repeating FRBs (one-offs), repeaters, multi-structural one-offs, and the joint repeaters and multi-structural events, respectively. We then derive the FRB event rates at different redshifts for all four subsamples, all of which were found to share a similar cosmological evolution trend. However, we find that the multi-structural one-offs and repeaters are distinguishable from the KS and MWW tests.
#### Prediction of Apophis's deformation-driven rotational evolution during its closest encounter to the Earth in 2029

 - **Abstract**
 In 2029, the near-Earth asteroid (99942) Apophis approaches the Earth within six Earth radii. This opportunity is one of the rarest natural experiments that we can use to better characterize a small body through telescopic observations and space missions. Earlier geological investigations consistently suggested that major geological processes might not occur on Apophis during this closest encounter, including surface processing and interior deformation. However, minor resurfacing may occur, depending on local geological conditions. A critical finding is that the rotational evolution occurs due to the tidal effect from the Earth. The present study offers an additional perspective on the rotational evolution, which may vary due to variations in interior properties. Namely, possible deformation processes may change the spin state variation from the rigid body state, even if deformation is not measurable. The effort in this work is to explore this issue using a simplified model, motivated by earlier studies by Hirabayashi (2023) and Taylor et al. (2023). The results show that the deformation-driven spin state change may be possible, depending on Young's modulus. If this asteroid's Young's modulus is ~1 MPa or higher, the spin state only deviates a few degrees from the rigid body state over one year. However, if it is ~10 kPa or less, the spin state deviation may reach a few degrees, even a few days after the closest encounter. Both telescopic observations and space missions can provide strong insights into this phenomenon.
