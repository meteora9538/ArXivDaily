 - **Abstract**
 Determining molecular abundances in astrophysical environments is crucial for interpreting observational data and constraining physical conditions in these regions. Chemical modelling tools are essential for simulating the complex processes that govern molecular evolution. We present SIMBA, a new Python-based single-point astrochemical modelling package designed to solve chemical reaction networks across diverse astrophysical environments. The software follows standardised rate equation approaches to evolve molecular abundances under specified physical conditions, incorporating gas-phase chemistry, grain-surface processes, and photochemistry. While leveraging Python for accessibility, performance-critical routines utilise just-in-time compilation to achieve computational efficiency suitable for research applications. A key feature of SIMBA is its graphical interface, which enables rapid investigation of chemical evolution under varying physical conditions. This makes it particularly valuable for exploring parameter dependencies and complementing more computationally intensive multi-dimensional models. We demonstrate the package's capabilities by modelling chemical evolution in a photoevaporative flow driven by external FUV irradiation. Using simplified gas dynamics, we chain multiple SIMBA instances to create a dynamic 1D model where gas evolves both chemically and dynamically. Comparing this approach to typical static models - where chemistry in each grid cell evolves independently - reveals that molecular ices, especially those with relatively high binding energies like H2O, can survive much farther into the flow than static models predict. This example case highlights how SIMBA can be extended to higher dimensions for investigating complex chemical processes. The package is open-source and includes comprehensive documentation.

 - **Abstract**
 The role of interactions and mergers in the rapid quenching of massive galaxies in the early Universe remains uncertain, largely due to the difficulty of directly linking mergers to quenching. Collisional ring galaxies provide a unique opportunity, as their morphology allows precise dating of the interaction, which can then be compared to quenching timescales inferred from star formation histories. We study a gravitationally bound system at $z=1.61$ in the UDS field, composed of a Host galaxy ($M_\star = 10^{11.4} M_\odot$) with a collisional ring and an X-ray AGN, and the Bullet galaxy ($M_\star = 10^{11.2} M_\odot$), located at a projected distance of $\sim 8$ kpc. Combining JWST and HST imaging with Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy, we find compelling evidence for an ongoing starburst in the Host concurrent with rapid quenching in the Bullet. The ring, $\sim 20$ kpc in diameter, is expanding at $127^{+72}_{-29}$ km s$^{-1}$, implying the galaxies first collided 47--96 Myr ago. This timeline is consistent with the Host's current starburst and the Bullet's sudden quenching, strongly suggesting both phenomena were triggered by the interaction. Crucially, the Bullet shows no evidence of a preceding starburst, ruling out rapid gas consumption as the primary quenching channel. Instead, we suggest that merger-driven processes -- such as enhanced turbulence and disk instabilities -- may have suppressed star formation. An additional possibility, which we term the ``Dragon Effect,'' is that AGN-driven outflows from the Host disrupted the Bullet's low-density molecular gas, thereby preventing efficient star formation and accelerating quenching.

 - **Abstract**
 For nearly a decade, observations have shown that many older Sun-like stars spin faster than predicted, a phenomenon known as weakened magnetic braking (WMB). The leading hypothesis for WMB is a weakening of the large-scale dipole field, which leads to a less efficient angular momentum loss. To test this hypothesis on a star known to be in the WMB regime, we present the first Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) map of the Sun-like star $\tau$Ceti, reconstructed using spectropolarimetric data from the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope (CFHT). Our ZDI analysis reveals a remarkably simple, stable and weak ($\langle B\rangle =0.17 \mathrm{G}$) magnetic field, characterized by a predominantly dipolar ($\sim92\%$ magnetic energy contained in $l=1$ modes), and highly axisymmetric ($\sim88\%$ magnetic energy contained in $m<l/2$ modes) morphology. We infer a dipole field strength of $B_{\mathrm{dip}}=0.31 \mathrm{G}$, nearly an order of magnitude weaker than standard braking model predictions, providing direct confirmation of the weakened large-scale dipole predicted by the WMB hypothesis. This work establishes a new benchmark for ZDI, demonstrating that even extremely quiet stars in the WMB regime are accessible to this technique.

 - **Abstract**
 Given the vast number of stars that exist within binary systems, it remains important to explore the effect of binary star environments on the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems. Nearby binaries provide opportunities to characterize their properties and orbits through a combination of radial velocities, astrometry, and direct imaging. Eta Cassiopeiae is a bright, well-known binary system for which recent observations have provided greatly improved stellar masses and orbital parameters. We present additional radial velocity data that are used to perform an injection-recovery analysis for potential planetary signatures. We further provide a detailed dynamical study that explores the viability of planetary orbits throughout the system. Our combined analysis shows that giant planets are significantly ruled out for the system, and indeed no planetary orbits are viable beyond $\sim$8 AU of the primary star. However, terrestrial planets may yet exist within the Habitable Zone where orbits can remain long-term stable. We discuss the implications of these results, highlighting the effect of wide binary companions on giant planet formation, and the consequences for occurrence rates and planetary habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 SN 2024aecx is a nearby ($\sim$11 Mpc) Type IIb SN discovered within $\sim$1 d after explosion. In this paper we report high-cadence photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations, conducted from as early as 0.27 d post discovery out to the nebular phase at 158.4 d. We analyze the environment of SN 2024aecx and derive a new distance, metallicity and host extinction. The light curve exhibits a hot and luminous shock-cooling peak at the first few days, followed by a main peak with very rapid post-maximum decline. The earliest spectra are blue and featureless, while from 2.3 d after discovery prominent P-Cygni profiles emerge. At nebular phase, the emission lines exhibit asymmetric and double-peaked profiles, indicating asphericity and/or early dust formation in the ejecta. We simulated the progenitor and explosion using a two-component model of shock cooling and radioactive $^{56}$Ni heating; our model favors an extended, low-mass H-rich envelope with$ M_{\mathrm{e}} = 0.08^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\, M_{\odot} $ and a low ejecta mass of $ M_{\mathrm{ej}} = 2.65^{+1.21}_{-0.73} \, M_{\odot}. $The comprehensive monitoring of SN 2024aecx, coupled with the detailed characterization of its local environment, establishes it as a benchmark event for probing the progenitors and explosion mechanisms of Type IIb SNe.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar collisions in dense galactic nuclei might play an important role in fueling supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and shaping their environments. The gas released during these collisions can contribute to SMBH accretion, influencing phenomena such as active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events of the remnants. We address the challenge of rapidly and accurately predicting the outcomes of stellar collisionsincluding remnant masses and unbound gasacross a broad parameter space of initial conditions. Existing smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic (SPH) simulation techniques, while detailed, are too resource-intensive for exploratory studies or real-time applications. We develop a machine learning framework trained on a dataset of $\sim 16,000$ SPH simulations of main-sequence star collisions. By extracting physically meaningful parameters (e.g., masses, radii, impact parameters, and virial ratios) and employing gradient-boosted regression trees with Huber loss, we create a model that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. The method includes logarithmic transforms to handle dynamic ranges and regularization to ensure physical plausibility. The model achieves predictions of collision outcomes (remnant masses, and unbound mass) with very low mean absolute errors respect to the typical mass scale. It operates in fractions of a second, enabling large-scale parameter studies and real-time applications. Parameter importance analysis reveals that the impact parameter and the relative velocity dominate outcomes, aligning with theoretical expectations. Our approach provides a scalable tool for studying stellar collisions in galactic nuclei. The rapid predictions facilitate investigations into gas supply for SMBH accretion and the cumulative effects of collisions over cosmic time, particularly relevant to address the growth of SMBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 At high metallicity, a majority of massive stars have at least one close stellar companion. The evolution of such binaries is subject to strong interaction processes, heavily impacting the characteristics of their life-ending supernova and compact remnants. For the low-metallicity environments of high-redshift galaxies constraints on the multiplicity properties of massive stars over the separation range leading to binary interaction are crucially missing. Here we show that the presence of massive stars in close binaries is ubiquitous, even at low metallicity. Using the Very Large Telescope, we obtained multi-epoch radial velocity measurements of a representative sample of 139 massive O-type stars across the Small Magellanic Cloud, which has a metal content of about one fifth of the solar value. We find that 45% of them show radial velocity variations which demonstrate that they are members of close binary systems, and predominantly have orbital periods shorter than one year. Correcting for observational biases indicates that at least 70[+11:-6]% of the O stars in our sample are in close binaries, and that at least 68[+7:-8]% of all O stars interact with a companion star during their lifetime. We found no evidence supporting a statistically significant trend of the multiplicity properties with metallicity. Our results indicate that multiplicity and binary interactions govern the evolution of massive stars and determine their cosmic feedback and explosive fates.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the PMO 13.7m telescope, we present large-field and high-sensitivity CO(1-0) line observations toward the Crab Nebula, in order to better understand the interstellar gas environment of this well-known historical supernova remnant. The CO observations show molecular clouds toward the Crab Nebula at a velocity range from about 0 to 16 km/s. After checking the CO spectra, we find shocked signatures in the clouds extending at a velocity of roughly [5, 11] km/s. These shocked molecular clouds, with an angular distance of about 0.4-0.5 degree toward the Crab Nebula, are located at the shell of a bubble discovered in the GALFA-HI (and HI4PI) images at the same velocity range. The dimension of the bubble is roughly 2.3$\times$2.6 degree and the expansion velocity is about 5 km/s. The kinetic energy referred from the shocked molecular clouds (roughly 3.5$\times$10$^{51}$ erg), together with the HI bubble, support the picture that the Crab Nebula belongs to a typical core-collapse supernova remnant. Nevertheless, due to the large uncertainty in the distance measurement, further observations are needed to verify the physical association between the shocked molecular clouds and the Crab Nebula.

 - **Abstract**
 During the formation of rocky planets, the surface environments of growing protoplanets were dramatically different from those of present-day planets. The release of gravitational energy during accretion would have maintained a molten surface layer, forming a magma ocean. Simultaneously, sufficiently massive protoplanets could acquire hydrogen-rich proto-atmospheres by capturing gas from the protoplanetary disk. Chemical equilibration among the atmosphere, magma ocean, and iron core plays a key role in determining the planet's interior composition. In this study, we investigate terrestrial planet formation under such primitive surface conditions. We conduct N-body simulations to model the collisional growth from protoplanets to planets, coupled with chemical equilibrium calculations at each giant impact event, where surface melting occurs. Our results show that planetary growth proceeds through a series of giant impacts, and the timing of these impacts relative to the dissipation of disk gas significantly influences the volatile budget. In particular, initial impacts, occurring while nebular gas is still present, can lead to excess hydrogen incorporation into the protoplanet's core. Subsequent impacts with hydrogen-poor bodies, after gas dispersal, can dilute this hydrogen content. This process allows for the formation of a planet with a hydrogen inventory consistent with Earth's current core. Our findings suggest that late giant impacts, occurring after the depletion of nebular gas, provide a viable mechanism for producing Earth-like interior compositions near 1 AU.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during its 2021/22 apparition, aiming to investigate its dust and gas environment and compare the results with those obtained in 2015/16 using the same telescope. Quasi-simultaneous photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric observations were carried out at the 6-m BTA SAO telescope. The comet was observed on 6 October 2021, 31 days before perihelion, with \textit{g}-SDSS and \textit{r}-SDSS filters, and on 6 February 2022, 96 days after perihelion, using narrowband cometary filters: BC ($\lambda4450/62$~Å), RC ($\lambda6839/96$~Å), and CN ($\lambda3870/58$~Å). These were complemented by images from the 2-m Liverpool Telescope (La Palma). On 6 October 2021, a sunward jet and long dust tail were detected. By 6 February 2022, the dust coma morphology had changed noticeably, revealing a bright sunward neckline structure superimposed on the projected dust tail, along with two jets at position angles of 133$^{\circ}$ and 193$^{\circ}$. Spectra showed strong CN emission, with relatively weak C$_2$, C$_3$ and NH$_2$ emissions. The dust production rate $Af\rho$ did not exceed 200~cm (uncorrected for phase angle) in both epochs. An unusual CN coma morphology was observed, with evidence of an additional CN source associated with dust jets. Geometric modeling of the jets' dynamics indicated an active area at latitude $-70^{\circ} \pm 4^{\circ}$ with a jet opening angle of $20^{\circ} \pm 6^{\circ}$ on 6 October 2021, and two active areas at latitudes $-58^{\circ} \pm 5^{\circ}$ and $-53^{\circ} \pm 10^{\circ}$, separated by longitude $150^{\circ} \pm 20^{\circ}$, producing the observed jets on 6 February 2022. The average particle velocity in the jets was about $0.32 \pm 0.04$~km~s$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We determined HI parameters for eleven nearby late-type dwarf galaxies using FASHI data cubes, despite the fact that the first version of the FASHI catalog does not list any radio sources that could correspond to these galaxies. Four of them are probable peripheral satellites of the bright spiral galaxies: NGC 3556, NGC 4258, NGC 4274, NGC 4490, while others are isolated objects. The considered sample has the following median parameters: a heliocentric velocity of $V_\mathrm{h} = 542 \ km/s$, an HI-line width of $W_\mathrm{50} = 28 \ km/s$, an hydrogen mass of $\log (M_{HI} / M_\odot) = 6.83$, a stellar mass of $\log (M_\star / M_\odot) = 7.19$, and a specific star formation rate of $\mathrm{sSFR} = -10.17 \ yr^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Current models of binary systems often depend on simplified approach of the radiation field, which are unlikely to accurately capture the complexities of asymmetric environments. We investigate the dynamical and chemical implications of a 3D asymmetric radiation field that accounts for the optical properties of sub-structures present in a protoplanetary disk, as well as the inclusion of a secondary radiation source in binary systems. We conducted a series of 3D-SPH hydrodynamical simulations using PHANTOM, coupled with the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code MCFOST, to compute disc temperatures on-the-fly. We explored different binary-disk orientations (0$^o$ and 30$^o$) for an eccentric binary, along with a constant dust-to-gas ratio and dust as a mixture prescription. We also simulated an outburst event as an example of a drastic increase in luminosity. Heating from the secondary star inflates the outer disk, increasing the aspect ratio facing the companion by about 25% in inclined cases compared to 10% in coplanar ones. Dust settling in the mid-plane enhances extinction along the disk plane, making the coplanar case cooler than the inclined one on the side of the disk facing the companion. Besides, heating causes a shift in the snow line for species with freeze-out temperatures below 50 K, depending on the disk-binary inclination and binary phase. During outbursts, the aspect ratio doubles on the star-facing side and increases by 50% on the opposite side in inclined cases. The snow line shift would impact all the species considered in the outburst case. Disk heating in binaries depends on stellar properties, orbital phase, and disk local and global characteristics. This results in temperature asymmetries, especially during secondary star outbursts, leading to variations in aspect ratio and snow lines that can affect chemistry and planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The simultaneous observation of gamma rays and neutrinos from the same astrophysical source offers a unique opportunity to probe particle acceleration and interaction mechanisms in ultra-high-energy environments. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is a next-generation ground-based gamma-ray facility, sensitive to energies from 20~GeV to 300~TeV. In this work, we present for the first time a performance study of CTAO based on joint simulations of steady-state sources emitting both neutrinos and gamma rays, under the assumption that neutrino events are detected by the KM3NeT telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. To identify potentially observable sources, we apply a neutrino-based selection filter according to KM3NeT's discovery potential. We then simulate gamma-ray detectability with CTAO, taking into account visibility, sensitivity, and extragalactic background light absorption. The analysis is specifically focused on exploring the detectability of sources at low neutrino luminosities, limited to values below $10^{52}\,\mathrm{erg\,yr^{-1}}$, in order to assess the performance of CTAO and KM3NeT in identifying faint extragalactic emitters. Particular attention is given to the strategic role of KM3NeT's geographic location, which provides access to Southern-sky sources, and to the impact of the planned CTA+ upgrade, which will enhance CTAO-South with Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs). Our results highlight the importance of coordinated multi-messenger strategies between KM3NeT and CTAO to maximize the discovery potential of astrophysical neutrino sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new determination of the evolving far-infrared galaxy luminosity function (FIR LF) and the resulting inferred evolution of dust-obscured star-formation rate density (SFRD) out to redshift z~6. To establish the evolving co-moving number density of FIR-bright objects, we make use of the high-resolution ALMA follow-up study (AS2UDS), of the JCMT SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey (S2CLS) sub-mm imaging in the UKIDSS UDS survey field. In order to estimate the contributions of faint/low-mass sources we implement a method in which the faint-end of the IR LF is inferred by stacking (in stellar mass and redshift bins) the optical/near-infrared samples of star-forming galaxies into the appropriate FIR Herschel and sub-mm JCMT maps. Using this information we determine the faint-end slope of the FIR LF in two intermediate redshift bins (where it can be robustly established) and then adopt this result at all other redshifts. The evolution of the characteristic luminosity of the galaxy FIR LF, L*, is found to be increase monotonically with redshift, evolving as z^1.38+-0.07, while the characteristic number density is well fitted by double power-law function, constant at z<2.24 and declining as z^-4.95+-0.73 at higher redshifts. The evolution of the corresponding dust-obscured star-formation rate density was then calculated and is here compared with the results from a number of recent studies in the literature. Our analysis confirms that dust-obscured star-formation activity dominates SFRD at cosmic noon, but then becomes progressively less important with increasing redshift: while dusty star-forming galaxies are still found out to the highest redshifts explored here, UV-visible star formation dominates at z>4, and dust-obscured activity contributes <25% of SFRD by z~6.

 - **Abstract**
 In cold, dense astrophysical environments dust grains are mixed with molecular ices. Chemistry in those dust/ice mixtures is determined by diffusion and reaction of molecules and radicals. However, investigations of diffusion of astrophysically relevant radicals and molecules across the surface and through the pores of cosmic dust grains and of surface reactions consequent to such diffusion is largely uncharted territory. This paper presents results of a study of a solid-state reaction of two molecular species, CO2 and NH3, separated by a layer of porous silicate grain aggregates, analogues of cosmic dust. The experiments demonstrate that the presence of the dust layer was necessary for a pure thermal CO2 + 2NH3 reaction to proceed, leading to the formation of ammonium carbamate (NH4+NH2COO-), an ionic solid containing a complex organic moiety of prebiotic interest recently detected in a protoplanetary disk. This result speaks for: (i) efficient diffusion of molecules on/within cosmic dust, (ii) an underestimated role for surface catalysis in the astrochemistry of cosmic dust, and (iii) potentially efficient dust-promoted chemistry in warm cosmic environments, such as protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsars and their pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are unique laboratories for extreme astrophysical processes. This dissertation combines Fermi-LAT observations with a time-dependent leptonic PWN model (TIDE) to explore their gamma-ray emission. The model was validated on benchmark PWNe and applied to a systematic LAT search, leading to the discovery of new MeV-GeV candidates and the first population-level characterization. Several sources were modeled in detail, and predictions for potential TeV-emitting PWNe were tested against current and future observatories. Ultra-high-energy gamma-ray sources were also examined, revealing limits of standard leptonic scenarios. Beyond PWNe, stringent upper limits were obtained for the binary pulsar 1A 0535+262, and steady emission was detected from the globular cluster M5. Together, these results advance our understanding of pulsar environments and establish a framework for future multi-wavelength and next-generation gamma-ray studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Using NIRSpec on JWST, we studied a sample of 15 intermediate-mass (1.8-4.1 Msun) young stellar objects (YSOs) previously identified with MIRI photometry in the low-metallicity NGC 346 star-forming cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). All objects, observed in the 1.7-5.3 micron range, show strong hydrogen recombination lines in the Paschen, Brackett, Pfund, and Humphreys series, confirming their very young ages. The spectra of 11 YSOs show prominent absorption bands from the three most important ice species (H2O, CO2, CO), marking the first detection of these ices in intermediate-mass YSOs beyond our Galaxy. In three YSOs, water ice appears to be in crystalline form. In some objects, we also detect 13CO2 and OCS ices -- never before observed beyond the Milky Way (MW) -- and methanol ice in at least one star. We compared the column densities of H2O, CO2, and CO ices with those measured in more and less massive protostars in the MW and Large Magellanic Cloud, finding that in NGC 346 ice column densities reach values nearly an order of magnitude lower than in more massive objects (~1x10^{17} cm-2 for water and ~1x10^{16} cm-2 for CO2 and CO). However, the relative proportions of the ice species abundances do not differ from those in massive MW YSOs. This suggests that metallicity may not significantly affect ice chemistry in protoplanetary discs and that, shielded by the protostellar envelope or deep in the midplane, circumstellar material is likely impervious to the radiation environment.
