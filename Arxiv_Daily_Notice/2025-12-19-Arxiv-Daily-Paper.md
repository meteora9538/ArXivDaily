 - **Abstract**
 Very metal-poor massive stars in the Local Group are our best proxies for the Universe's first stars, making them essential for modeling reionization and early galactic chemical evolution. Studying such stars in our Local Universe is key to extrapolating our knowledge to more distant regions, where individual massive stars cannot be resolved but are dynamically and chemically shaping their environments. The MUSE integral field spectrograph has transformed massive star studies in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds, but resolving star-forming galaxies containing very metal-poor stars is at the limit of the current field of view and sensitivity. Therefore, only small dedicated efforts of selected regions are studied, providing us with snapshots of low-metallicity massive stars rather than a comprehensive picture. This scarcity is a major bottleneck for understanding and sufficiently modelling the evolution and feedback of massive stars across cosmic time. We therefore envision a new generation of panoramic integral-field spectrographs and high multiplex multi-object spectrographs mounted on dedicated large optical telescopes. Such facilities will not only allow to resolve very-metal-pool galaxies, but further enable the systematic exploration of the massive stellar content across the entire Local Group, thereby reaching a new era in massive star studies and understanding.

 - **Abstract**
 Each galaxy is observed only once along its life, making galaxy evolution fundamentally an inverse statistical problem: time-dependent physics must be inferred from ensembles of single-epoch snapshots. To move beyond descriptive scaling relations toward physical regulation mechanisms of star formation, quenching, chemical enrichment and black hole growth, galaxies must be treated as realizations of a stochastic process whose hyper-parameters (e.g., correlation timescales, burstiness, duty cycles) are inferred hierarchically. This demands both depth and scale: continuum S/N sufficient for absorption-line ages and chemistry, and samples far larger than those in SDSS, DESI, 4MOST or MOONS, which provide either depth or size but not both across $0<z<3$. Once the relevant axes of mass, redshift, environment, structure and evolutionary phase are populated, the requirement naturally rises from $10^7$ to $\sim10^8$ galaxies. This is the regime where stochastic hyper-parameters can be well constrained and where comparisons to simulations and cosmological forward models become limited by theory rather than observations. We outline the science enabled by such a programme and the corresponding requirements for a future ESO wide-field spectroscopic facility capable of delivering tens to hundreds of millions of rest-UV-optical spectra over $0\lesssim z\lesssim3$.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite numerous search campaigns based on a diverse set of observational techniques, exomoons - prospective satellites of extrasolar planets - remain an elusive and hard-to-pin-down class of objects. Yet, the case for intensifying this search is compelling: as in the Solar System, moons can act as proxies for studying planet formation and evolution, provide direct clues as to the migration history of the planetary hosts and, in favourable cases, offer potentially habitable environments. Here, we present an investigation into how the search for exomoons would benefit from a new interferometric facility operating in the optical wavelength domain and leveraging baselines substantially longer than the ones the VLTI is currently equipped with. We find that an interferometer providing an astrometric precision of 1$\,\mu$as would be able to robustly detect Earth-mass and sub-Earth-mass exomoons on dynamically stable orbits around Jupiter-like planets at distances between 50 and 200 pc.

 - **Abstract**
 The spin-orbit tilt angles $\theta_{1(2)}$ of merging stellar-mass black holes provide key insights into their astrophysical origin. The LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA Collaborations (2025a, arXiv:2508.18083) report that the spin-orbit tilt distribution of mergers in the latest Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0 exhibits a global peak at near-perpendicular directions $\cos\theta_{1(2)}\approx0$. Here, we recover this feature using hierarchical Bayesian inference with parametric models that are tailored to enhance the diagnostic power about astrophysical formation channels. We find that the spin distribution of the low-mass bulk of the binary black hole merger population $(m_1\lesssim 44.3^{+8.7}_{-4.6}\,\rm M_\odot)$ can be well-modelled by a dominant Gaussian component that peaks at $\cos\theta_{1(2)}\approx0$, possibly mixed with a subdominant isotropic component. Models that include a component with spins preferentially aligned with the orbit are disfavoured by current data (with Bayes factors $|\Delta\ln\mathcal{B}|\approx1$ to $3$) and constrain its contribution to be small ($\xi\sim\mathcal{O}(1)\,\%$). If these findings are reinforced by more detections, they would challenge any major contribution from the traditional isolated-binary formation scenario yielding closely aligned spins. Instead, the dominant component with near-perpendicular spins qualitatively matches expectations from the evolution of isolated massive stellar triples in the galactic field, where the Lidov-Kozai effect naturally produces a unique overabundance of mergers with $\cos\theta_{1(2)}\approx0$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) provides a key laboratory for exploring the diversity of star formation and interstellar chemistry under subsolar metallicity conditions. We present the results of a hot core survey toward 30 massive protostellar objects in the LMC using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 350 GHz. Continuum imaging reveals 36 compact sources in total, among which line analyses identify 9 hot cores and 1 hot-core candidate, including two newly identified sources. We detect CO, HCO+, H13CO+, HC15N, HC3N, SiO, SO, SO+, NS, SO2, 34SO2, 33SO2, CH3OH, 13CH3OH, HCOOH, HCOOCH3, CH3OCH3, C2H5OH, H2CCO (tentative), and hydrogen recombination lines from hot cores. CH3OCH3, a complex organic molecule larger than CH3OH, is detected for the first time in a hot core outside the LMC bar region. All hot cores show stronger emission in the high-excitation SO line compared to non-hot-core sources, suggesting that its strong detection will be useful for identifying hot-core candidates in the LMC. Chemical analysis reveals a spread of more than two orders of magnitude in CH3OH abundances, with some sources deficient in COMs. In contrast, SO2 is detected in all hot cores, and its abundance shows a good correlation with rotational temperature. The hot cores without CH3OH detections are all located outside the LMC bar region and are characterized by either high luminosity or active star formation in their surroundings. A combination of locally low metallicity, active star formation in the vicinity, and high protostellar luminosity may jointly trigger the COM-poor hot core chemistry observed in the LMC.
#### ASKAP discovery of a 30 kpc bipolar outflow from the edge-on disk of the nearby spiral galaxy ESO 130-G012

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a large-scale, limb-brightened outflow, extending at least 30 kpc above and below the star-forming disk of the edge-on galaxy ESO 130-G012 (D = 16.9 Mpc). Partially obscured by Galactic foreground stars and dust, this optically unremarkable, low-mass galaxy reveals one of the largest known hourglass-shaped outflows from the full extent of its bright stellar disk. The outflow was discovered in 944 MHz radio continuum images from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) obtained as part of the "Evolutionary Map of the Universe" (EMU) project. Its height is at least 3x that of the stellar disk diameter (~10 kpc), while its shape and size most resemble the large biconical, edge-brightened FUV and X-ray outflows in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 3079. The large-scale, hourglass-shaped outflow of ESO 130-G012 appears to be hollow and originates from the star-forming disk, expanding into the halo with speeds close to the escape velocity before likely returning to the disk. Given ESO 130-G012's modest star formation rate, the height of the outflow is surprising and unusual, likely made possible by the galaxy's relatively low gravitational potential. Follow-up observations are expected to detect hot gas inside the bipolar outflow cones and magnetic fields along the X-shaped outflow wings. Neutral gas may also be lifted above the inner disk by the outflow.

 - **Abstract**
 The earliest stages of star formation are highlighted by complex interactions between accretion, outflow, and radiative processes, which shape the chemical and physical environment of the emerging protostar. James Webb Space Telescope observations of the low-mass, low-luminosity Class 0 protostar IRAS 16253-2429 reveal a central compact source. This object exhibits a rich mid-infrared emission spectrum of OH pure rotational lines and $\rm CO_2$ ro-vibrational lines. Unusually for a young stellar object, it has no mid-infrared line emission from $\rm H_2O$ to match the other molecules. We demonstrate that the emitting OH molecules arise from UV photodissociation of $\rm H_2O$ in its second absorption band at $\lambda = 114-145$ nm, and that the OH emission is a fluorescent cascade starting with highest-excitation rotational states. This situation offers the opportunity of using the infrared OH spectrum to measure the UV flux from the central protostar. Thereby we determine the disk-star accretion rate to be $3 \times 10^{-10} \ M_\sun \ {\rm year^{-1}}$, and demonstrate that the system luminosity arises mostly from the protostar's photosphere rather than from accretion luminosity. The result is in accord with the measured outflow rate of IRAS 16253-2429 and lies within the outflow/accretion-flow rate trend often inferred for protostars; and with episodic accretion as the dominant mechanism by which this protostar has grown.

 - **Abstract**
 The known population of non-accreting neutron stars is ever growing and currently consists of more than 3500 sources. Pulsar surveys with the SKAO telescopes will greatly increase the known population, adding radio pulsars to every subgroup in the radio-loud neutron star family. These discoveries will not only add to the current understanding of neutron star physics by increasing the sample of sources that can be studied, but will undoubtedly also uncover previously unknown types of sources that will challenge our theories of a wide range of physical phenomena. A broad variety of scientific studies will be made possible by a significantly increased known population of neutron stars, unravelling questions such as: How do isolated pulsars evolve with time; What is the connection between magnetars, high B-field pulsars, and the newly discovered long-period pulsars; How is a pulsar's spin-down related to its radio emission; What is the nuclear equation of state? Increasing the known numbers of pulsars in binary or triple systems may enable both larger numbers and higher precision tests of gravitational theories and general relativity, as well as probing the neutron star mass distribution. The excellent sensitivity of the SKAO telescopes combined with the wide field of view, large numbers of simultaneous tied-array beams that will be searched in real time, wide range of observing frequencies, and the ability to form multiple sub-arrays will make the SKAO an excellent facility to undertake a wide range of neutron star research. In this paper, we give an overview of different types of neutron stars and discuss how the SKAO telescopes will aid in our understanding of the neutron star population.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the magnetic field environment around Mars and its response to upstream solar wind conditions provide key insights into the processes driving atmospheric ion escape. To date, global models of Martian induced magnetosphere have been exclusively physics-based, relying on computationally intensive simulations. For the first time, we develop a data-driven model of the Martian induced magnetospheric magnetic field using Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) combined with MAVEN observations and physical laws. Trained under varying solar wind conditions, including B_IMF, P_SW, and {\theta}_cone, the data-driven model accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional magnetic field configuration and its variability in response to upstream solar wind drivers. Based on the PINN results, we identify key dependencies of magnetic field configuration on solar wind parameters, including the hemispheric asymmetries of the draped field line strength in the Mars-Solar-Electric coordinates. These findings demonstrate the capability of PINNs to reconstruct complex magnetic field structures in the Martian induced magnetosphere, thereby offering a promising tool for advancing studies of solar wind-Mars interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has uncovered a substantial population of Massive ($M_{\star} \gtrsim 10^{10 }\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$), Quenched Galaxies (MQGs) in the early Universe ($z \gtrsim 2$), whose properties challenge current galaxy formation models. In this paper, we examine this population of MQGs within the new COLIBRE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We report number densities and stellar mass functions in broad agreement with the latest observations. The predicted quenching and formation timescales are qualitatively consistent with observational inferences. Leveraging the state-of-the-art physics in COLIBRE, the model predicts that MQGs have dust and $\rm H_{2}$ fractions more than $1$ dex lower than their massive star-forming counterparts; while their sizes and kinematics remain broadly similar. We further explore the processes driving galaxies to become massive and quenched in COLIBRE, identifying active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback as the primary quenching mechanism. Compared to star-forming galaxies of similar mass, MQGs host more massive black holes (BHs) and exhibit higher star formation efficiencies. These differences arise from their environments, particularly at local ($\rm 0.3\,cMpc$) to intermediate scales ($\rm 1.0\,cMpc$) before quenching, where overdense regions are associated with enhanced gas inflows, higher BH accretion and, hence, feedback power. We find that about $55\%$ of MQGs survive as the main progenitors of $z=0$ galaxies when they are selected at $z=3$, although up to $55\%$ experience rejuvenation episodes. Our results provide robust predictions for MQGs, show that tensions with observations are reduced when an effective observational uncertainty is forward-modelled, and clarify the mechanisms behind their origin.
#### ALMA and JWST Identification of Faint Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies up to z~8

 - **Abstract**
 We exploit a new sample of around 400 bright dusty galaxies from the ALMA CHAMPS Large Program, together with the rich JWST multi-band data products in the COSMOS field, to explore and validate new selection methods for identifying dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Here, we present an effective empirical selection criterion based on a newly defined parameter: I_star = log(M_star) x log(SFR). Incorporating the F277W-F444W color as a second parameter further improves the purity of the selection. We then apply this method to the COSMOS2025 catalog to search for fainter dusty galaxy candidates below the ALMA CHAMPS detection limit and, through a stacking technique, identify a population of high-redshift (z=6-8) DSFGs with an average flux density of$S_1.2mm = 0.15uJy and a space density of ~6E-6 Mpc^-3. This faint population seems to have been missed by most of the previous submillimeter/millimeter surveys, and ground- and space-based UV-to-NIR surveys. Finally, we discuss the possibility of an evolutionary connection between the z > 10 UV-bright galaxies recently discovered by JWST, the faint dusty z=6-8 galaxies identified here, and the population of z=3-5 massive quiescent galaxies, potentially linked as progenitor-descendant populations based on their abundance, redshifts, and stellar masses.
#### Astrophysical Implications of Eccentricity in Gravitational Waves from Neutron Star-Black Hole Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational-wave signal from the neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger GW200105 is consistent with this binary having significant orbital eccentricity close to merger. This raises the question of how an eccentric NSBH might form. Compact object binaries that form via isolated binary star evolution should radiate away any orbital eccentricity long before their gravitational-wave signal enters the sensitive frequency range of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network. Meanwhile, dynamical environments -- which can be conducive to mergers on eccentric orbits -- produce very few NSBHs. We estimate the minimum measurable eccentricity of NSBHs at 10 Hz orbit-averaged gravitational-wave frequency, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$, finding that for GW200105, GW200115, and GW230529-like systems, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$ is O(0.01). For a GW190814-like unequal-mass binary with significant higher-order mode content, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}=0.003$; this is an order of magnitude lower than when higher-order modes are not present. For dominant-mode signals from eccentric binaries with $m_2=1.5$ M$_\odot$ and a range of total masses from $3\,{\rm M_\odot} \leq M \leq50\,\rm M_\odot$, we find $0.008\leq e_{\mathrm{min},10}\leq0.022$. The relationship between $M$ and $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$ is linear when the binaries are non-spinning. When the binaries are maximally spin-precessing, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$ decreases as mass ratio becomes more unequal. We estimate the sensitivity of a quasi-circular templated search to a population of NSBHs from field triples, finding that we recover only 27% of our simulated population. Finally, we show that if ~1/3 of present NSBH detections are measurably eccentric, then all of them are consistent with an isolated field triple origin.
#### The dominant role of dark matter halo in quenching central galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the quenching of star formation in central galaxies remains a core challenge in galaxy evolution. Two decades ago, the concept of halo quenching was introduced as a dominant mechanism, positing that massive central galaxy quenching is governed by the thermodynamics of gas predominantly influenced by dark matter halos. However, a vastly increasing body of observational evidence consistently indicates that quenching correlates predominantly with central properties like velocity dispersion, bulge mass, and black hole mass. When these properties are controlled, halo mass appears to show weak influence, supporting AGN feedback as the primary mechanism. A recurring key issue, however, is that these studies rely on halo masses derived via abundance matching (AM). Direct observational measurements from weak lensing, satellite kinematics, and galactic dynamics reveal that AM systematically overestimates halo masses of star-forming centrals while underestimating those of passive ones. To accurately assess the true role of halo mass. we re-estimated halo masses for SDSS groups; the resulting halo mass function and stellar-to-halo mass relations (SHMRs) for both populations match theoretical predictions and weak lensing measurements. Using these improved masses, we find direct observational evidence that halo mass is the dominant factor in quenching central galaxies, with a clear threshold at $M_{h}\sim 10^{12.1}M_\odot; $. By applying a simple correction to AM data using weak lensing-derived SHMRs, we demonstrate that previous claims regarding the dominance of central properties stem primarily from systematic biases in AM halo masses. Our results suggest that the significance of AGN feedback is primarily manifested in halos above this mass threshold, in galaxies already primed for quenching. In other words, AGN feedback appears to become effective in halos above this mass threshold.

 - **Abstract**
 Thousands of X-ray sources have been detected in the Galactic center (GC), most believed to be cataclysmic variables (CVs). As a potential probe of the old stellar population, in particular CVs, the existence and detectability of novae in the GC remain elusive, due to the prohibitive extinction toward the GC and their relatively low occurrence rate. Nova remnants evolving in the characteristic hot ($T\sim{10^{6}~\rm K}$) and dense ($n_e\sim{10~\rm cm^{-3}}$) interstellar medium in the GC may shed light on recent novae and provide useful insight on the GC ecosystem. In this work, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of putative nova remnants in the GC environment and calculate their time-dependent multiwavelength emission to estimate the detectability. Among 79 models sampling the nova parameter space (primarily ejecta mass and velocity), 6, 44, and 51 modelled nova remnants are detectable at their X-ray, radio, and Paschen-$\alpha$ maximum, respectively, for existing {\it Chandra}, VLA, and HST observations of the GC. The predicted peak luminosities are $\sim10^{32}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, $\sim10^{31}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, and $\sim10^{36}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$ in these three bands and the detectable window ranges from weeks to notably hundred years. By specifying a CV population of the nuclear star cluster, we estimate the probability of detecting at least one remnant to be 20\%, 8\%, and 18\% in X-rays, radio, and Pa$\alpha$. The nova remnant would be best resolved in the X-ray band. Our study highlights the potential for detecting nova remnants through further observations, leveraging JWST and the potentially forthcoming AXIS and SKA.

 The semi-forbidden CIII] $\lambda\lambda$1907,1909 doublet is a key tracer of high-ionization emission in the early universe. We present a study of CIII] emission in galaxies at z=5-7, using publicly available JWST/NIRSpec prism data from programs including CEERS, JADES, RUBIES and CAPERS. We built a sample of 61 CIII]-emitting galaxies, and we classified them as star-forming or active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies using (1) rest-frame UV and optical emission-line diagnostic diagrams, and (2) the presence/absence of broad Balmer emission lines. The UV diagnostics are based on the combination of the rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of CIII] versus CIII]/HeII $\lambda$1640, and the EW of CIV versus CIV/HeII $\lambda$1640. For optical diagnostics, we employ the OHNO diagram, which combines [OIII] $\lambda$5007, H$\beta$, [NeIII] $\lambda$3869, and [OII] $\lambda\lambda$3727,3729- and we find it has a low efficiency on separating AGN from SFG. We find that half of the sources in our sample (29 out of 61 galaxies) exhibit at least one secure indication of AGN activity while 13 are potential AGNs based on the CIII] diagnostic. Physical properties, including stellar mass and star formation rate, are derived through spectral energy distribution modeling with Bagpipes. Our analysis reveals that JWST is uncovering a population of strong CIII] emitters at high redshift (5<z<7) with a median EW of 22.8 A. This EW is higher than that of a control sample of CIII] emitters at redshift 3<z<4 with a median EW of 4.7 A. We find that for the same range of Muv, the CIII] EW increases by $\sim$0.67 dex from 3<z<4 to 5<z<7, indicating strong redshift evolution in the line's strength. Finally, we identify five sources in our sample as Little Red Dots (LRDs); while four of these have already been identified as LRD in the literature, one is presented here for the first time.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing temperate exoplanet atmospheres remains challenging due to their small size and low temperatures. Recent JWST observations provide valuable data, but their interpretation has led to diverging conclusions. Complementary approaches combining laboratory experiments and photochemical modeling are essential for constraining atmospheric chemistry and interpreting observations. We aim to identify chemical pathways governing the formation and evolution of neutral species and to assess their sensitivity to key parameters such as C/O ratio and metallicity. Our approach combines experimental and numerical simulations on H2-rich gas mixtures representative of sub-Neptune atmospheres, spanning a wide range of CH4, CO, and CO2 mixing ratios. A cold plasma reactor simulates out-of-equilibrium upper-atmospheric chemistry. A 0D photochemical model reproduces reactor conditions, guiding interpretation of key pathways and abundance trends. We observe the formation of both reduced and oxidized organic compounds. In CH4-rich mixtures, hydrocarbons form efficiently through methane chemistry, correlating with CH4 concentration and agreeing with models. In more oxidizing environments, particularly CO2-rich mixtures, hydrocarbon formation is inhibited by complex reaction networks and oxidative losses. Oxygen incorporation enhances chemical diversity and promotes formation of oxidized organic compounds of prebiotic interest (H2CO, CH3OH, CH3CHO), especially in atmospheres containing both CH4 and CO2. Atmospheres containing CH4 and CO, which balance carbon and oxygen supply without excessive oxidative destruction, favor efficient production of hydrocarbons and oxidized compounds. Out-of-equilibrium chemistry plays a key role in the diversification and organic complexification of temperate exoplanet atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the effects of massive neutrinos on the cosmic web using the FLAMINGO simulations. We classify the cosmic web into voids, sheets, filaments, and clusters, and find that massive neutrinos affect the environment by decreasing the volume occupied by clusters and voids. We find that increasing the neutrino mass shifts the volume-weighted density distribution towards higher densities and leads to a more narrow density distribution, which we interpret as neutrinos delaying structure formation. We construct the minimum spanning tree (MST) graph from the subhaloes, adopting a number density chosen to match that expected for DESI-like observations. We show that most MST edges lie in filaments, approximately 70% throughout different simulations, which we link to its sensitivity to neutrino mass. We also link the MST's edge length signal at different scales to different cosmic web environments, with clusters dominating the signal at small scales, voids at longer scales, and filaments at intermediate scales. The strong correlation between MST edges and cosmic web environments reinforces the MST's potential to be used as a classifier for large-scale structure in galaxy surveys. We compare the effects of baryonic physics and massive neutrinos and find that each produces distinct signatures in MST edge lengths. This analysis is performed in 3D space, using the true positions of subhaloes and not accounting for redshift space distortions. Nevertheless, these results emphasise the MST's capability to go beyond two-point statistics, motivating future applications to real observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 Compact Groups (CGs) of galaxies are dense systems where projected separations are comparable to their optical diameters. A subset - non-isolated CGs - are embedded within major structures. Using multi-band S-PLUS data, we analyse galaxies in 122 non-isolated CGs within more massive systems such as larger groups and clusters. We compare them to galaxies in the host structures, hereafter surrounding group galaxies. Structural parameters were obtained with MorphoPLUS, a pipeline for multi-wavelength Sérsic profile fitting. Dividing galaxies into early (ETG), transition, or late types (LTG), we find: (1) Non-isolated CGs host higher quenched fractions and more ETGs, especially for stellar masses $\log(M/M_\odot) > 10.2$, than surrounding groups. (2) Sérsic indices increase with wavelength for all morphological types in both environments, whereas effective radii show a stronger morphology-dependent behaviour - ETGs become more compact towards redder bands, while LTGs exhibit flatter $Re(\lambda)$ trends. Environmental differences remain weak, with only a modest enhancement of the gradients for ETGs in non-isolated CGs. (3) Transition galaxies in CGs show a concentrated $R_e$-$n$ distribution and faint-end bimodality, consistent with ongoing morphological transformation absent in surrounding groups. (4) Phase-space analysis indicates that some CGs in clusters are projection artefacts, while others are genuine dense systems at various infall stages, from recent arrivals to ancient remnants. These results show that galaxies in non-isolated CGs follow distinct evolutionary paths compared to their surrounding groups galaxies, suggesting that the compact configuration plays a unique role beyond the influence of the larger-scale environment.
#### Probing thermal gradients of habitable-zone rocky planets using direct imaging as an anti-indicator of a global surface ocean

 - **Abstract**
 Future direct-imaging missions, such as the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE), aim to observe thermal emission from potentially habitable planets to characterize their surface environments and search for signs of life. Previous studies of directly imaged Earth-like planets have mainly examined the signatures of atmospheric composition, often using one-dimensional models, while the effect of horizontal temperature gradients has received limited attention. Because a pronounced horizontal temperature gradient may signal the absence of a global ocean, we investigate its detectability through thermal-emission direct imaging. Adopting Teegarden's Star b (zero-albedo equilibrium temperature $\sim 280$~K) as a benchmark, we compute three-dimensional atmospheric structures with and without a global ocean using the ROCKE-3D general circulation model and simulate geometry-dependent thermal emission spectra. We show that the temperature gradients that disfavor a global-ocean scenario manifest in both orbital phase variation and spectral shape of the snapshot spectra. The phase variation is more readily detectable: one-day integrations with LIFE at two orbital phases would reveal flux variations in no-ocean cases with 1-10~bar atmospheres, depending on background atmospheric composition. Shapshot spectra provide complementary diagnostics of global temperature contrast, the running brightness temperature of the continuum and detailed absorption band shapes, but require integration a few times longer. These three-dimensional effects, if neglected, can bias interpretations based on one-dimensional models. We also assess their detectability for other nearby exoplanets. Our results highlight the need to incorporate three-dimensional atmospheric structures when characterizing rocky exoplanets, both to constrain surface conditions and to avoid misinterpretation of spectral data.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the James Webb Space Telescope photometric color classification of mid-infrared (MIR) selected galaxies at high redshifts, toward cosmic noon. The aim of the present work is to obtain a z-dependent mid-infrared (MIR) photometric galaxy classification tool based on broad spectral emission and absorption lines using the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and its broadband filters. We used the largest Spitzer MIR spectral database to obtain synthetic photometry in the JWST/MIRI filters. We formed MIRI filter combinations to trace the strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features and the 9.7 micron silicate feature in seven redshift windows from z = 0.25-2.10. Results. We present z-dependent MIRI color-color plots that separate active galactic nuclei (AGN), star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and silicate absorption-dominated galaxies up to z$\sim$2. We applied the photometric MIR colors to the largest ($\sim$34 arcmin square) MIRI survey called the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), to identify AGN, SFGs, and Si-absorption dominated galaxies out to substantial redshifts. Our JWST/MIRI SFGs sample includes galaxies with total IR luminosities of $10^{9.2} \sim 10^{11.9} L_{\odot}$ at 0.9 $\leq$z < 1.57. The majority of them are consistent with the z$\sim$1 main sequence. We also identified the first examples of z$\sim$1 galaxies with deep silicate absorption.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop an effective description of the local cosmic environment, namely, for redshift $z \lesssim 0.1$, to quantify the bias induced by local structure on cosmological observables. Our approach models the metric of the nearby Universe as a superposition of multi-structured $\Lambda$-Szekeres patches, calibrated against the HAMLET peculiar velocity and density field reconstructions of Cosmicflows-4. From this framework we compute the fully inhomogeneous and anisotropic quasilocal expansion field predicted by our model, and use it to assess the impact of local structure on estimates of $H_0$. For this purpose we analyse low-redshift Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ catalogue. We find that accounting for the local structure increases the Hubble tension, yielding a shift in the best-fit value of the Hubble constant of order $\Delta H_0 \approx 0.5\ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$.
#### Observing spatial and temporal variations in the atmospheric chemistry of rocky exoplanets: prospects for mid-infrared spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Future telescopes such as the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) will enable mid-infrared characterisation of the atmospheres of nearby rocky exoplanets. Whilst 4D spatial and temporal variations of Earth as an exoplanet are below spectroscopic detection limits, such variability is planet-specific. We investigate LIFE's ability to detect 4D variability in the atmospheres of tidally locked exoplanets. We create daily synthetic LIFE observations of Proxima Centauri b in a 1:1 and an eccentric 3:2 spin-orbit resonance (SOR), using LIFEsim on spectra from daily 3D climate-chemistry model output of an aquaplanet with Earth-like composition. Hemispheric distributions of temperature, clouds, and chemical species determine spectral signatures and variability with orbital phase angle. Such variability dictates the extent to which parameters can be reliably inferred from snapshot spectra at arbitrary viewing geometries. In the 1:1 SOR, MIR spectra vary significantly with viewing geometry and indirectly probe atmospheric circulation. Nightside temperature inversions generate O3, CO2, and H2O emission features, though these lie below LIFE's detection threshold, and instead O3 features disappear at certain phase angles. In contrast, the 3:2 SOR yields a more homogeneous atmosphere with weaker phase variability but enhanced bolometric flux due to eccentric heating. Phase-resolved LIFE observations confidently distinguish between the SORs and capture seasonal O3 variability for golden targets like Proxima Centauri b. In case of abiotic O2/O3 build-up, the O3 variability presents a potential false positive scenario. Hence, LIFE can disentangle different spin-orbit states and resolve 4D atmospheric variability, enabling daily characterisation of the 4D physical and chemical state of nearby terrestrial worlds. Importantly, this characterisation requires phase-resolved rather than snapshot spectra.
#### The high-redshift radio galaxy 3C 294 at low frequencies: radio detection of the X-ray Ghost

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the very first radio detection associated with the peculiar hourglass-morphology X-rays surrounding 3C 294 at z=1.8. Using International Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) data at 144 MHz and Chandra data at 0.3-6 keV, we find that the co-spatial diffuse radio and X-ray emission is well described by synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes by the same electron population. Through modelling of this rare low-energy plasma, we find that the most defining property of the electrons up-scattering CMB photons at this redshift is very low electron Lorentz factors ($\gamma_{\text{max}}\ll 10^{4}$ and $\gamma_{\text{break}}\lesssim 10^{3}$) in the lobe: deep low frequency (<150 MHz) observations are critical to the detection of radio lobes at high redshift. The physical conditions imply a total energy in the diffuse emission significantly greater than that implied by the temperature of the protocluster gas: 3C 294 is one of the most powerful known radio-loud systems in a dense protocluster environment. Through resolved spectral analysis of archival radio data up to 15 GHz, we find evidence that the inner hotspots are due to restarted activity, while the outer hotspots remain energetic, suggesting a rapid duty cycle while the jet precesses. This allowed the low-energy aged plasma driving the X-rays to remain spatially distinct from the high-energy plasma. Together, our results promise a revelation of AGN-related radio emission at high redshift using future low-frequency arrays such as SKA-LOW.
#### On the Origin of Kinematic Structure in the Young Association Serpens OB2

 - **Abstract**
 The Serpens OB2 association (l ~ 18.5 deg, b ~ 1.9 deg, d = 1950 +/- 30 pc) is a large star-forming complex ~65 pc above the Galactic midplane, with a clumpy, elongated structure extending ~50 pc parallel to the plane. We analyse a sample of probable association members, including OB stars and low-to-intermediate-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) from the SPICY catalogue. While both populations are found throughout the association, the OB stars lie preferentially on the side nearest the Galactic plane, while the YSOs are generally younger and more strongly clustered around molecular-cloud clumps detected in 13CO MWISP data. Using Gaia DR3 proper motions to probe the association's internal kinematics, we find aligned stellar velocities on length scales <2 pc, two-point velocity statistics that show increasing velocity differences and predominantly divergent motions at larger separations, and distinct velocities for star clusters within the association. Finally, the association exhibits gradual, but statistically significant global expansion perpendicular to the Galactic plane, with a spatial gradient of 0.10 +/- 0.02 km/s/pc. The expansion of the H II region Sh 2-54, powered by the association's OB stars, may be accelerating the star-forming cloud away from the plane given the system's geometry, plausibly inducing the vertical stellar velocity gradient. The clumpy stellar distribution, correlated velocities on small scales, and increasingly divergent motions on larger scales are consistent with an initial velocity field inherited from a turbulent molecular cloud modified by stellar feedback. Ser OB2 demonstrates that the multi-scale expansion of an OB association can begin even while star formation is still ongoing throughout the complex.
