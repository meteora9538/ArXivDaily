 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of the Exploration of Local VolumE Survey - Field (ELVES-Field), a survey of the dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume (LV; $D<10$ Mpc) over roughly $3,000$ square degrees, focusing on the field dwarf population. Candidates are detected using a semi-automated algorithm tailored for low surface brightness dwarfs. Using tests with injected galaxies, we show the detection is $50\%$ complete to $m_g\sim20$ mag and $M_\star \sim 10^6$ $M_\odot$. Candidates are confirmed to be true nearby dwarfs through distance measurements including redshift, tip of the red giant branch, and surface brightness fluctuations. We identify isolated, field dwarfs using various environmental criteria. Over the survey footprint, we detect and confirm 95 LV dwarfs, 44 of which we consider isolated. Using this sample, we infer the field dwarf mass function and find good agreement at the high-mass end with previous redshift surveys and with the predictions of the IllustrisTNG simulation. This sample of isolated, field dwarfs represents a powerful dataset to investigate aspects of small-scale structure and the effect of environment on dwarf galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The nascent methodology of applying the principles of causal discovery to astrophysical data has produced affirming results about deeply held theories concerning the causal nature behind the observed coevolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with their host galaxies. The key results from observations have demonstrated an apparent causal reversal across different galaxy morphologies$\unicode{x2014}$SMBHs causally influence the evolution of the physical parameters of their spiral galaxy hosts, whereas SMBHs in elliptical galaxies are passive companions that grow in near lockstep with their hosts. To further explore and ascertain insights, it is necessary to utilize galaxy simulations to track the time evolution of the observed causal relations to learn more about the temporal nature of the changing SMBH/galaxy evolutionary directions. We conducted experiments with the NIHAO suite of cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations to follow the evolution of individual galaxies along with their central SMBH masses ($M_\unicode{x25CF}$) and properties, including central stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_0$). We reproduce the causal results from real galaxies, but add clarity by observing that the SMBH/galaxy causal directions are noticeably inverted between the epochs before and after the peak of star formation. The implications for causal reversal of the $M_\unicode{x25CF}\unicode{x2013}\sigma_0$ relation portend larger concerns about the reliability of SMBH masses estimated at high redshifts and presumptions of overmassive black holes at early epochs. Toward this problem, we apply updated causally-informed scaling relations that predict high-$z$ black hole masses that are approximately two orders of magnitude less massive, and thus not overmassive with respect to local $z=0$ SMBH$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy mass ratios.
#### ELVES-Field: Isolated Dwarf Galaxy Quenched Fractions Rise Below $M_* \approx 10^7$ $M_\odot$

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16778

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16778

 - **Abstract**
 We use a new sample of low-mass ($M_* < 10^9$ $M_\odot$) isolated galaxies from the Exploration of Local VolumE Survey - Field (ELVES-Field) to examine the star formation properties and sizes of field dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume (LV; $D<10$ Mpc). This volume-limited sample was selected from nearly 3,000 square degrees of imaging, relying on surface brightness fluctuations to determine distances to the majority of the systems and is complete to $M_* \approx 10^6$ $M_\odot$. Across the surveyed area, we catalog over 2300 candidate LV dwarfs, of which we confirm 95 as genuine LV members and reject over 1600 as background contaminants, with the remaining 600 candidates still requiring a distance measurement. Of the confirmed LV dwarfs, 46 are either new discoveries or confirmed via a distance measurement for the first time here. We explore different environmental criteria to select isolated dwarfs but primarily focus on dwarfs that are $>2\times R_{\mathrm{vir}}$ in projection from any known group with $M_\star > 10^9$ $M_\odot$. We find that, at higher dwarf masses ($M_\star \gtrsim 10^7$ $M_\odot$), essentially all field dwarfs are star-forming as has been found before. In contrast, at $M_\star \lesssim 10^7$ $M_\odot$, $\sim30\%$ of field dwarfs appear to be quenched. Finally, we find that isolated dwarfs are noticeably smaller ($\sim 20\%$) than satellite dwarfs of the same stellar mass, regardless of quenched status.

 - **Abstract**
 The solar-stellar connection provides a unique framework for understanding magnetic activity and atmospheric heating across a broad spectrum of stars. Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) of NASA, equipped with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, and Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment, has enabled detailed Sun-as-a-star studies that bridge solar and stellar physics. Integrating spatially resolved solar observations into disk-integrated datasets, these studies provide insights into magnetic activity occurring in distant stars. This review highlights key results from recent analyses that employed all three SDO instruments to characterize active regions, quantify universal heating relationships, and reconstruct stellar X-ray and ultraviolet spectra. We discuss how these findings advance our understanding of stellar magnetic activity, provide predictive tools for exoplanetary environments, and outline future directions for applying solar-based frameworks to diverse stellar populations.
#### Using EUV driven external photoevaporation to test viscous evolution of protoplanetary discs

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16801

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary discs are thought to evolve either through angular momentum transport driven by viscous processes or through angular momentum removal induced by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds. One proposed method to distinguish between these two evolutionary pathways is by comparing mass accretion rates and disc sizes, but observational constraints complicate this distinction. In this study, we investigate how extreme ultraviolet (EUV) external photoevaporation affects the evolution of protoplanetary discs, particularly in environments such as the Orion Nebula Cluster. Using a combination of analytical derivations and 1D numerical simulations, we explore the impact of externally induced mass-loss on disc structure and accretion dynamics. We demonstrate that, in the viscous scenario, there exists a clear, near one-to-one correlation between the mass-loss rate due to external photoevaporative outflows and the mass accretion rate onto the central star. In contrast, MHD wind-driven discs do not exhibit such trend, leading to a distinct evolutionary path. External photoevaporative mass-loss rates and mass accretion rates can both be accurately measured for a population of discs, without a strong model dependence. Thus, our findings provide a robust observational test to distinguish between viscous and MHD wind-driven disc evolution, offering a new approach to constraining angular momentum transport mechanisms in protoplanetary discs. Applying this diagnostic observationally requires joint measurements of $\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ and $\dot{M}_{\rm pe}$ for the same objects, which are currently scarce in bright HII regions due to contamination and sensitivity limitations.

 - **Abstract**
 OB stars generally form in open clusters within the Milky Way's thin disk, so when they are found at high Galactic latitudes, it is thought that they were ejected from their birth clusters during the past few tens of millions of years. Using Gaia Data Release 3 (hereafter DR3) data, we traced the kinematic trajectories of 39 high-latitude B-type stars and 447 Galactic open clusters with high-quality astrometry to search for moments of past intersection. In cases where we found matching trajectories, we also considered the clusters' HR diagrams to confirm parent-orphan pairs have matching ages. Further analysis of the clusters' core environments allowed us to determine a probable ejection mechanism. Through these paternity tests, we have identified possible origins for five of these orphaned B-type stars. Here we present the likely travel times, ejection velocities, and a discussion of the runaway mechanism for each case. We also identify one star whose trajectory did not bring it near the disk during the time period of our analysis, and we discuss its possible origins as well.
#### WFST Supernovae in the First Year: II. SN 2024aedt: Systematical Study of a Transitional Type Ia Supernova

 - **Abstract**
 We present comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of a transitional type Ia SN 2024aedt, discovered by the 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) within one day of the explosion. Its light curve is characterized by a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B = -18.49 \pm 0.03$ mag and a decline rate of $\Delta m_{15}(B) = 1.53 \pm 0.36$ mag, placing the object on the $\Delta m_{15}(B)$--$M_B$ diagram in the transition region between normal and subluminous SNe Ia. Furthermore, the early-color evolution and host galaxy environment of SN 2024aedt underscore its transitional nature, sharing properties with both normal and 91bg-like SNe Ia. Light-curve modeling with MOSFiT yields a synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mass of $0.414 \pm 0.042\,M_{\odot}$ and a total ejecta mass of $0.548 \pm 0.108\,M_{\odot}$. A comparison with theoretical models suggests that the evolutionary trend can be broadly explained by both delayed-detonation (DDT) and double-detonation (DDet) scenarios while possible early-excess emissions predicted by DDet cannot be identified given the limited detections soon after the SN explosion. Although the overall spectral evolution of SN 2024aedt is similar to that of other transitional SNe Ia, the spectroscopic comparison reveals diversity in the early-phase blue-end features, which becomes more homogeneous at later phases. The result indicates the importance of early-time observations in understanding the origin of SN Ia diversity.

 - **Abstract**
 Lithium plays a unique role in astrophysics, as it is a powerful diagnostic for the physics and evolution of low-mass stars, Galactic archaeology, and cosmology. We review the Li observations in stars at different phases of their evolution, the strengths and the limitations of the current theoretical stellar models to explain the Li abundance data, our understanding of the Li sources and of the evolution of Li through- out the Galactic history. Key takeaways from the current state of the research in the field are: 1) Stellar evolution models accounting for fundamental transport processes of chemical species and angular momentum hold the promise of providing a common stellar Li depletion explanation to the Li abundance patterns observed in all Galactic stellar populations, including the dip and the plateau(s). 2) Novae are most probably the main source of Li in the Galaxy, on observational (but not yet theoretically established) grounds. 3) Radial migration of stars in the Galactic disk holds the key to understand many aspects of the Li evolution in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new method for solving the relativistic Vlasov--Maxwell system of equations, applicable to a wide range of extreme high-energy-density astrophysical and laboratory environments. The method directly discretizes the kinetic equation on a high-dimensional phase-space grid using a discontinuous Galerkin finite element approach, yielding a high-order, conservative numerical scheme that is free from the Poisson noise inherent to traditional Monte-Carlo methods. A novel and flexible velocity-space mapping technique enables the efficient treatment of the wide range of energy scales characteristic of relativistic plasmas, including QED pair-production discharges, instabilities in strongly magnetized plasmas surrounding neutron stars, and relativistic magnetic reconnection. Our noise-free approach is capable of providing unique insight into plasma dynamics, enabling detailed analysis of electromagnetic emission and fine-scale phase-space structure.

 - **Abstract**
 UV slopes ($\beta$) are a powerful diagnostics for galaxies at the Epoch of Reionization, tracing star formation, ISM ionization, and the escape fraction $f_{esc}$ of ionizing photons. Studies at low and intermediate z find a gradual $\beta$ reddening with time and steeper slopes for fainter galaxies, however recent JWST studies reveal a flattening of this trend at $z>7$. We want measure $\beta$ for galaxies at $z>7.5$ using the strong lensing around massive galaxy clusters to observe high-redshift and faint galaxies. The low-brightness regime is of particular interest for reionization, as most of the recent models of this process posit that numerous faint galaxies are the prime drivers of reionization. We use NIRCam and NIRSpec data from CANUCS, Technicolor, JUMPS, Silver Bullet, UNCOVER and MEGASCIENCE across 7 strong lensing fields. We find galaxies down to $M_{UV}\sim-16$ and 7.5<z<12.5. We measure \b{eta} with a forward-modelling procedure and estimate $f_{esc}$ for a subsample with emission line data using a relation, calibrated from a low-z sample, with UV slope, galaxy size and H$\beta$ equivalent width. We find 378 galaxies (45 with spectrum), yielding average values $\beta=-2.3\pm0.4$, $z=8.5\pm1.0$, and $M_{UV}=-18\pm1$. We find no significant $\beta$ evolution across our redshift range, suggesting a flattening of the $\beta-z$ trend above $z\sim7.5$. We find a weak negative trend between $\beta$ and $M_{UV}$. For 14 galaxies we estimate an average $f_{esc}=0.26\pm0.22$. The flat trend of $\beta$ at $z>7.5$ suggests similar properties between $300$ and $600 Myr$ after the Big Bang. The weak trend between $\beta$ and $M_{UV}$ suggests an analogous composition for low- and high-mass galaxies' ISM, likely due to a lack of time for dust buildup. While average $f_{esc}$ is higher than necessary to ionize the IGM by z~6, the model extrapolated at low-z may overestimate its value.
#### Interstellar Formation of Thioethanal (CH$_{3}$CHS). Gas-Phase and Ice-Surface Mechanisms involving Secondary Sulfur Products

 - **Abstract**
 The formation pathways of sulfur-bearing species in the interstellar medium are crucial to understand astrochemical processes in cold molecular clouds and to gain new insights about the sulfur budget in these regions. We aim to explore the recently detected, thioethanal (CH$_{3}$CHS) formation mechanisms from thioethanol (CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH) as a precursor in addition to secondary sulfur products. The electronic structure methods and density functional theory for both gas-phase and ice-grain surface environments is employed. To mimic interstellar ice-mantles, we use medium (W6) and large amorphized (W22) water clusters as implemented in Binding Energy Evaluation protocol. A barrierless formation mechanism for CH$_{3}$CHS under low-temperature interstellar conditions is identified, in the gas phase. Surface environments modulate activation barriers in a site-specific manner, elucidated through both Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal initiated surface reaction pathways. Compared to oxygen analogs, sulfur chemistry enables alternate pathways due to weaker S-H bonding, with a competing route forming ethane-1,1-di-thiol (CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH), on the ice-grain surface, potentially reducing CH$_{3}$CHS yields. The first accurate binding energy for thioethanol on water ice is also reported, confirming its greater volatility than ethanol. The proposed mechanism offers a tentative hypothesis for the apparent mutual exclusive detections of the CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH and CH$_{3}$CHS in TMC-1, Orion, and Sgr B2(N), that further requires validation through quantitative astrochemical modeling and also to distinguish this chemical differentiation from observational sensitivity limitations. These qualitative findings highlight the multifaceted chemical behavior of sulfur-bearing organics in the interstellar medium and support CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH as promising astro-chemical targets.
