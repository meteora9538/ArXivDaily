 - **Abstract**
 Over the past few years \textit{JWST} has been a major workhorse in detecting and constraining the metal enrichment of the first galaxies in the early Universe and finding the source of the ionisation of their interstellar medium. In this work, we present new deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of GS-z11-1, a galaxy at z = 11.28, in which we report the detection of multiple rest-frame UV and optical emission lines: CIII]$\lambda\lambda$1907,09, CIV]$\lambda\lambda$1548,51, [OII]$\lambda\lambda$3726,29, [NeIII]$\lambda$3869, H$\gamma$ and tentative evidence for HeII$\lambda$1640. The ionisation properties of GS-z11-1 are consistent with star formation, with potential contribution from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We estimate a galaxy stellar mass of log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$) = 7.8$\pm$0.2 and log(SFR/(M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$))= 0.32$\pm$0.11 for the fiducial SF-only models. We measured C/O from the SED modelling of C/O = 1.20$\pm0.15 \times$ solar. This is one of the highest C/O abundances at z$>$10, and it is consistent with either PopII and PopIII enrichment paths. Despite this source being extremely compact, with a half-light radius of 73$\pm$10 pc, we see no increased equivalent width of NIV] and NIII] emission lines as seen in some other compact sources at similar redshifts, a potential signature of second-generation stars in GCs. Overall, this galaxy exhibits low metallicity and high ionisation parameter consistent with intense star-formation or AGN activity in the early Universe, possibly observed before the enrichment by the second generation of stars in proto-globular clusters in the core of the galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Simulating black hole (BH) accretion and feedback from the horizon to galactic scales is extremely challenging, as it involves a vast range of scales. Recently, our multizone method has successfully achieved global dynamical steady-states of hot accretion flows in three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations by tracking the bidirectional interaction between a non-spinning BH and its host galaxy. In this paper, we present technical improvements to the method and apply it to spin $a_*=0.9$ BHs, which power relativistic jets. We first test the new multizone set-up with a smaller Bondi radius, $R_B\approx400\,r_g$, where $r_g$ is the gravitational radius. The strongly magnetized accretion launches a relativistic jet with an intermediate feedback efficiency $\eta\sim30\,\%$, in between that of a prograde ($\eta\sim100\,\%$) and retrograde ($\eta\sim 10\,\%$) torus. Interestingly, both prograde and retrograde simulations also eventually converge to the same intermediate efficiency when evolved long enough, as accumulated magnetic fields remove gas rotation. We then extend strongly magnetized simulations to larger Bondi radii, $R_B\approx 2\times10^3,~2\times 10^4,~2\times 10^5\,r_g$. We find that the BH accretion rate $\dot{M}$ is suppressed with respect to the Bondi rate $\dot{M}_B$ as $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_B\propto R_B^{-1/2}$. However, despite some variability, the time-averaged feedback efficiency is $\eta\sim30\,\%$, independent of $R_B$. This suggests that BH feedback efficiency in hot accretion flows is mainly governed by the BH spin ($a_*$) rather than by the galactic properties ($R_B$). From these first-principles simulations, we provide a feedback subgrid prescription for cosmological simulations: $\dot{E}_{\rm fb}=2\times10^{-3}[R_B/(2\times10^5\,r_g)]^{-1/2}\dot{M}_Bc^2$ for BH spin $a_*=0.9$.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation from metal-free gas, the hallmark of the first generation of Population III stars, was long assumed to occur in the very early Universe. We report the discovery of MPG-CR3 (Metal-Pristine Galaxy COSMOS Redshift 3; hereafter CR3), an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift $z= 3.193\pm0.016$. From JWST, VLT, and Subaru observations, CR3 exhibits exceptionally strong Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and He I $\lambda$10830 emission. We measure rest-frame equivalent widths of EW$_0$(Ly$\alpha$) $\approx822$ Angstrom and EW$_0$(H$\alpha$) $\approx2814$ Angstrom, among the highest seen in star-forming systems. No metal lines, e.g. [O III] $\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, C IV $\lambda\lambda1548,1550$, are currently detected at statistically significant level, placing a 2-$\sigma$ abundance upper limit of 12+log(O/H) < 6.52 ($Z < 8\times10^{-3}\ Z_\odot$). The observed Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ flux ratio is $\approx13.9$, indicating negligible dust attenuation. Spectral energy distribution modeling with Pop III stellar templates indicates a very young ($\sim2$ Myr), low-mass ($M_* \approx 6.1\times 10^5 M_\odot$) stellar population. Further, the photometric redshifts reveal that CR3 could reside in a slightly underdense environment ($\delta \approx -0.12$). CR3 provides evidence that first-generation star formation could persist well after the epoch of reionization, challenging the conventional view that pristine star formation ended by $z\gtrsim6$.

 - **Abstract**
 The X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) is the seventh Japanese X-ray observatory whose development and operation are in collaboration with universities and research institutes in Japan, the United States, and Europe, including JAXA, NASA, and ESA. The telemetry data downlinked from the satellite are reduced to scientific products using pre-pipeline (PPL) and pipeline (PL) software running on standard Linux virtual machines (VMs) for the JAXA and NASA sides, respectively. OBSIDs identified the observations, and we had 80 and 161 OBSIDs to be reprocessed at the end of the commissioning period and performance verification and calibration period, respectively. The combination of the containerized PPL utilizing Singularity of a container platform running on the JAXA's "TOKI-RURI" high-performance computing (HPC) system and working disk images formatted to ext3 accomplished a 33x speedup in PPL tasks over our regular VM. Herein, we briefly describe the data processing in XRISM and our porting strategies for PPL in the HPC environment.

 - **Abstract**
 The MeerKAT Fornax Survey is conducting a thorough examinationof the nearby Fornax galaxy cluster to understand how galaxies lose their cold gas and stop forming stars in low-mass clusters (M$_{\rm vir} \leq 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$). We are doing so through very deep (down to $\sim 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$) and high resolution (up to$\sim~ 1$ kpc and 1 km s$^{-1}$) MeerKAT observations of neutral atomic hydrogen gas (HI) in a $1\times2$ Mpc$^2$ region centred on Fornax. At the time of writing, the survey is $88\%$ complete. Initial analysis of the cluster's central area has unveiled the widespread existence of previously unseen HI tails and clouds. Some of the HI is clearly being removed from Fornax galaxies as they interact with one another or with the intra-cluster medium. We present a sample of galaxies with long, one-sided, star-less HI tails (of which only one was previously known) radially oriented within the cluster. The properties of these tails represent the first conclusive evidence that ram pressure is a key force shaping the distribution of HI in the Fornax cluster. Furthermore, interactions within the Fornax environment shape the HI mass function, the HI content of dwarf galaxies and determines how the HI sustains the nuclear activity of some cluster members and neighbouring galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Fermi-type shear particle acceleration is a promising mechanism for sustaining ultra-relativistic particles along the kilo-parsec scale jets in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). We explore the possibility of synchrotron-limited electron acceleration in mildly relativistic shearing flows and present numerical solutions to the corresponding particle transport equation. We compare our findings with analytical calculations to infer an effective electron cutoff energy, and discuss the relationship to a simplified box model treatment. The results show that mildly relativistic large-scale jets offer a suitable environment for distributed electron acceleration beyond Lorentz factors of $\gamma_e \sim 10^8$.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18185

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to construct a comprehensive global multi-scale kinematic equilibrium radiative-transfer model for the pre-transitional disc of DoAr 44 (Haro 1-16, V2062 Oph) in the Ophiuchus star-forming region. This model integrates diverse observational datasets to describe the system, spanning from the accretion region to the outer disc. Our analysis utilises a large set of observational data, including ALMA continuum complex visibilities, VLTI/GRAVITY continuum squared visibilities, closure phases, and triple products, as well as VLT/UVES and VLT/X-shooter H-alpha spectra. Additionally, we incorporated absolute flux measurements from ground-based optical observatories, Spitzer, IRAS, the Submillimeter Array, the IRAM, or the ATCA radio telescopes. These data sets were used to constrain the structure and kinematics of the object through radiative-transfer modelling. Our model reveals that the spectral line profiles are best explained by an optically thin spherical inflow/outflow within the co-rotation radius of the star, exhibiting velocities exceeding 380 km/s. The VLTI near-infrared interferometric observations are consistent with an inner disc extending from 0.1 to 0.2 au. The ALMA sub-millimetre observations indicate a dust ring located between 36 and 56 au, probably related to the CO2 condensation line. The global density and temperature profiles derived from our model provide insight into an intermediate disc, located in the terrestrial planet-forming zone, which has not yet been spatially resolved.
#### Bridging the gap: consistent modeling of protoplanetary disk heating and gap formation by planet-induced spiral shocks

 - **Abstract**
 A giant planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk excites spiral density waves, which steepen into shocks as they propagate away from the planet. These shocks lead to secular disk heating and gap opening, both of which can have important implications for the evolution of solids near the planet. To date, these two effects have largely been modeled independently. In this study, we present a self-consistent model that unifies these processes by linking shock heating and angular momentum deposition through the entropy jumps across the spiral shocks. We show that the model accurately reproduces the temperature and surface density profiles around the planet's orbit, as obtained from two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with standard $\alpha$ viscosity and $\beta$ thermal relaxation prescriptions. Furthermore, by incorporating an empirically derived scaling law for the radial distribution of the entropy jump, we construct a fully analytic model that self-consistently predicts the temperature and surface density structures of disks hosting a giant planet. This work represents a first step toward understanding how early-formed giant planets influence the formation of second-generation planets and planetesimals in their vicinity.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy interactions can disturb gas in galactic discs, compress it, excite it, and enhance star formation. An intriguing system likely consisting of two interacting galaxies overlapping on the line-of-sight was previously studied through ionised gas observations from the integral-field spectrograph Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA). A decomposition into two components using MaNGA spectra, together with a multi-wavelength study, allowed to characterise the system as a minor-merger with interaction-induced star-formation, and maybe AGN activity. We use new interferometric observations of the CO(1-0) gas of this system from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) to confront and combine the spatially-resolved ionised and molecular gas observations. Mock NOEMA and MaNGA data are computed from simulated systems of two discs and compared to the observations. The NOEMA observations of the molecular gas, dynamically colder than the ionised gas, help to precise the configuration of the system, which we revisit as being a major merger. Combination of ionised and molecular gas data allow us to study the star-formation efficiency of the system.
#### EP250108a/SN2025kg: A Magnetar-powered Gamma-Ray Burst Supernova Originating from a Close Helium-star Binary via Isolated Binary Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 SN\,2025kg, linked to EP250108a, is among the brightest broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN Ic-BL) known, showing unique helium absorptions, a late-time broad H$\alpha$, and an early bump. In this {\em{Letter}}, we propose a jet-cocoon origin to explain EP250108a as off-axis cooling emission from a mildly relativistic inner cocoon viewed at $\sim45^\circ$ and the early bump of SN\,2025kg as the outer cocoon cooling emission, both constraining an energy of $\sim(1-2)\times10^{52}{\rm{erg}}$ and a progenitor radius of $\sim5\,R_\odot$. To explain SN\,2025kg's exceptionally luminous peak, potential energy injection into the $\sim2.5\,M_\odot$ ejecta from a magnetar with initial period $\sim1.7\,{\rm{ms}}$ and magnetic field $\sim2\times10^{15}{\rm{G}}$ may be required, implying a rapidly rotating $\sim4\,M_\odot$ progenitor. Thus, the progenitor may be a low-mass helium star with an extended helium envelope, supported by helium absorption lines and an inferred weak pre-SN wind. Hydrogen-rich material may reside in the inner ejecta layers, as suggested by the late-time broad H$\alpha$, possibly originating from main-sequence companion material evaporated by the magnetar wind. Since the observed near-solar metallicity challenges the popular quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution channel, the rapidly rotating helium-star progenitor of EP250108a/SN\,2025kg might attain angular momentum by being tidally spun up by a main-sequence companion in a close binary formed through isolated binary evolution.
#### Galaxy quenching across the Cosmic Web: disentangling mass and environment with SDSS DR18

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18614

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the influence of large-scale cosmic web environments on galaxy quenching using a volume-limited, stellar mass-matched galaxy sample from SDSS DR18. Galaxies are classified as residing in sheets, filaments, or clusters based on the eigenvalues of the tidal tensor derived from the smoothed density field. The quenched fraction increases with stellar mass and is highest in clusters, intermediate in filaments, and lowest in sheets, reflecting the increasing efficiency of environmental quenching with density. A flattening of the quenched fraction beyond $\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \sim 10.6$ across all environments signals a transition from environment-driven to mass-driven quenching. In contrast, the bulge fraction continues to rise beyond this threshold, indicating a decoupling between star formation suppression and morphological transformation. At the high-mass end ($\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \gtrsim 11.5$), both quenched and bulge fractions bifurcate, increasing in clusters but declining in sheets, suggesting a divergent evolutionary pathway where massive galaxies in sheets retain cold gas and disk-like morphologies, potentially sustaining or rejuvenating star formation. The AGN fraction also increases with stellar mass and is somewhat higher in sheets than in clusters, indicating enhanced AGN activity in low-density, gas-rich environments. The high-mass trends are independently corroborated by our analysis of specific star formation rate, $(u-r)$ colour, concentration index, and D4000 in the stellar mass-density plane, which show that massive galaxies in sheets remain bluer, younger, more star-forming, and structurally less evolved than their cluster counterparts. Our results highlight the cosmic web as an active driver of galaxy evolution.
