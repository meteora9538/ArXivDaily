 - **Abstract**
 Saturnian moon Titan presents a compelling testbed for probing prebiotic chemistry beyond early Earth. Impact-generated melt pools provide transient aqueous habitats in an otherwise cryogenic environment. We use Cantera equilibrium models to assess whether mixtures of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), acetylene (C2H2), and ammonia (NH3) can drive amino acid synthesis in Selk-sized craters. Across twenty-one amino acids (twenty proteinogenic plus beta-alanine), NH3-free systems yield only proline, alanine, and beta-alanine, whereas adding as little as 1% NH3 (relative to H2O) renders almost the full suite accessible, with yields peaking at 2% and tapering thereafter. The NH3-free alanine result implies alternative pathways beyond classical Strecker or aminonitrile hydrolysis, suggesting acetylene, abundant on Titan but scarce on early Earth, as a plausible feedstock. We identify acrylonitrile (detected on Titan) as a thermodynamically favorable intermediate that can convert to alanine under aqueous conditions in an NH3-free pathway. For glycine and alanine production from nitrile hydrolysis, comparison with laboratory kinetics shows that our equilibrium models predict near-complete conversion, while observed rates yield only partial products over weeks. Yet estimated chemical equilibration times (years-centuries) are far shorter than melt lifetimes, supporting plausibility of equilibrium in situ. These predictions are directly testable with Dragonfly mass spectrometer (DraMS), for which we recommend pre-flight standards to test proline, alanine, beta-alanine, cysteine, and methionine. The first three offer the best chances for amino acid detection regardless of ammonia availability; the latter two offer diagnostic tools for determining the presence of reactive sulfur in post-impact Titan ponds.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we introduce the SEEDZ simulations, a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations exploring the formation and growth of the first massive black holes in the Universe. SEEDZ includes models for Population III star formation, supernovae explosions and the resulting formation of light seed black holes, metal enrichment and subsequent Population II star formation, heavy seed black hole formation, Eddington and super-Eddington accretion schemes as well as black hole feedback. In this paper, we cover the overall methodologies employed and present our current results at $z=15$. Our main result so far is that black holes initially grow faster than their host galaxy, and hence over-massive black holes are a feature of the high-redshift Universe. The fundamental black hole-galaxy relationships we observe at $z = 0$ (especially the M$_{\rm BH}$ - M$_*$ relationship) likely only emerge in more mature galaxies. At high-redshift, that relationship has not yet been established. We find that even at these high redshifts, MBHs can grow from their initial heavy seed mass of $\sim$10$^4$ M$_\odot$ up to 10$^6$ M$_\odot$. At the high end of our MBH masses, our simulated galaxy M$_{\rm BH}$ - M$_*$ relations match the observed high redshift trends i.e. over-massive BHs with M$_{\rm BH}$/M$_{\rm star} \sim 10^{-2}$. This initial set of simulations will continue to run down to $z=10$, where we will perform a comprehensive comparison of simulated MBH number densities and M$_{\rm BH}$ - M$_*$ relations with JWST observations. Further simulations with higher resolution will then follow.

 - **Abstract**
 Quantitative morphology provides a key probe of galaxy evolution across cosmic time and environments. However, these metrics can be biased by changes in imaging quality - resolution and depth - either across the survey area or the sample. To prepare for the upcoming Rubin LSST data, we investigate this bias for all metrics measured by statmorph and single-component Sérsic fitting with Galfit. We find that geometrical measurements (ellipticity, axis ratio, Petrosian radius, and effective radius) are fairly robust at most depths and resolutions. Light concentration measurements ($C$, Gini, $M_{20}$) systematically decrease with resolution, leading low-mass or high-redshift bulge-dominated sources to appear indistinguishable from disks. Sérsic index $n$, while unbiased, suffers from a 20-40% uncertainty due to degeneracies in the Sérsic fit. Disturbance measurements ($A$, $A_S$, $D$) depend on signal-to-noise and are thus affected by noise and surface-brightness dimming. We quantify this dependence for each parameter, offer empirical correction functions, and show that the evolution in $C$ observed in JWST galaxies can be explained purely by observational biases. We propose two new measurements - isophotal asymmetry $A_X$ and substructure $St$ - that aim to resolve some of these biases. Finally, we provide a Python package statmorph-lsst implementing these changes and a full dataset that enables tests of custom functions (see text for links).

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The presence of a stellar companion can strongly influence the architecture and long-term stability of planetary systems. Motivated by the discovery of exoplanets exhibiting extremely high eccentricities (e >= 0.8) in systems with a binary companion, we investigate how planetary orbits around one star (S-type configuration) evolve under the gravitational perturbations of the companion. Aims. We aim to assess the role of a stellar companion in shaping the orbital evolution of S-type planets and to explore whether dynamical interactions in such environments can account for the formation of highly eccentric planets. Methods. We performed a suite of N-body simulations, modeling systems initially composed of three Jupiter-mass planets on nearly circular, coplanar orbits around the primary star. We systematically varied the semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination of the stellar companion, to characterize the conditions under which extreme eccentricities can be excited. Results. Our results show that dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering and secular mechanisms--including the von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov effect induced by the binary--often act together to produce abrupt and significant changes in planetary orbital evolution, with the outcome strongly dependent on the binary separation. The binary's eccentricity primarily dictates the number of surviving planets, while its inclination not only governs the final eccentricities of those survivors but also drives their orbits to align with the binary plane. Our simulations successfully reproduce the high eccentricities and compact orbits observed in four observed systems, showing close agreement between the modeled configurations and the actual systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Through 3D hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the impact of Type Ia supernova (SN) explosions on the star formation history and chemical properties of second-generation (SG) stars in young globular clusters with masses of 10^5-10^6 Msun. We assume that the SG is formed out of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) ejecta of first-generation stars plus pristine interstellar medium gas which is modelled as a uniform gas moving at a constant velocity towards the cluster. We tested two values for the infalling gas density of 10^(-24) and 10^(23) g/cm^3. Type Ia SNe start to explode together with the release of gas from the most massive AGB stars. Three simulated models are analyzed. In the low-mass and low-density scenario, we find that SNe Ia quench star formation which however restarts when the gas cools down again in between two explosions. SG stars are dominated by a He-rich population (Y>0.33), which is poorly diluted by pristine gas. In the high-mass models, star formation is mildly affected, while the He composition is significantly altered as exploding SNe prevent the accretion of pristine gas and therefore extremely helium-rich stars form. In the high-density model, such weak gas accretion leads to a maximum enhancement in helium mass fraction much larger than the observed one and not correlating with the initial cluster mass as found in models without Type Ia SNe. As for the iron content, small spreads have been found in all models, but the SG is less homogeneous than the FG, at variance with current observations.
#### A precessing magnetic jet as the engine of GRB 250702B

 - **Abstract**
 GRB 250702B shows ultra long, episodic prompt activity, with three hard gamma ray episodes over about 3.2 h with quasi regular spacing P ~ 2825 s, preceded by a soft X ray flare about one day earlier. We interpret these phenomena with a unified scenario in which a stellar mass black hole accretes from a massive, misaligned debris disk and launches a magnetically dominated, precessing, structured (spine sheath) jet. The engine clock arises from Lense Thirring precession of the outer annulus of a geometrically thick inner torus at radius r ~ 250 to 300 gravitational radii, while the hard spectra reflect magnetic reconnection dissipation in the spine. A slightly off axis viewing geometry resolves the apparent opening angle tension without invoking late energy injection. "Missing" pulses in the second and third cycles occur naturally when low amplitude nutation causes the beaming cone to miss the line of sight. The model yields concrete, falsifiable predictions, providing a self consistent explanation of GRB 250702B radiative and outflow anomalies.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the evolution of the star-forming fraction ($F_{\mathrm{sf}}$) of Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) at $z<0.8$, using the galaxy clusters identified from the Legacy Imaging Surveys from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Star-forming galaxies are identified using the $g-z$ color, and $F_{\mathrm{sf}}$ is measured as a function of redshift, cluster halo mass, and galaxy stellar mass. Field galaxies are used as a comparison sample to reduce selection effects. For BCGs, $F_{\mathrm{sf}}$ increases with redshift, showing a slow rise below $z \sim 0.4 - 0.5$ and a more rapid increase above this range. In contrast, $F_{\mathrm{sf}}$ decreases with increasing cluster halo mass and BCG stellar mass. At the low stellar mass end, BCGs exhibit higher star-forming fractions than field galaxies, suggesting enhanced star formation likely fueled by cold gas accretion from the intracluster medium. Also, star-forming BCGs tend to show larger projected offsets from the optical cluster density peak than quenching BCGs, indicating ongoing assembly. The analysis of the specific star formation rate (sSFR) further indicates a transition in the dominant mechanism driving star formation in BCGs: cooling flows are likely responsible at low redshift, while gas-rich mergers play a greater role at higher redshift. The shift in dominance occurs around $z \sim 0.5$, aligning with the steep rise in $F_{\mathrm{sf}}$ of BCG.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we study the rotational velocities of a sample of blue straggler stars (BSSs) and reference stars belonging to the Galactic globular cluster NGC 1851, using high-resolution spectra acquired with FLAMES-GIRAFFE at the ESO/VLT. After field decontamination based on radial velocities and proper motions, the final sample of member stars is composed of 15 BSSs and 45 reference stars populating the red giant and horizontal branches of the cluster. In agreement with previous findings, the totality of reference stars has negligible rotation (lower than 15 km/s). In contrast, we find high values of rotational velocity (up to $\sim$ 150 km/s) for a sub-sample of BSSs. By defining the threshold for fast rotating BSSs at 40 km/s, we found 4 fast-rotating BSSs out of 15, corresponding to a percentage of 27 $\pm$ 14 %. This results delineates a monotonically decreasing trend (instead of a step function) between the percentage of fast spinning BSSs and the central concentration and density of the host cluster, supporting a scenario where recent BSS formation preferentially occurs in low-density environments from the evolution of binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze observational data on methanol masers in the disks of young massive stellar objects in the massive star formation regions: NGC6334I, G33.641-0.228, G12.89+0.49. Special attention is paid to analysis of the magnetic fields and their possible connection with maser flares. For this purpose, we estimate the distance from star to maser, the magnetospheric radius and magnetic field strength in the region of this radius. The distances from stars to masing regions lie in range from 380 to 620 au. Stellar and disk's magnetic field strengths are comparable at the magnetosphere boundary and lie in the range from 590 to 1880 G for considered objects. Our estimates show that the magnetic fields may play an important role in the considered regions. In particular, observed luminosity bursts and maser flares may be related to magnetic reconnection events near the stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. True spin-orbit obliquities {\Psi} offer valuable insights into the evolutionary history of exoplanetary systems. Previous studies have suggested that exoplanets tend to occupy either aligned or perpendicular orbits. However, recent research has indicated potential biases caused by the low sample, questioning whether this dichotomy would persist with a larger dataset. Simultaneously, a similar dichotomous behavior has been suggested for Neptune-sized planets. Aims. We aim to investigate the distribution of true spin-orbit obliquities {\Psi} with an enlarged sample, looking for confirmation of the disputed dichotomy previously found, with a focus also on the obliquities of Neptunes. Methods. Starting from a sample of 264 projected obliquities {\lambda}, we homogeneously compute true obliquities {\Psi} for 116 planets using the rotation period method. We combine them with 4 further values gathered from literature and we then study their distribution, also as a function of various star-planet system parameters. Results. Our data-driven work based on 120 true obliquities {\Psi} - the largest sample to date - strongly confirms the presence of a single cluster of aligned planets, followed by an isotropic distribution of misaligned planets with no preferred misalignment. This result is based on a uniform distribution of stellar inclinations {i_\star} , for which non-uniformity could have biased previous interpretations of the arrangement of true obliquities. We confirm that Neptunians show a tentative dichotomous distribution with data available today, but its veracity needs confirmation with an enlarged sample, also because an anisotropic distribution of stellar inclination may be one of the factors hindering the real distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Our study investigates the properties of Alfvén waves in partially ionised solar plasmas in the presence of steady, field-aligned, flows of charged and neutral particles. Our work aims to understand how such flows modify wave propagation and damping in environments where ion-neutral collisions are significant. We employ a two-fluid model that treats ions and neutrals as separate, colliding fluids and incorporates background steady flows for both species. Using a combination of analytical dispersion analysis and numerical solutions, we examine the impact of these flows on the behaviour of Alfvén waves. Our results show that steady flows lead to substantial modifications of wave properties, including Doppler shifts, propagation direction reversal, flow-dependent changes in damping rates, and the appearance of a new mode associated with neutral flow and collisional coupling. We also identify conditions under which flow-driven mode conversion can arise. Our results offer new insights into the interplay between plasma flows and particle collisions in the regions of the solar atmosphere where partial ionisation is relevant.

 - **Abstract**
 The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) mission launched from Wanaka New Zealand on May 13, 2023. The mission ended after 36 h due to a balloon leak that resulted in the payload being lost in the Pacific Ocean. Over the course of the mission, the onboard Cherenkov Telescope (CT) was pointed just below the Earth's limb to search for optical signals from upward-moving extensive air showers that were induced by decaying tau-leptons that were generated by the conversion of $>10$ PeV tau-neutrinos in Earth. Such very-high energy (VHE) neutrinos may be produced in several classes of astrophysical sources that are suspected of possibly accelerating particles to ultra-high energies. In this contribution, we discuss the EUSO-SPB2 Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) campaign to search for VHE neutrino signals coming from astrophysical sources that crossed the CT's field of view ($6.4^\circ \times 12.8^\circ$). We also present a new software tool designed for scheduling observations, the Neutrino Target Scheduler, that we developed to support the ToO campaign. We also calculate upper limits on the neutrino fluences from sources observed during the ToO campaign. Our observations demonstrate the viability of conducting ToO follow-up observations from a near space environment with future balloon missions, such as the pathfinder mission POEMMA-Balloon with Radio.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate null depth retrieval is critical in nulling interferometry. However, achieving accurate null depth calibration is challenging due to various noise sources, instrumental imperfections, and the complexity of real observational environments. These challenges necessitate advanced calibration techniques that can efficiently handle such uncertainties while maintaining a high accuracy. This paper aims to incorporate machine-learning techniques with a Bayesian inference to improve the accuracy and efficiency of null depth retrieval in nulling interferometry. Specifically, it explores the use of neural posterior estimation (NPE) to develop models that overcome the computational limitations of conventional methods, such as numerical self-calibration (NSC), providing a more robust solution for accurate null depth calibration. An NPE-based model was developed, with a simulator that incorporates real data to better represent specific conditions. The model was tested on both synthetic and observational data from the LBTI nuller for evaluation. The NPE model successfully demonstrated improved efficiency, achieving results comparable to current methods in use. It achieved a null depth retrieval accuracy down to a few $10^{-4}$ on real observational data, matching the performance of conventional approaches while offering significant computational advantages, reducing the data retrieval time to one-quarter of the time required by self-calibration methods. The NPE model presents a practical and scalable solution for null depth calibration in nulling interferometry, offering substantial improvements in efficiency over existing methods with a better precision and application to other interferometric techniques.
#### Correlations of ALMA CO(2-1) with JWST mid-infrared fluxes down to scale of $\lesssim$100 parsec in nearby star-forming galaxies from PHANGS

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the correlations of CO (2-1) emission (${I_{\rm CO}}$) with PAH (${I_{\rm F770W, PAH}}$ and ${I_{\rm F1130W}}$) and dust (${I_{\rm F2100W}}$) emission down to scales of $\lesssim$ 100 pc, by applying \raddest, a novel regression technique recently developed by T. Jing & C. Li (2025) that effectively handles uncertainties and outliers in datasets, to 19 nearby star-forming galaxies in the PHANGS sample. We find that for the majority of the data points in all galaxies, the scaling of ${I_{\rm CO}}$ with ${I_{\rm F770W, PAH}}$, ${I_{\rm F1130W}}$, and ${I_{\rm F2100W}}$ can be well described by log-linear relations, though with substantial dependence on ionization conditions (i.e., HII-like, composite-like, and AGN-like). Under given ionization conditions, significant galaxy-to-galaxy variations are identified, and are primarily attributed to variations of intercept $b$, which exhibits clear bimodality. This bimodality is related to the overall host galaxy star formation strength. The differences in slope $k$ and intrinsic scatter $\sigma$ across different MIR bands (${I_{\rm F770W, PAH}}$, ${I_{\rm F1130W}}$, and ${I_{\rm F2100W}}$) are minor compared to their galaxy-to-galaxy variations. All parameters ($k$, $b$, and $\sigma$) depend on the spatial scale of measurement, suggesting that the coupling among CO, PAH, and dust is regulated by different mechanisms at varying scales. We identify non-log-linear behaviors in the brightest regions, where deviations are primarily characterized by flattening of slope. No significant (3$\sigma$) correlations are found between global properties and the best-fit parameters. We discuss the comparison to previous studies and plausible physics behind the statistical results obtained in this work.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the extremely high-resolution ($m_{\rm bary}=4\rm{M}_\odot$) LYRA cosmological galaxy formation simulations of six dwarf galaxies with $M_{\rm 200c}\sim10^9\rm{M}_\odot$ at $z=0$ to investigate their stellar assembly histories. Based on the age of stars in these galaxies at $z=0$, $40-100\%$ of their stellar mass was formed by the time of reionization, when star formation (SF) abruptly shuts down. Depending on their halo mass evolution, some of the dwarfs reignite SF post-reionization (rejuvenators), while others remain quenched for the rest of cosmic time (reionization relics). However, the stellar mass of relics can still grow by more than $50\%$ through mergers post-reionisation. We find clear correlations between metallicity distributions of the galaxies and the fraction of stars formed post-reionization ($f_{\rm post-reio}^\star$) such that relics have lower median $\rm [Fe/H]$ with a more prominent low metallicity tail. Moreover, the shape of the galaxies at $z=0$ correlates with their $f_{\rm post-reio}^\star$, with rejuvenators showing more spherical stellar distribution than relics. This difference arises only post-reionization when rejuvenators become rounder with more SF activity. Similarly, the shape of dark matter (DM) halos in the inner regions display more spherical distributions in rejuvenators than in relics. The shape evolution shows that DM haloes in all galaxy formation simulations become rounder in comparison to their collision-less, DM-only counterparts. However, DM haloes of rejuvenators evolve more significantly. We do not find any correlation between SF activity and formation of shallow DM density cores in these galaxies. These predictions can be tested using upcoming observational data. In particular, our results indicate that the scatter in the mass-metallicity relation in the low mass regime is correlated with SF histories and the shape of galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Warm ionized gas is ubiquitous at the centers of X-ray bright elliptical galaxies. While it is believed to play a key role in the feeding and feedback processes of supermassive black holes, its origins remain under debate. Existing studies have primarily focused on the morphology and kinematics of warm ionized gas. This work aims to provide a new perspective on warm (10,000 K) ionized gas and its connection to X-ray-emitting hot gas (>10^6 K) by measuring and comparing their metallicities. We conducted a joint analysis of 13 massive elliptical galaxies using MUSE/VLT and Chandra observations. Emission-line ratios were measured for the warm ionized gas using MUSE observation, and used to infer the ionization mechanisms and derive metallicities of the warm ionized gas using HII, and LIN(E)R calibrations. We also computed the warm phase metallicity using X-ray/EUV, and pAGB stars models. For two sources at higher redshift, direct Te method was also used to measure warm gas metallicities. Our observations reveal that most sources exhibit composite ionization, with contributions from both star formation and LINER-like emission. A positive linear correlation was found between the gas-phase metallicities of the warm and hot phases, ranging from 0.3 to 1.5 Zsun, and suggest the intimate connection between the two gas phases, likely driven by gas cooling and/or mixing. In some sources the warm gas metallicity shows a central drop. A similar radial trend has been reported for the hot gas metallicity in some galaxy clusters. The ionization mechanisms of cooling flow elliptical galaxies are diverse, suggesting multiple channels for powering the warm ionized gas. The large variation in the warm gas metallicity further suggests that cold gas mass derived under the assumption of solar metallicity for the CO-to-H2 conversion factor needs to be revised by approximately an order of magnitude.

As a low-metallicity starburst, IC10's interstellar medium conditions could reflect small-scale physical conditions that mirror those of early galaxies, providing a unique window into the heating and cooling processes that shaped the interstellar medium in early-Universe environments. Leveraging the high angular (<5'' ~ 15pc) and spectral (0.4 km/s) resolution of the Local Group L-band Survey, we searched for HI absorption against nine continuum radio sources and detected absorption along three sightlines corresponding to internal radio emission sources within IC10. Using Gaussian decomposition and radiative transfer, we characterize the CNM, deriving spin temperatures of ~30-55 K, column densities of (0.6-3.0)x 1$0^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, cold HI fractions of ~ 21-37%, and line widths of ~ 5.6-13.6 km/s. For each individual detection of HI absorption, we find corresponding molecular emission from 12CO (J=1-0), HCO+ (J=1-0), and HCN (J=1-0) at similar velocities and with comparable linewidths, indicating a well-mixed atomic and molecular medium. In IC10, the CNM shows a clear kinematic connection to the high-density ISM, implying a stronger dynamical coupling with molecular gas than in the Milky Way, in line with expectations for low-metallicity environments. At the ~ 15 pc scales probed by slightly extended HII regions in IC10, unresolved CNM clouds likely contribute to line blending, so the observed broad HI linewidths may partly reflect spatial and kinematic averaging.
