 - **Abstract**
 Star-forming galaxies spend most of their lifetimes on the star-forming main sequence, which establishes a tight empirical and statistical relation between stellar mass and star-formation rate. Occasional episodes of rapid star formation can push them temporarily above this sequence, turning them into starbursts. Yet some galaxies display starburst-like traits -- rapid, dense, and compact star formation -- while still remaining within the scatter of the main sequence. These "starbursts in the main sequence" (SBMSs) reveal the complexity and diversity of star formation modes, making them crucial for understanding how galaxies evolve and transition between different regimes. In this paper, we identify SBMSs in the cosmological simulation NewHorizon and follow their evolution across time to uncover their physical origins and the role of this special regime in shaping galaxy evolution. We explain the existence of SBMSs by a comparatively earlier assembly of their stellar mass, driven in particular by more frequent and repeated mergers as the other galaxies, as well as exceptionally productive starburst events triggered by these interactions. As a result, this regime appears preferentially -- though not exclusively -- in the most massive galaxies. The SBMS behavior is not continuous within individual galaxies but instead arises intermittently as a short-lived (~ 30 Myr) evolutionary mode. Nevertheless, such SBMS episodes exist throughout cosmic time across the galaxy population... [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Spitzer and WISE images, we discovered 42 mid-IR luminous dusty supernovae with local integral-field spectroscopy data. The observed mid-IR emission indicates the presence of newly formed dust, or pre-existing dust heated by the radiation from the supernovae or circumstellar medium interactions. We carried out a systematic analysis of the supernova host environments and their dust properties, for understanding the dust-veiled exploding stars, and whether such an intense dust production process is associated with their local environments. We find that dusty supernovae prefer the locations with higher EW(H{\alpha}), lower metallicity, and heavier host extinctions compared to typical SN types, and they show the same increasing sequence in the values of EW(H{\alpha}) and oxygen abundance from hydrogen-rich, type IIn and hydrogen-poor dusty supernovae. These differences in environmental properties of different dusty SN types indicate the diversity of their progenitors. We also found that one marginal correlation is a negative correlation between the SN dust mass and star formation rate. This means that SNe would be more mid-IR luminous and more dust-rich at the region with lower star formation rate. However, the SN dust mass show no correlation with the metallicity and the host extinction, which were thought to be key factors affecting the mass-loss history of progenitors and the CSM environment of SNe. Therefore, the dust formation process in SNe might be insensitive to metallicity and the dust condition of their host environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophotonics will be central to astronomical instrumentation, enabling lightweight, compact, and environmentally stable systems for both ground-based observatories and space missions. One key application is beam combination for nulling integrated with a photonic lantern, and long baseline nulling interferometry, which suppresses starlight to reveal exoplanets and companions. Compact, broadband photonic beam combiners are essential for providing a pathway to complex circuitry on a single chip and scalable solutions for single and multi-telescope instruments, and are investigated herein. Two-waveguide photonic combiners rely on symmetric coupling to interfere light, which is chromatic and requires modification for broadband operation. A three-waveguide configuration (tri-coupler) offers the potential for deeper, broader, and stable achromatic nulls. This work compares simulations of two evanescent tri-couplers and a multimode interference coupler (MMI) across the 1.5 - 1.8 ${\mu}$m band, evaluating exoplanet throughput, starlight attenuation, sensing characteristics, and estimations on fabrication tolerance. The standard tri-coupler was outperformed by both a tapered tri-coupler and the MMI, each of which achieved exoplanet throughput >85% throughout the band. The standard design recorded a minimum exoplanet throughput of 50% at the waveband's extremes. The tapered tri-coupler was further redesigned to achieve a non-degenerate sensing state. The MMI, while limited to a starlight attenuation of 40 dB $\left(10^{-4}\right)$ by uncoupled light, showed the greatest tolerance to fabrication errors, offering strong practical potential. Future designs aim to combine high exoplanet throughput, deep starlight attenuation, and non-degenerate sensing within a single integrated architecture.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray timing of active galactic nuclei (AGN) provides a unique probe of gas accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), which trace gas dynamics in the strongly curved spacetime around SMBHs, are rare in AGN. These signals often are analogs of high-frequency QPOs occasionally seen in some black-hole X-ray binaries, and their scarcity in AGN can partly be attributed to the low frequencies expected for typical SMBH masses. Intriguingly, robust X-ray QPO detections in SMBH systems have so far been reported only in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) and tidal disruption events (TDEs). Here we report the discovery of a QPO candidate during the 2018 outburst of the changing-look AGN (CL-AGN) NGC 1566. Numerical simulations indicate that the disk epicyclic oscillations responsible for high-frequency QPOs are damped by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence unless the accretion flow is misaligned and/or eccentric. In TDEs, the stellar debris stream is naturally misaligned with the SMBH spin, while NLS1s may host misaligned disks due to their youth. Motivated by the QPO candidate in NGC 1566, we propose that CL-AGN accretion is also misaligned -- potentially fueled by captured, free-falling broad-line region clouds. This model naturally explains why CL-AGN transition timescales are much shorter than the standard disk viscous timescale. This picture can be tested by searching for QPOs or quasi-periodic eruptions in other CL-AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate spatially resolved dust corrections are critical for interpreting the structure and evolution of star-forming galaxies (SFGs). We present an empirical model for predicting spatially resolved dust attenuation ($A_V$) in SFGs using integral field spectroscopy from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey. Using a sample of 5,155 galaxies over $7.20<M_\ast<11.14$ and $0.0002 < z < 0.1444$, we derive $A_V$ maps from the Balmer decrement across more than 1,898,954 star-forming spaxels. Using local star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\text{SFR}}$) as a predictor, the model achieves $R^2 = 0.69$ and RMSE $=0.22$ mag, with residuals that are approximately Gaussian and centred near zero. It predicts $A_V$ within a factor of $\sim$1.3 on kpc scales. We also demonstrate that the relation can be applied iteratively to recover dust-corrected $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ from uncorrected values, converging by the fourth iteration with minimal residual bias ($-0.01$ mag) and low RMSE ($0.42$ mag). The model accurately reproduces $A_V$ maps across diverse morphologies and orientations, including edge-on systems. It also recovers the observed radial $A_V$ profiles, capturing their dependence on stellar mass and relative star formation activity, with more massive and more strongly star-forming galaxies showing steeper gradients.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's nuclear star cluster (NSC) is a unique laboratory to study the formation and evolution of dense stellar systems around a supermassive black hole. Previous work suggests that most stars in the NSC are old; however, the detailed age and metallicity distributions remain uncertain. We constrain the star formation history (SFH) and metallicity of a poorly explored region located $\sim$3 pc from SagittariusA*. We analyse VLT/NACO imaging in an intermediate-band filter centred at 2.24 $\mu$m, complemented by $H$-band data. We construct completeness-corrected $K$-band luminosity functions (LFs), clearly identifying the Red Clump and Red Giant Branch Bumps. The SFH is derived by fitting cumulative LFs with MIST, PARSEC, and BaSTI models spanning a wide range of ages and metallicities, using Monte Carlo sampling to estimate uncertainties. Metallicity constraints are refined using spectroscopic measurements from the literature. The stellar population is predominantly old and metal-rich: $75.6 \pm 9.5$% of the stellar mass formed $\gtrsim 10$ Gyr ago, with median [M/H] $\sim +0.35$. An intermediate-age component at 2-3 Gyr contributes $20.8 \pm 8.7$%, while minor populations are present at $\sim$400 Myr ($0.9 \pm 0.8$%) and 20 Myr ($3.6 \pm 1.4$%), the latter representing a small but non-negligible young population. Systematic uncertainties from stellar models, binning, photometric range, unresolved binaries, and filter choice are assessed. These results indicate early dominant formation, a significant 2-3 Gyr episode, and minor recent activity, consistent with spectroscopic measurements and with properties of the inner NSC and nuclear stellar disc.

 - **Abstract**
 The ionization mechanisms of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs), which are common in the local Universe, have been debated for decades. Our nearest large neighbor, M31, is classified as a LINER based on its optical emission line properties within the central kpc. In this work, we present a detailed photoionization modeling of the circumnuclear ionized gas in M31, explicitly tailored to its well-constrained physical conditions, including the absence of ongoing star formation and a currently inactive active galactic nucleus (AGN). Using spatially resolved CFHT/SITELLE observations, we find that photoionization by hot, evolved low-mass stars distributed throughout the bulge can roughly reproduce the observed radial intensity profiles of H{\alpha}, H\b{eta}, and [NII]. However, these models fail to match the observed [OIII] emission, producing radial profiles and [O III]/H\b{eta} ratios that are significantly steeper than observed. This discrepancy indicates a deficit of high-energy ionizing photons in standard stellar photoionization models, even with extended ionizing sources. We explore whether this tension can be alleviated by invoking either a bulge-filling, low-density ionized medium surrounding a denser H{\alpha}-emitting disk, or enhanced AGN activity in the recent past. While both scenarios can partially increase the [O III] emission, neither provides a fully satisfactory explanation under physically plausible conditions. Together with our earlier results for M81, these findings underscore persistent challenges in explaining LINER-like emission solely through conventional photoionization mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of the global solar magnetic field directly impacts the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). During the solar maximum of Cycle 24, the monthly averaged IMF strength doubled over five Carrington rotations in late 2014. To understand the physical origin of this increase, we investigate the temporal evolution of open magnetic flux resulting from the emergence and decay of bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs). Using surface flux transport and potential field source surface models, we simulated how BMR characteristics, spatial distributions, and interaction with background magnetic fields affect open flux evolution. Our simulation confirmed that the relative configuration of BMRs can either inhibit open flux expansion via closed loops or promote it through favorable connections. The increase in open flux is primarily driven by the equatorial dipole component, which is enhanced by differential rotation acting on tilted BMRs. These behaviors suggest that large open field structures develop from equatorial dipole components formed by these stretched BMRs. We attribute the rapid IMF increase in 2014 (Carrington rotations 2152-2157) to the combination of the following three factors: (1) a specific sunspot configuration that facilitated the expansion of the southern coronal hole; (2) the emergence of a giant sunspot group (active region 12192) with high magnetic intensity; and (3) the diffusion of these regions, which reinforced the global magnetic field. These results imply that rapid open flux variations during solar maximum are governed not only by the characteristics of emerging BMRs but also by their interaction with pre-existing large coronal holes.
#### A New Window into the Baryon Cycle at Cosmic Noon with Line Intensity Mapping: Forecasts for auto- and cross-correlations in [CII]-158$μ$m, HI 21 cm, CO$_{J+1\rightarrow J}$, and H$α$ galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Across the peak of cosmic star formation at $z\sim1-2$, inflow, processing, and feedback drive rapid changes in the spatial distribution and chemical composition of baryons in galaxies and surrounding reservoirs; this baryon cycle can be tomographically mapped by line intensity mapping (LIM) of atomic hydrogen, ionized carbon, and carbon monoxide. We present a simulation-based forecasting framework for detecting auto- and cross-power spectra between spectroscopic surveys of four such tracers at $z\sim0.5-1.7$ mapping the same deep field - TIM, EoRSpec/FYST, MeerKAT, & Euclid. We forward-model 3-D distributions for these tracers from magnetohydrodynamic simulations, directly capturing the two-halo, one-halo, and shot statistics without relying on analytical decompositions. We further detail a signal-to-noise formalism, tailored to LIM surveys with highly anisotropic geometries and Fourier-space coverage. We demonstrate that galaxy cross-correlations will be the dominant discovery channel for current-generation surveys. These instruments will detect the auto-spectra for CO and HI 21 cm and the CO $\times$ 21 cm cross-spectrum at modest S/N $\sim 1-10$, while placing upper limits on the [CII]-158$\mu$m signals. [CII], CO, and HI LIM will be $\sim3-30\times$ ($0.5-1.5$ dex) more sensitive to cross-correlation with the Euclid survey, however, than their respective auto-correlations, constraining all three models of line emission at high significance (S/N $\sim 10-40$) within this decade. Finally, we formulate a staged instrumental trajectory with planned or reasonable improvements, including the as-proposed SKA-Mid. We forecast advancing the per-$k$-mode sensitivities of each auto-, galaxy-line, and line-line spectrum by several orders of magnitude, enabling new percent- and sub-percent level constraints on cosmology and the redshift evolution of star formation and the baryon cycle.
#### Filling the Gap in Cluster Evolution: JWST's Glimpse into a Young, Star-Forming Cluster at Cosmic Noon

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed study of HUDFJ0332.4-2746.6 (HUDF46), a $z \approx 1.84$ overdensity in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, previously identified with HST as a proto-cluster. JWST/NIRISS spectroscopy expands its confirmed membership from 18 to 37 galaxies, while deep HST/ACS, JWST/NIRCam, and JWST/MIRI imaging provide a comprehensive multiwavelength view from the rest-frame UV to the mid-infrared. This dataset probes the population across three dex in stellar mass ($M_\bigstar \approx 10^{7.5\text{--}10.5}\,M_\odot$), delivering the first direct view of a young cluster down to such low-$M_\bigstar$ at $z\gtrsim1$. Assuming virialization, we derive a velocity dispersion of $\sigma \approx 670\pm 91\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and a halo mass of $M_{200} \approx (1.2\pm0.2) \times 10^{14}\,M_\odot$, in agreement with X-ray constraints from deep {\it Chandra} data. Despite residing in a massive halo likely in the hot-halo regime, the population is overwhelmingly star-forming, with no established red sequence and no extended X-ray emission from a hot intracluster medium. HUDF46 members have stellar and structural properties nearly indistinguishable from coeval field galaxies, and the structure hosts only one AGN candidate, found in its brightest galaxy, which lies at the cluster center. Overall, HUDF46 appears to be in a transitional phase prior to the onset of environmental quenching, making its galaxy population a key benchmark for tracing the processes that will later build a passive population and shape the assembly of massive clusters at later cosmic times.

 - **Abstract**
 Being the most massive known young stellar cluster in the Milky Way, Westerlund 1 (Wd1) constitutes an ideal benchmark for understanding the evolution of massive stars. However, the cluster age remains highly controversial (~4-10 Myr), hindering the use of Wd1 as a reference for massive star evolution. One of the main issues is high foreground extinction, which has so far prevented the detection of the main sequence. Using infrared spectroscopy we seek to detect the cluster's main sequence for the first time, to characterise the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and to use the cluster's turn-off to obtain a robust age estimate. We obtained multi-epoch, near-infrared VLT/KMOS spectroscopic observations of Wd1 to map its population of massive stars. The spectra of ~110 members were analysed with CMFGEN models to derive stellar parameters, populate the cluster Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and compare it with isochrones from evolutionary models. Our observations returned 47 new spectroscopically identified cluster members, with spectral types O9-B1 III-V. The cluster turn-off indicates an age of 5.5+/-1.0 Myr at a distance of 4.23+0.23-0.21 kpc, displaying a moderate degree of coevality. We demonstrate that our estimate of the age of Wd1 is robust against reasonable changes in the distance and extinction law, and the adopted rotational velocity and metallicity of the stellar isochrones. We further find that ~65% of the OB stars with multi-epoch coverage exhibit radial-velocity variability. Infrared observations of the unevolved stellar population support a single episode of star formation with an age of ~5.5 Myr, reinforcing its potential as a benchmark for massive star evolution and providing a reference sample for future binary population studies.
