 - **Abstract**
 We characterize the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) pulsar SXP 46.6 using NuSTAR observations conducted in 2017. The spin period (P) of this neutron star decreased from its discovered value of 46.6 s to a value of 45.984(1) s, indicating a spin-up at the rate of \dot{P} = -1.13 x 10^{-9} s s^{-1}. This spin-up rate is used to calculate a high pulsar magnetic field value of 2.25 x 10^{13} G. This process also gives a low magnetic field value, which we rule out here by constraining the inner accretion disk radius to be less than the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit. The pulse profile, analyzed in soft, hard, and broad X-ray bands, shows a double-peaked structure, consistent with pencil beam emission from two antipodal hot spots on the neutron star surface. We also perform spin phase-resolved spectroscopy for the first time, revealing spectral variations across different phases of the pulsar's rotation. These results offer new insights into the long-term spin evolution and emission properties of SXP 46.6.

 - **Abstract**
 Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies are a type of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that were originally classified as sources with little to no radio emission. Although the class is rather unified from an optical perspective, their radio characteristics are diverse. One of the biggest curiosities found in these sources is their ability to form and maintain powerful relativistic jets. We studied the radio properties of a sample of 3998 NLS1 galaxies which is the largest clean sample available, thus allowing us to study the population-wide characteristics. We used both historical and ongoing surveys: the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS; 144~MHz), the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST; 1.4~GHz), the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS; 1.4~GHz), and the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS; 3~GHz). We were able to obtain a radio detection for $\sim40\%$ of our sources, with the most detections by LoTSS. The majority of the detected NLS1 galaxies are faint ($\sim1-2$ mJy) and non-variable, suggesting considerable contributions from star formation activities, especially at 144~MHz. However, we identified samples of extreme sources, for example, in fractional variability and radio luminosity, indicating significant AGN activity. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the NLS1 galaxy population in radio and lays the foundation for targeted future studies.
#### Neutral hydrogen in and around galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization

 - **Abstract**
 JWST spectra revealing Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) absorption in $z\sim 5-14$ galaxies offer a unique probe of reionization's earliest stages. However, disentangling absorption by the increasingly neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) from that in galaxies' interstellar and circumgalactic medium (ISM, CGM) remains challenging due to the poorly constrained nature of neutral hydrogen (HI) in and around galaxies at these redshifts. We use the SERRA high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations to characterize the HI distribution and its evolution along sightlines to star-forming regions during reionization, to interpret the contribution of local HI (ISM+CGM) to Ly$\alpha$ absorption in $z>5$ spectra. We analyze $\sim 100$ $z=6-9.5$ galaxies, generating mock sightlines from each galaxy's star formation peak. We study the sightline distribution of HI column densities ($N_{\rm HI}$) and its variation with radius, halo mass and redshift. We find broad sightline variation in $N_{\rm HI}$ (0.5-1.5dex) due to complex ISM morphology driven by bursty star formation, with median $\log(N_{\rm HI}/{\rm cm}^{-2}) \simeq 21-22$. Dense ISM gas is the dominant origin of damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption (DLA) systems along sightlines towards star-forming regions, outweighing gas in the CGM, filaments and proximate absorbers. Median $N_{\rm HI}$ increases with halo mass, scaling roughly with the virial radius, as expected due to larger potentials and more extended CGM, but shows negligible redshift evolution at fixed halo mass. This suggests post-reionization $N_{\rm HI}$ distributions may provide useful priors to interpret IGM damping wings at higher redshifts. To interpret strong $z>5$ DLA candidates found by JWST, we investigate $N_{\rm HI}>10^{22}{\rm cm}^{-2}$ sightlines. These trace dense, metal-enriched ISM within <1 kpc of massive halos, a scenario testable with higher-resolution spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 From the luminous quasars at $z \sim 6$ to the recent $z \sim 9-11$ AGNs revealed by JWST, observations of the earliest black hole (BH) populations can provide unique constraints on BH formation and growth models. We use the BRAHMA simulations with constrained initial conditions to investigate BH assembly in extreme overdense regions. The simulations implement heavy seeds ($\sim 10^4-10^5 M_{\odot})$ forming in dense, metal-poor gas exposed to sufficient Lyman-Werner flux. With gas accretion modeled via Bondi-Hoyle formalism and BH dynamics and mergers using a subgrid dynamical friction scheme, we isolate the impact of seeding, dynamics, accretion, and feedback on early BH growth. With fiducial stellar and AGN feedback inherited from IllustrisTNG, accretion is strongly suppressed at $z \gtrsim 9$, leaving mergers as the dominant growth channel. Gas accretion dominates at $z \lesssim 9$, where permissive models (super-Eddington or low radiative efficiency) build $\sim 10^9\ M_{\odot}$ BHs powering quasars by $z \sim 6$, while stricter IllustrisTNG-based prescriptions yield much lower BH masses ($\sim 10^6-10^8\ M_{\odot}$). Our seed models strongly affect merger-driven growth at $z \gtrsim 9$: only the most lenient models (with $\sim 10^5\ M_{\odot}$ seeds) produce enough BH mergers to reach $\gtrsim 10^6\ M_{\odot}$ by $z \sim 10$, consistent with current estimates for GN-z11. Our dynamical friction model gives low merger efficiencies, hindering the buildup of $\gtrsim 10^7\ M_{\odot}$ BHs by $z \sim 9-10$, as currently inferred for GHZ9, UHZ1, and CAPERS-LRD-z9. If the BH-to-stellar mass ratios of these sources are indeed as extreme as currently inferred, they would require either very short BH merger timescales or reduced AGN thermal feedback. Weaker stellar feedback boosts both star formation and BH accretion and cannot raise these ratios.
#### Discovery of diffuse gamma-ray emission in the vicinity of G172.8+1.5: An old supernova remnant with different turbulence properties

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission in the vicinity of G172.8+1.5, which is debated as a Supernova remnant (SNR) or an ionized hydrogen (H$_{\rm{II}}$) region. Using 16-yr Pass 8 data from Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we found the GeV emission can be described by two extended sources with different photon spectra. Among them, the much more extended $\gamma$-ray source SrcA with a Power-law spectrum is spatially coincident with a giant neutral Hydrogen shell structure and several OB stars inside a huge H$_{\rm{II}}$ region. The softer Log-Parabola spectra $\gamma$-ray source SrcB is spatially coincident with a star-forming region with several OB stars, maser sources and IR sources. Gas observation results display a dense molecular cloud surrounding SrcB in the velocity range of [-25,-5] km s$^{-1}$. The possible origins of $\gamma$-ray emission are discussed, including CRs escaped from SNR shock surface and illuminated nearby MC, the young massive star clusters associated with the star-forming region and a pulsar halo generated by an invisible energetic pulsar inside the SNR. Furthermore, under the hadronic scenario, the measured diffusion coefficient in the compact SrcB region is significantly lower than that of the more extended SrcA. This suppression is likely attributed to cosmic-ray-driven instabilities, which reduce the diffusion efficiency in the vicinity of the source relative to the standard conditions in the interstellar medium (ISM). Future advanced analysis from LHAASO observation results would help distinguish the origins of $\gamma$-ray emission in this region and clarify the nature of this source.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) imaging of a MHz-peaked spectrum (MPS) source that was found using commensal low-frequency data taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The source, J0330-2730, was identified in multi-epoch data from the VLA Low-band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (VLITE). VLITE continuously collects low-frequency data at 340 MHz during regular VLA observations. Our analysis of the VLITE light curve demonstrates that J0330-2730 has significant 340 MHz flux variability at the ~20% level over a timescale of approximately one year. Our VLBA images reveal a resolved, double-lobed morphology with a projected linear size of 64 pc. We consider plausible mechanisms that could explain the observed 340 MHz variability and the source properties on milliarcsecond scales. We rule-out variable Doppler boosting and conclude that refractive interstellar scintillation or variable free-free absorption are the most likely explanations. We argue that the properties of J0330-2730 are consistent with the class of compact symmetric objects (CSOs) and consider the evolutionary stage of the source. The extent of the resolved lobes revealed by the VLBA is significantly smaller than predictions based on the turnover-size relation for a standard synchrotron self-absorbed jet model. We discuss possible explanations for the departure from the turnover-size relation, including jet formation by a transient phenomenon such as a tidal disruption event or a "frustrated jet" impeded by the presence of dense gas or a high-pressure environment. This study highlights the potential of VLITE for the identification of compact and young radio sources.
#### Ly-alpha emission reveals two satellite halos around massive groups at z ~ 3: the puzzling case of a quiescent central galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery and characterisation of two Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (LANs), RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat, as satellite structures of two giant LANs at $z=2.920$ and 3.092. They are found neighbouring two out of four known giant LANs at $z\sim3$ in our MUSE follow-up observations, reinforcing the idea that Ly$\alpha$ emission can be used to trace massive dark matter halos at high-$z$. This high occurrence of massive satellite halos agrees with simulations. With sizes of $\simeq80\times160$ and $80\times100~\mathrm{pkpc}^2$, the two nebulae are both $\sim$300pkpc from the main LANs. The Ly$\alpha$ emission is only shifted by $\simeq100-300$ km s$^{-1}$ between each of the two pairs, suggesting connections via large-scale structure. RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat are estimated to have log$(M_\mathrm{h}/M_\odot)\simeq13.2\pm0.3$ and $12.8\pm0.3$, putting them potentially close to the regime of cold-mode accretion. The central brightest galaxies in the two halos are morphologically distinct despite having similar stellar mass $\sim10^{11}M_\odot$, one being an elliptical quiescent galaxy in RO-1001-Sat and the other being a dusty star-forming spiral in RO-0959-Sat. Intriguingly, the quiescent galaxy aligns well with the peak of the LAN as well as the potential well of the host halo, making it the first clear-cut case where the cold gas ought to be accreting onto the galaxy but with no observable star formation, either due to morphological quenching or, more likely, radio-mode feedback from an active galactic nucleus. Finally, we show a tentative detection of a Ly$\alpha$ filament connecting RO-1001 and RO-1001-Sat. This work shows how panoramic MUSE (and in the future, BlueMUSE) observations of massive halo seeds can be used to efficiently search for additional halos, unveiling their large-scale structure and enabling the study of Ly$\alpha$-selected galaxy groups.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by recent detections of low-mass perturbers in strong gravitational lensing systems, we investigate analogs of these objects in the Concerto suite, a set of cosmological N-body zoom-in simulations of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with high-amplitude, velocity-dependent cross sections. We investigate characteristic halo properties relevant to gravitational imaging measurements, focusing on the projected enclosed mass and the central density slope. In SIDM, these quantities evolve continuously through gravothermal processes, spanning core-expansion and core-collapse phases, in sharp contrast to cold dark matter, where they remain nearly static after halo formation. This SIDM evolution further depends on tidal environment and merger history, which can be probed through strong lensing. We also identify simulated SIDM halos whose properties are consistent with the properties of low-mass perturbers inferred from recent observations, and we demonstrate that the core-collapse mechanism offers a compelling explanation for their observed high densities. Our results highlight the potential of strong gravitational lensing as a powerful probe of dark matter self-interactions.
#### Orbital Period Changes in Recurrent Nova T Corona Borealis Prove That It Is Not a Type Ia Supernovae Progenitor

 - **Abstract**
 T Corona Borealis (T CrB) is a recurrent nova and a symbiotic star that is commonly highlighted as the best case for being a progenitor of a Type Ia supernova (SNIa) within the framework of single-degenerate models. This exemplar can be tested by measuring whether the white dwarf (WD) mass ($M_{\rm WD}$) is increasing over each eruption cycle. This is a balance between the mass ejected during each nova event ($M_{\rm ejecta}$) and the mass accreted onto the WD between the nova events ($M_{\rm accreted}$). I have used all 206 radial velocities from 1946--2024 to measure the orbital period just after the 1946 eruption to be $P_{\rm post}$=227.6043 days, while the steady orbital period change ($\dot{P}$) is ($-$3.1$\pm$1.6)$\times$10$^{-6}$. I have used my full 213,730 magnitude $B$ and $V$ light curve from 1842--2025 to measure the times of maximum brightness in the ellipsoidal modulations to construct the $O-C$ from 1866--1946. I fit the broken parabola shape, to find the orbital period immediately before the 1946 eruption to be $P_{\rm pre}$=227.4586 days. The orbital period changed by $\Delta P$=$+$0.146$\pm$0.019 days. With Kepler's Law, conservation of angular momentum, and the well-measured binary properties, the ejecta mass in 1946 is 0.00074$\pm$0.00009 M$_{\odot}$. $M_{\rm accreted}$ is reliably measured to be 1.38$\times$10$^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$ from the accretion luminosity. $M_{\rm ejecta}$ is larger than $M_{\rm accreted}$ by 540$\times$, so $M_{\rm WD}$ is {\it decreasing} every eruption cycle. T CrB can never become a SNIa.

 - **Abstract**
 Oscillons are long-lived nonlinear pseudo-solitonic configurations of scalar fields and many plausible inflationary scenarios predict an oscillon-dominated phase in the early universe. Many possible aspects of this phase remain unexplored, particularly oscillon-oscillon interactions and interactions between oscillons and their environment. However the primary long range forces between oscillons are gravitational and thus slow-acting relative to the intrinsic timescales of the oscillons themselves. Given that simulations with local gravity are computationally expensive we explore these effects by extracting individual specimens from simulations and then engineering interactions. We find that oscillons experience friction when moving in an inhomogeneous background and, because oscillons in non-relativistic collisions bounce or merge as a function of their relative phases, the outcomes of interactions between ``wild'' oscillons depend on their specific trajectories.
#### Identifying tidal disruption events among radio transient galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present the optical and infrared properties of a sample of 24 radio transient sources discovered in the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). Previous studies of their radio emission showed that these sources resemble young gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) radio sources, but are less powerful and characterized by low-power jets. The bursts of radio activity in most cases are likely due to intrinsic changes in the accretion processes. However, for a few sources in this sample, we cannot rule out the possibility that their radio variability results from a tidal disruption event (TDE). In this work, we extend our analysis to the optical and infrared regimes, confirming that our sample of radio transients is not homogeneous in terms of their optical and infrared properties either. The host galaxies of most of these sources are massive ellipticals with emission dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses typical of radio-loud AGNs ($\rm >10^7\,M_{\odot}$), but exhibit very low accretion activity. In contrast, the sources for which a TDE origin is suspected are either pure star-forming galaxies or show significant ongoing star formation, similar to radio-selected optically-detected TDEs. Additionally, two of them exhibit infrared flares characteristic of TDEs, while the remaining sources do not display significant variability outside the radio regime. Moreover, the evolution of their radio brightness in the W3/radio diagnostic diagram, which we employ in our analysis, also sets our TDE candidates apart from the rest of the sample and resembles the radio variability seen in optically discovered TDEs with radio emission. Finally, based on our findings, we hypothesize that the mid-IR/radio relation can serve as a tool to distinguish between radio transients caused by TDEs and those originating from intrinsic AGN variability.
#### Impact Plasma Amplification of the Ancient Mercury Magnetic Field

 - **Abstract**
 Spacecraft measurements of Mercury indicate it has a core dynamo with a surface field of 200-800 nT. These data also indicate that the crust contains remanent magnetization likely produced by an ancient magnetic field. The inferred magnetization intensity is consistent with a wide range of paleofield strengths (0.2-50 uT), possibly indicating that Mercury once had a dynamo field much stronger than today. Recent modeling of ancient lunar impacts has demonstrated that plasma generated during basin-formation can transiently amplify a planetary dynamo field near the surface. Simultaneous impact-induced pressure waves can then record these fields in the form of crustal shock remanent magnetization (SRM). Here, we present impact hydrocode and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a Caloris-size basin (~1,550 km diameter) formation event. Our results demonstrate that the ancient magnetospheric field (~0.5-0.9 uT) created by the interaction of the ancient interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and Mercury's dynamo field can be amplified by the plasma up to ~13 uT and, via impact pressure waves, be recorded as SRM in the basin antipode. Such magnetization could produce ~5 nT crustal fields at 20-km altitude antipodal to Caloris detectable by future spacecraft like BepiColombo. Furthermore, impacts in the southern hemisphere that formed ~1,000 km diameter basins (e.g., Andal-Coleridge, Matisse-Repin, Eitkou-Milton, and Sadi-Scopus) could impart crustal magnetization in the northern hemisphere, contributing to the overall remanent field measured by MESSENGER. Overall, the impact plasma amplification process can contribute to crustal magnetization on airless bodies and should be considered when reconstructing dynamo history from crustal anomaly measurements.
#### RAD@home discovery of extragalactic radio rings and odd radio circles: clues to their origins

 - **Abstract**
 We present three rare and striking extragalactic radio sources discovered through visual inspection of low-frequency continuum maps from LoTSS DR2 and TGSS by the RAD@home citizen-science collaboratory. The first, RAD J131346.9+500320, is the first clear Odd Radio Circle (ORC) identified in LoTSS. At photometric $z \sim$ 0.94, it hosts a pair of intersecting rings of ~300 kpc diameter, embedded in diffuse emission extending over ~800 kpc, making it both the most distant and most powerful ORC reported to date. Its steep spectrum $\alpha_{54}^{144}=1.22\pm0.15$) points to a relic synchrotron origin. The second object, RAD J122622.6+640622, is a ~865 kpc giant radio galaxy whose southern jet is abruptly deflected, inflating a ~100 kpc limb-brightened ring, while the northern jet terminates in a compact hotspot-like feature. The third, RAD J142004.0+621715 (~440 kpc), shows a comparable ring at the end of its northern filamentary jet, along with a secondary filament parallel to its southern jet. All three systems lie in $\sim10^{14}M_\odot$ clusters or group-scale haloes, suggesting that environmental density gradients and possible jet-galaxy interactions play a central role in shaping these ring morphologies. These discoveries expand the zoo of extragalactic radio morphologies, highlight the diversity of pathways that can generate ring-like synchrotron structures, and demonstrate the continuing importance of human pattern recognition in identifying rare sources that escape current automated pipelines.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs are essential probes of stellar and planetary formation, yet their low luminosities pose challenges for detection at large Galactic distances. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its unprecedented near-infrared sensitivity, enables the discovery and characterization of distant substellar objects, including those in the Milky Way's thick disk and halo. We conducted a systematic search using over 40,000 publicly available JWST/NIRSpec PRISM/CLEAR spectra and identified 68 brown dwarfs through spectral template matching and visual inspection. Among them, 12 are newly identified candidates, including 8 T dwarfs and 4 M/L dwarfs, most at distances exceeding 1 kpc. Remarkably, two sources -- JWST J001418.22-302223.2 and JWST J033240.07-274907.8 -- are found at distances greater than 5 kpc, making them the most distant brown dwarfs within the Milky Way. Spectral fits were performed using a nested sampling Monte Carlo algorithm with three model grids: Sonora Elf Owl, LOWZ, and SAND. The analysis reveals that cloud-free models are unable to reproduce L/T transition spectra, whereas the SAND model provides a more accurate representation of cloud effects in metal-poor environments. With the newly identified distant brown dwarfs, we also investigated the vertical metallicity gradient of brown dwarfs. Overall, the metallicities do not show an evident trend with Galactic height $|Z|$, due to the limited sample size and the uncertainties in metallicity measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 High resolution, ultraviolet imaging is often unavailable across the sky, even in heavily studied fields such as the Chandra Deep Field - South. The Habitable Worlds Observatory is one of two upcoming missions with the possibility of significant UV capabilities, and the only one early enough in development to consider suggestions to its design. In this paper, we conduct an initial study of how current common UV filter sets affect the results of spectral energy distribution fitting for the estimation of galaxy parameter. This initial look is intended to motivate the need for future, more robust, SED fitting of mock galaxies. We compare the broad near UV and far UV filters used by the GALEX mission to the three more narrow Swift UVOT filters. We find that the GALEX filters result in larger errors when calculating the UV beta parameter compared to UVOT, and provide little constraint on the star formation age of a galaxy. We further note the ability of the UVOT filters to investigate the 2175Å attenuation bump; GALEX has a reduced capacity to trace this same feature. Ultimately, we recommend that in order to optimize the effectiveness of HWO's ultraviolet capacity for transformative astrophysics, a minimum of a FUV filter with three medium band NUV filters should be adopted. This will combine the power of GALEX's wavelength range with the finer sampling of UVOT around an important dust feature.

 - **Abstract**
 What triggers AGN in some galaxies and what role does this brief period of activity play in the overall evolution of galaxies are still open questions. This paper explores whether or not the local, on scales of $\approx$1\,Mpc, galaxy density plays a role in triggering AGN when controlling for stellar mass. We consider this question as a function of redshift and AGN selection in the X-ray vs. in the IR. We use available density maps within the 4.8\,this http URL. XMM-LSS field in the redshift range $0.1 < z < 1.6$. Our key result is that the environment may play a role in triggering IR AGN. In particular, at $z > 1.2$ the incidence of AGN increases in higher density environments, controlling for stellar mass. However, this dependence reverses at $z < 1.2$ where the incidence of IR AGN is higher in lower density environments. By contrast, among X-ray selected AGN there is no significant local density dependence. Bootstraping analysis confirms these conclusions. While these results agree with previous work on both obscured and unobscured AGN this is the first study to use a consistent methodology across IR and X-ray samples, as well as study IR dependence in this full redshift range. Upcoming large spectroscopic surveys such as the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) galaxy evolution survey will be critical in further elucidating how the environment affects AGN triggering across different cosmic epochs.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the one-dimensional stellar evolution code MESA, we find that all our models in the initial mass range of 12-40 Mo, regardless of whether they have hydrogen-rich, hydrogen-stripped, or helium+hydrogen-stripped envelopes, have at least one significant strong convective zone in the inner core, which can facilitate the jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We focus on stripped-envelope CCSN progenitors that earlier studies of the JJEM did not study, and examine the angular momentum parameter j=rVconv, where r is the radius of the layer and Vconv is the convective velocity according to the mixing length theory. In all models, there is at least one prominent convective zone with j>2e15 cm^2/s inside the mass coordinate that is the maximum baryonic mass of a neutron star (NS), m=2.65 Mo. According to the JJEM, convection in these zones seeds instabilities above the newly born NS, leading to the formation of intermittent accretion disks that launch pairs of jittering jets, which in turn explode the star. Our finding is encouraging for the JJEM, although it does not show that the intermittent accretion disks indeed form. We strengthen the claim that, according to the JJEM, there are no failed CCSNe and that all massive stars explode. In demonstrating the robust convection in the inner core of stripped-envelope CCSN progenitors, we add to the establishment of the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a timing study of the three known central compact object (CCO) pulsars, isolated cooling neutron stars in supernova remnants, using Chandra, XMM-Newton and NICER observations spanning two decades. Relative to canonical young pulsars, CCOs are spinning down at a very slow rate $|\dot f| <10^{-15}$ s$^{-2}$, implying a surface dipole magnetic field strength $B_s < 10^{11}$ G that is too weak to account for their X-ray emitting hot spots. Two CCO pulsars with sufficiently long monitoring, 1E 1207.4$-$5209 and PSR J0821$-$4300, are seen to deviate from steady spin-down; their timing residuals can be modeled by one or more glitches in $f$ and $\dot f$, or alternatively by extreme timing noise. For the third CCO pulsar, PSR J1852+0400, the sparse temporal coverage was insufficient to detect such effects. Glitch activity and timing noise in large samples of rotation-powered pulsars correlate best with $\dot f$, while the timing irregularities of the first two CCOs are extreme compared to pulsars of the same $\dot f$. Nevertheless, timing activity in CCOs may arise from properties that they share with other young but more energetic pulsars: high internal temperature, strong buried magnetic field and superfluid behavior. Alternatively, continuing low-level accretion of supernova debris is not ruled out as a source of timing noise in CCOs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's inner region is dominated by a stellar bar and a boxy-peanut shaped bulge. However, which stellar populations inhabit the inner Galaxy or how star formation proceeded there is still unknown. The difficulty in studying these stars stems from their location in dense regions that are strongly impacted by extinction and crowding effects. In this work, we use star formation histories computed in the solar neighbourhood using Gaia Colour-Magnitude Diagram fitting to shed light onto the evolution of the central regions of our Galaxy. For that, we have obtained precise age distributions for the non-negligible amount of super metal-rich stars ([M/H] $\sim$ 0.5) in the solar neighbourhood (more than 5$\%$ of the total stars within 400 pc of the plane). Assuming that these stars were born in the inner Galaxy and migrated outwards, those distributions should be indicative of the true stellar age distribution in the inner Galaxy. Surprisingly, we find that these age distributions are not continuous but show clear signs of episodic star formation ($\sim$~13.5, 10.0, 7.0, 4.0, 2.0 and less than 1~Gyr ago). Interestingly, with the exception of the 4~Gyr event, the timings of the detected events coincide with the formation of the primitive Milky Way and with known merging events or satellite encounters (Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage, Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and the Magellanic Clouds), suggesting that these could have induced enhanced and global star-forming episodes. These results are compatible with a scenario in which Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage is responsible for the formation of the bar 10 Gyr ago. However, we cannot associate any accretion counterpart with the 4-Gyr-ago event, leaving room for a late formation of the bar, as previously proposed. A qualitative comparison with the Auriga Superstars simulations suggesting a possible link to bar dynamics and satellite accretion. [Abridged]
#### Rotation Periods for Stars in Open Cluster NGC 6819 From Kepler IRIS Light Curves

 - **Abstract**
 We present an updated catalog of stellar rotation periods for the 2.5 Gyr open cluster NGC 6819 using the Kepler IRIS light curves from superstamp data. Our analysis uses Gaussian Process modeling to extract robust rotation signals from image subtraction light curves, allowing us unprecedented data access and measurement precision in the crowded cluster field. After applying stringent quality and contamination cuts, we identify 271 reliable rotation periods, representing by far the largest sample of rotators measured in a single intermediate-age cluster. Compared to previous work, which relied on only ~30 stars, our catalog extends the gyrochronological sequence of NGC 6819 with an order of magnitude more measurements and improved precision. The expanded dataset reveals both the expected temperature-dependent spin-down trend and substantial scatter at fixed effective temperature, including a bimodal distribution of fast and slow rotators. We also identify a distinct ``pile-up'' sequence consistent with predictions of weakened magnetic braking at critical Rossby numbers. These results strengthen this cluster's role as a benchmark for stellar spin evolution, while also highlighting the limitations of traditional gyrochronology at older ages. The final catalog and the model implementations are all available on Zenodo.
