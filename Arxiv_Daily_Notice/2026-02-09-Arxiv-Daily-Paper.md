 - **Abstract**
 In the framework of Milgromian dynamics (MOND), galaxy clusters are known to exhibit a residual missing mass problem, with the baryonic mass falling short of the dynamical mass by about a factor of two. The baryon content of clusters is dominated by the intracluster medium (ICM), while the stellar contribution depends sensitively on the assumed stellar initial mass function (IMF). We re-evaluate the stellar and remnant masses in galaxy clusters by adopting the integrated galaxy-wide initial mass function (IGIMF) theory, which accounts for the dependence of the IMF on galaxy properties and star formation histories. Massive elliptical galaxies, characterized by high metallicities and short formation timescales, are inferred to form with top-heavy IMFs, leading to a substantial population of stellar remnants. Using observational data from WINGS and 2MASS for 46 nearby (z < 0.1) galaxy clusters, we compute stellar, remnant, and intracluster light masses and combine them with previously derived ICM masses. The resulting total baryonic masses are compared to MOND dynamical masses inferred from hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that the baryonic mass in stars, remnants and the ICM accounts for at least $88^{+5+2}_{-4-1}\%$ of the MOND dynamical mass. This constrains the kick velocities of the remnants and substantially alleviates the missing mass problem for galaxy clusters in MOND.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations indicate that the disc population in galaxy clusters has undergone rapid evolution, transitioning from a dominance of blue spirals to red S0s over the past $\sim7$ Gyr. We build a simplified cluster evolutionary model in the $\Lambda$CDM framework to constrain the characteristic timescales of this transformation. In our model, field spirals joining the cluster are subject to ram-pressure stripping (RPS), which removes their gas reservoir leading to the quenching of their star formation on a timescale $t_{\rm s}$, and to an (initially) unspecified mechanism that transforms them into S0s on a timescale $t_{\rm m}$. We assume that $t_{\rm s}$ and $t_{\rm m}$ are independent and both power-law functions of $M_\star/M_{\rm cl}$, the galaxy-to-cluster mass ratio. We constrain our model using the observed distribution of spirals and S0s in a color-mass plane from the OmegaWINGS and EDisCS cluster surveys at $z\simeq0.055$ and $z\simeq0.7$. Our best-fit model reproduces the data remarkably well and predicts evolutionary trends for the main morphological fractions in agreement with previous studies. We find typical $t_{\rm s}$ between $0.1$ and $1$ Gyr, compatible with previous estimates. A surprisingly strong anti-correlation between $t_{\rm s}$ and $M_\star/M_{\rm cl}$ is required in order to suppress the formation of red, low-mass spirals at low redshift, which we interpret as driven by orbit anisotropy. Conversely, $t_{\rm m}$ depends very weakly on $M_\star/M_{\rm cl}$ and has typical values of a few Gyr. The inferred morphological evolution is compatible with that resulting from the ageing of the stellar populations in galaxies abruptly quenched by ram pressure stripping: we confirm spectrophotometric ageing as a key channel for the spiral-to-S0 transition in galaxy clusters, with secular evolution playing a secondary role.
#### Searching for dark matter signals with high energy astrophysical neutrinos in IceCube

 - **Abstract**
 High-energy neutrinos provide a potentially powerful and distinctive probe for dark matter (DM) - neutrino interactions, particularly in environments with enhanced DM densities, such as the DM spikes predicted to form around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Recent observations by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, which identified four AGN, namely TXS 0506+056, NGC 1068, PKS 1424+240, and NGC 4151 as neutrino sources, provide a unique opportunity to search for signatures of these interactions. In this study, we use IceCube data to derive the most stringent constraints to date on both the energy-dependent and energy-independent DM-neutrino scattering cross-sections. We perform a statistical analysis using data from individual sources as well as a combined (stacked) analysis of all four sources. Our strongest limits arise from the stacking analysis, yielding an upper bound of $\sigma_{0} \le 8\times 10^{-39}$ cm$^2$ for an energy-independent cross-section and $\sigma_{0} \le 10^{-39}$ cm$^2$ for a linearly energy-dependent cross-section, both at 90\% confidence level, particularly in scenarios involving the adiabatic growth of black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar high-energy radiation is a key driver of atmospheric erosion and evolution in exoplanets, directly affecting their long-term habitability. We present a comprehensive study on stellar high-energy radiation and its impact on exoplanetary atmospheres, leveraging data from the \textit{SRG/eROSITA} all-sky survey. Our sample consists of 3750 main-sequence stars identified by cross-matching with \textit{Gaia} DR3. Utilizing X-ray spectral fits from the \textit{eROSITA} catalog, we computed X-ray ($L_X$) and combined extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) luminosities ($L_{\mathrm{EUV}}$), which we used to derive XUV fluxes at the habitable zone ($F_{\mathrm{XUV,HZ}}$). We find that the majority of stars in our sample are significantly more XUV-active than the Sun, with habitable zone fluxes ranging from $10^0$ to $10^5$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The ratio of $L_{\mathrm{XUV}}/L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ is found to be higher for cooler, magnetically active stars, highlighting their potentially hazardous nature for planetary atmospheres. Applying the energy-limited escape model, we computed atmospheric mass-loss rates for hypothetical earth-like planets located at the habitable zone of each star. We also present local maps for distances up to $500$~pc of the average XUV flux, revealing ``hazard zones'' where stellar radiation could significantly influence planetary atmospheric evolution. This work demonstrates the power of X-ray surveys in constraining the high-energy environments of exoplanets and underscores the critical role of stellar activity in planetary habitability.
#### On the radial velocity wave in the Galactic disk
 - **Authors:** Chris Hamilton, Andrew Mummery, Joss Bland-Hawthorn

 - **Abstract**
 Stars in the Galactic disk have mean radial velocities $\overline{v}_R$ that oscillate as a function of angular momentum $J_\varphi$. This `$J_\varphi$-${\overline{v}}_R$ wave' signal also exhibits a systematic phase shift when stars are binned by their dynamical temperatures. However, the origin of the wave is unknown. Here we use linear perturbation theory to derive a simple analytic formula for the $J_\varphi$-$\overline{v}_R$ signal that depends on the equilibrium properties of the Galaxy and the history of recent perturbations to it. The formula naturally explains the phase shift, but also predicts that different classes of perturbation should drive $J_\varphi$-$\overline{v}_R$ signals with very different morphologies. Ignoring the self-gravity of disk fluctuations, it suggests that neither a distant tidal kick (e.g., from the Sgr dwarf) nor a rigidly-rotating Galactic bar can produce a qualitatively correct $J_\varphi$-$\overline{v}_R$ wave signal. However, short-lived spiral arms can, and by performing an MCMC fit we identify a spiral perturbation that drives a $J_\varphi$-${\overline{v}}_R$ signal in reasonable agreement with the data. We verify the analytic formula with test particle simulations, finding it to be highly accurate when applied to dynamically cold stellar populations. More work is needed to deal with hotter orbits, and to incorporate the fluctuations' self-gravity and the role of interstellar gas.
#### Compact HII Regions as Clocks of Massive-Star Formation: Evidence for Long Formation Timescales

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the luminosity function (LF) of compact HII regions in the context of the inertial--inflow model, in which massive stars assemble over extended, mass-dependent timescales. The comparison of the compact-HII-region LF with that of OB stars is traditionally used to estimate the compact-HII-phase lifetime and is often cited as evidence for the classical ``lifetime problem" of HII regions. We show that once stellar growth during the ionizing phase is included, the LF comparison instead constrains massive-star formation timescales, so the lifetime problem turns into evidence for prolonged growth. We illustrate the principle with a simple analytic model and then forward-model the two LFs with Monte Carlo realizations. We also derive revised Galactic LFs for compact HII regions and OB stars from the Red MSX Source survey and the Alma Luminous Star catalogue. The joint LF constraints imply a growth law where the formation time is about 2 Myr for a $60\,M_\odot$ star, with a square-root dependence on mass. The revised OB-star LF exhibits a statistically significant knee at $\log_{10}(L_{\rm k}/L_\odot)=5.0$, while the HII-region LF knee occurs at lower luminosity, as expected in the interpretation that HII regions are powered by stars that are still growing in mass. We conclude that massive stars in the Milky Way form over Myr timescales that increase with their final mass.
#### Dwarf Galaxy Number Counts within 25 Mpc: Predictions from Local Group Analogues in TNG50

 - **Abstract**
 The modern generation of wide-field galaxy surveys, such as LSST, Euclid and Roman, will enable studies of dwarf galaxies $(10^6 \leq M_\ast / M_\odot \leq 10^9)$ beyond the Local Group (LG) in unprecedented detail. Improved theoretical understanding of this population is necessary to guide these observations, since predictions in this regime are generally limited to specific environments like the LG. We present predictions for the population of dwarf galaxies from the TNG50 run of the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, focusing on the environments within $1 < D / \mathrm{Mpc} < 25$ of LG analogues at $z = 0$. In the simulated sample, there are $\sim 1,000$ and $\sim 12,000$ dwarf galaxies within $10$ and $25$ Mpc, respectively. We compare our results with the 50 Mpc Galaxy Catalog and estimate that current observations are highly incomplete at low masses: for $10^6 \leq M_\ast / M_\odot \leq 10^7$ $(-13 \lesssim M_r \lesssim -10)$, we find completeness fractions of $\sim 23 \%$ within $10$ Mpc and $\sim 4 \%$ within $25$ Mpc. The simulated galaxies below the completeness limits of the observations exist in a range of environments, with notable populations of field dwarfs at all distances and satellites around centrals with masses $10^8 \lesssim M_\ast / M_\odot \lesssim 10^{11}$ within $10-25$ Mpc. We find that there are $\sim 8$ times more quiescent dwarf galaxies in the TNG50 sample than are currently cataloged. Our results suggest that upcoming observations should uncover a substantial population of dwarf galaxies, and that $\gtrsim 15 \%$ of these will be red, currently quenched galaxies in the field.

 - **Abstract**
 Mass transfer between non-degenerate stars is a fundamental but still poorly understood process in binary evolution. The commonly used rotationally limited accretion prescription in detailed binary evolution simulations that account for stellar rotation generally yields low accretion efficiencies that are difficult to reconcile with several observational constraints. We present a physically-motivated mass-accretion prescription in which accretion or decretion disks regulate the angular momentum transported to the accretor, thereby allowing for continued accretion at near-critical rotation. The accretion efficiency can be calculated from the conservation of the mass and the angular momentum of the disk. Analytical estimates show that the accretion efficiency depends on stellar rotation and mass ratio for direct impact accretion, and additionally on stellar radius and orbital separation in the disk accretion regime. The overall mass-weighted accretion efficiencies are close to the values expected near the threshold rotation rate, where the accreted specific angular momentum declines sharply. Applying this model to binary evolution simulations, we find that rotationally limited accretion systematically underestimates Be-star masses in Be+subdwarf O/B-type star (sdOB) systems, whereas the disk-star coupling model can produce more massive Be stars that are consistent with observations. The final binary component masses depend not only on accretion efficiency but also core-envelope mass ratio, which itself depends sensitively on the assumed overshooting. We find that our new disk-star coupling model with reduced overshooting yields component masses for Be+sdOB systems that are in closer agreement with observations.

 - **Abstract**
 I describe an `oct-tree' N-body code which randomly shifts, reorients, and resizes the root cell at each time step. Averaging over a plurality of root cell positions and orientations statistically restores translational and rotational invariance. The potentials and forces which result can be much more accurate than those obtained from a single force calculation. In this paper, the principle of averaging is tested on static configurations. The next paper will show how this technique can substantially improve global energy, momentum, and angular momentum conservation at a negligible computational cost.
#### Reversal of Spin: Comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak

 - **Abstract**
 The rotations of cometary nuclei are known to change in response to outgassing torques. The nucleus of comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak exhibited particularly dramatic rotational changes when near perihelion in 2017 April. Here, we use archival Hubble Space Telescope observations from 2017 December to study the post-perihelion lightcurve of the nucleus and to assess the nucleus size. From both Hubble photometry and non-gravitational acceleration measurements we find a diminutive nucleus with effective radius r = 500+/-100 m. Systematic optical variations are consistent with a two-peaked (i.e., rotationally symmetric) lightcurve with period 0.60+/-0.01 days, substantially different from periods measured earlier in 2017. The spin of the nucleus likely reversed between perihelion in 2017 April and December as a result of the strong outgassing torque. We infer a dimensionless moment arm k = 0.013, about twice the median value in short-period comets. The lightcurve range of 0.4 magnitudes indicates a projected nucleus axis ratio greater than 1.4:1, while the active fraction of the nucleus decreased from 2.4 in 2001 (suggesting augmentation of the gas production by sublimating coma ice grains) to 0.14 in 2017, a result of long-term modification of the surface. We find that the physical lifetime of this small nucleus to spin-up is short compared to the reported 1500 year dynamical time spent in the current orbit. Two limiting reconciliations of this inequality are suggested. The nucleus could be in a state of unusually strong activity, leading us to over-estimate the average mass loss rate and outgassing torque and so to under-estimate the physical lifetime. Alternatively, the nucleus could be the surviving remnant of a once larger body for which outgassing torques were less effective in changing the spin.

 - **Abstract**
 The unpredictability of solar filament eruptions presents major challenges for forecasting space weather, as such eruptions frequently drive coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that impact the heliosphere. While nearby flux emergence is often linked to their destabilisation, the specific characteristics of both the emerging flux and the filament that determine whether an eruption occurs remain unclear. We report observations of a quiescent filament that did not erupt following the nearby emergence of active region NOAA 13270 and a subsequent C-class flare in April 2023. Our analysis combines multi-viewpoint extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging and X-ray imaging with EUV spectroscopy, radio imaging and measurements of, and extrapolations from, the photospheric magnetic field. We identify the formation of a coronal null point and fan-spine topology at the interface between the active region and filament which exhibited persistent slow reconnection, indicated by chromospheric brightenings, persistent radio emission, and plasma upflows. Our results indicate that ongoing reconnection and jets can relieve magnetic stress and enable filament stability, even when under strong perturbation. We suggest that the orientation of emerging flux relative to the ambient field is a critical parameter in filament evolution, and provide observational constraints for models of filament stability and eruption.

 - **Abstract**
 During its annual conference in 2025, the French Society of Astronomy \& Astrophysics (SF2A) hosted, for the fifth time, a special session dedicated to discussing the environmental transition within the French A\&A research community. During the 2025 workshop, the goal was to review four contemporary topics within the context of environmental transition actions and discussions: (1) institutional actions, (2) the early-career researchers singularity, (3) research infrastructures and tools, and (4) the geopolitical conditions under which A\&A research remains possible. The workshop concluded with a round-table discussion that brought together the various speakers so that every participant could express their ideas.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical end-to-end simulation in Adaptive Optics (AO) is a key tool in the development of complex systems, from the initial design to the commissioning phase. Based on our previous experience with PASSATA, we decided to develop a new AO simulation framework in Python language, naming it SPECULA (short for: Scalable Parallel Execution of Computations Upscaling Large Adaptive optics simulations). Following an object-oriented approach, the physical entities are modeled as processing objects connected to each other to exchange data objects. A simulation is run by providing its description instead of writing and executing a specific script. The Python language and its library flexibility allowed us to write one single code that can be run on CPU and GPU platforms. We put a strong focus on computational efficiency, relying on CuPy and its interface to access the CUDA-stream mechanism. Moreover, SPECULA is capable of distributed computations over multiple processing nodes, making it suitable to run in an HPC environment, as tested on the Italian supercomputer Leonardo. SPECULA can also be used in laboratory environment to implement a hybrid simulation, allowing us to interface simulated and concrete objects: this feature was demonstrated in the Adaptive Optics laboratories at Arcetri Observatory. In this paper, we describe the main characteristics of SPECULA, show some relevant examples of its use, and finally draw our goals for the future.
#### Galaxies caught in transition: the role of group environment in shaping the mass-size relation in the local Universe

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar mass-size relation is a sensitive probe of how environment shapes galaxy structure. We analyse this relation in the local Universe for galaxies in compact groups (CGs), low-mass groups ($M_{\rm vir} \leq 10^{13}~M_{\odot}$), and high-mass groups, comparing them to field galaxies using data from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey. Galaxies are classified as early types (ETGs; $n \geq 2.5$, $(u-r)_0 \geq 2.3$), late types (LTGs; $n < 2.5$, $(u-r)_0 < 2.3$), transition galaxies (TGs; $n < 2.5$, $(u-r)_0 \geq 2.3$), and others (OGs; $n \geq 2.5$, $(u-r)_0 < 2.3$). We find that ETGs and OGs show no significant environmental dependence: their mass-size slopes and intercepts are statistically consistent across CGs, groups, and the field. LTGs also follow similar relations in the field and in most groups, with only a modest tendency for LTGs in CGs to be smaller at fixed stellar mass. By contrast, TGs display a clear environmental signal: in groups the slope steepens to $\alpha \sim 0.4$ (versus $\alpha \sim 0.2$ in the field) and their sizes are smaller than in the field, with non-overlapping 95\% posterior intervals. These trends suggest that TGs in denser environments are more structurally evolved, likely owing to enhanced bulge prominence and fading of the outer disc, consistent with the Sérsic-index distributions, which show an excess of TGs with $n_r \gtrsim 1.5$ in groups and CGs. Our findings highlight TGs as an environmentally sensitive population, providing insight into the structural transformation of galaxies in group environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of a pilot observational wide-field VLBI campaign on probing scattering properties of the partly ionized interstellar medium towards the Galactic plane sky region between $28^\circ<l<36^\circ$ and $|b|<1^\circ$. This covers the region where the Galactic bar connects to the spiral arms and where a lot of star formation is currently ongoing. The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of the whole region were performed in a special mode with multiple phase centers at L-band (1.4 -- 1.8 GHz) during April-June 2022 and a year later complemented by sessions at S (2.2 -- 2.4 GHz) and C-band (4.6 -- 5.0 GHz) partially covering the pilot region. We found compelling evidence that target sources are subject to scattering. The total detection rate in L, S and C-bands is 1.5, 3.4 and 9.2 per cent, respectively, and approximately scales with the square of the observation frequency. The low rate values imply that scattering is strong. Its power is non-uniform across the Galactic plane and it can be approximated by a Gaussian with a width of about $2^\circ$ peaking at the Galactic mid-plane. One of the brightest sources of the field shows anisotropic scattering, with a $\lambda^2$ dependence of its observed angular size, along a position angle of $26^\circ$ aligned with the line of constant Galactic latitude. We estimate the turbulence dissipation scale $r_\text{in}\approx1500$ km toward the source J1833+0015.
