 - **Abstract**
 In the hierarchical assembly framework, the accretion history of the Milky Way is crucial to understand its evolution. However, in massive mergers, integrals of motion are not strictly conserved, redistributing accreted stars across dynamical spaces, such as energy-angular momentum ($E-L_z$). Additionally, the in situ disc becomes kinematically heated, acquiring halo-like orbits. Consequently, even for minor mergers, which should preserve dynamical coherence, we expect their kinematic-defined samples to be contaminated by both the massive merger(s) and the disc stars. This study aims at quantifying this contamination in known accreted halo substructures. As they are defined by kinematics, we aim at cleaning their samples analysing only chemical properties. We applied the kinematic selection criteria for the halo substructures to the Gaia EDR3 and APOGEE DR17 data. Then we adopted a Gaussian Mixture Model approach to chemically compare different substructures on a star-by-star basis, taking into account several abundances (Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, Mn, Al, and C). We argue that the chemical properties of Sequoia point towards a shared origin with GSE. Heracles, Thamnos and the Helmi Stream all likely comprise GSE and heated disc stars in a significant amount. Besides these two populations, we identified stars with chemical and orbital properties compatible with Sagittarius in the Helmi Stream and with $\omega$ Cen in Thamnos. Finally, GSE itself is contaminated by Sagittarius. Halo stars chemically compatible with GSE are spread throughout the $E-L_z$ space and considerably contaminate every halo substructure studied in this work. None of these substructures appears to be a unique population of stars with its own origin. In addition to GSE, they all appear to be mixtures of stars chemically compatible either with the metal-poor disc, Sagittarius, $\omega$ Cen, or with a combination of them.
#### The Broadband View of the Bare Seyfert PG 1426+015: Relativistic Reflection, the Soft Excess and the Importance of Oxygen

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a deep, coordinated $XMM$-$Newton$ + $NuSTAR$ observation of the type 1 Seyfert PG 1426+015, a source of particular interest as the most massive reverberation-mapped black hole to date ($\log [M_{\rm{BH}}/M_{\odot}]$ = $9.01^{+0.11}_{-0.16}$). The high-resolution RGS data confirm the 'bare' nature of the source, showing no evidence for absorption beyond the Galactic column, while the broadband spectrum unambiguously reveals the presence of relativistic reflection from the innermost accretion disc (in the form of a relativistically broadened iron emission and associated Compton reflection hump) as well as confirming the presence of the strong soft excess reported previously. We explore whether relativistic reflection can successfully account for the soft excess along with the higher-energy reflection features, utilizing the two most-commonly used reflection codes (REFLIONX, XILLVER). Ultimately we find that both models are able to successfully reproduce the soft excess, though in the case of the XILLVER model this is contingent on reducing the strength of the O VIII line included in the model, as otherwise this feature prevents the model from reproducing the data. The reflection models that successfully reproduce the broadband data imply a relatively high density for the accretion disc of $\log [n_{\rm{e}} / \rm{cm}^{-3}] \sim 18$, consistent with the loose anti-correlation seen from other AGN in the $\log [n_{\rm{e}} / \rm{cm}^{-3}]$ vs $\log[m_{\rm{BH}} \dot{m}^2]$ plane, as well as a moderate-to-high black hole spin of $a^* \gtrsim 0.7$. This preliminary spin constraint is strongly dependent on the assumption that the soft excess is dominated by relativistic reflection.

 - **Abstract**
 The dust emission polarization spectrum -- how the polarization percentage changes with wavelength -- serves as a probe of dust grain properties in star-forming regions. In this paper, we present 89 $\mu$m - 214 $\mu$m polarization spectrum measurements obtained from SOFIA/HAWC+ for three star-forming clouds -- OMC1, M17, and W3. We find that all three clouds have an overall decreasing polarization percentage with increasing wavelength (i.e., a ``falling polarization spectrum''). We use SOFIA and Herschel data to create column density and temperature maps for each cloud. We fit for the slope of the polarization spectrum at each sky position in each cloud, and using the Pearson $r$ coefficient we probe each cloud for possible correlations of slope with column density and slope with temperature. We also create plots of slope vs. column density and slope vs. temperature for each cloud. For the case of OMC1, our results are consistent with those presented by J. Michail et al., who carried out a similar analysis for that cloud. Our plots of polarization spectrum slope vs. column density reveal that for each cloud there exists a critical column density below which a falling polarization spectrum is not observed. For these more diffuse sightlines, the polarization spectrum is instead flat or slightly rising. This finding is consistent with a hypothesis presented 25 years ago in a paper led by R. Hildebrand based on Kuiper Airborne Observatory data. This hypothesis is that regions shielded from near-IR radiation are required to produce a sharply falling polarization spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 We use high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations to model mechanical and thermal feedback from AGN onto the evolution of Seyfert-type galaxies, studying the morphology of central galaxies growing within dark matter (DM) halos with masses logM/Mo ~11.8 at z=0. In Paper I, we focused on the end products at z=0, here we analyze evolution for z<10. Black holes (SMBHs) of ~10^6 Mo were seeded at z~9.1 and z~3.7, producing jets along their spin axes. Obtained SMBH accretion rates vary in the range ~0.3-10^(-4) of the Eddington rate. We compared the basic properties of galaxies, such as star formation rate, masses, gas and stellar fractions, bulge-to-disk mass ratios, SMBH masses, etc., over the range of redshifts. Our results indicate that jets and associated over-pressured bubbles have substantial effects on Seyfert galaxy evolution, including properties of the interstellar and circumgalactic medium (ISM and CGM), and even beyond. This feedback can suppress and even quench star formation, reduce stellar mass and gas fraction, modify the bulge-to-disk ratios, drive outflows from galaxies and host DM halos, and metal-enrich the CGM. The jets are largely but not exclusively contained within galaxies. However, over-pressured bubbles cross and modify the composition of the CGM and IGM, their thermodynamic and dynamic state, and generate vorticity. The CGM emerges as a complex region, where action of galactic outflows and jet-formed bubbles combines with the influx from cosmological filaments and diffuse accretion. Ultimately, the above processes affect the gas balance within the galaxy, its morphology, and gas supply to the SMBH, limiting its growth.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale galaxy redshift surveys conducted over the last couple of decades have proven crucial in deepening our understanding of structure growth in the Universe and galaxy evolution. While there have been several such surveys, until now those that achieve the high completeness and precision necessary to probe the low-mass end of galaxy groups have been limited to relatively low redshifts ($z\lesssim0.3$), with surveys exploring the more distant Universe being constrained by small sample sizes and/or low redshift completeness. The recent Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) aims to explore galaxy environment over the last $\sim6$ Gyr with a completeness level comparable to the most complete local Universe surveys ($>85\%$). In this work, we present the galaxy group catalogue for the D10-COSMOS field from DEVILS, which achieves a redshift completeness of $90\%$ for galaxies with $Y<21.2$ mag. We showcase the science potential by exploring the impact of environment on the fraction and power of active galactic nuclei (AGN), finding that satellites in galaxy groups show no evidence of altered AGN properties, while satellites in clusters exhibit increased AGN fractions but decreased AGN luminosities.

 - **Abstract**
 This work explores the morphology and dynamical properties of cores within rich superclusters, highlighting their role as transitional structures in the large-scale structure of the Universe. Using projected and radial velocity distributions of member galaxies, we identify cores as dense structures that, despite being gravitationally bound, are not yet dynamically relaxed. However, they exhibit a tendency toward virialisation, evolving in a self-similar manner to massive galaxy clusters but on a larger scale. Morphological analysis reveals that cores are predominantly filamentary, reflecting quasi-linear formation processes consistent with the Zeldovich approximation. Our estimates of the entropy confirm their intermediate dynamical state, with relaxation levels varying across the sample. Mass estimates indicate efficient accretion processes, concentrating matter into gravitationally bound systems. We conclude that cores are important environments where galaxy evolution and hierarchical assembly occur, bridging the gap between supercluster-scale structures and virialised clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar surface abundances are records of the state of the gas from which stars formed, and thus trace how individual elements have mixed into the surrounding medium following their ejection from stars. In this work, we test the common assumption of instantaneous and homogeneous metal mixing during the formation of the first Population II stars by characterizing the chemical homogeneity of the gas in simulated star-forming environments enriched by Population III stellar feedback. Testing the homogeneity of metal mixing in this time period is necessary for understanding the spread of abundances in the most metal-poor stars, and the (in)homogeneity of individual sites of star formation. Using Aeos, a suite of star-by-star cosmological simulations, we quantify how gas abundances change over space and time relative to Population II stellar abundances using Mahalanobis distances, a measure of covariance-normalized dissimilarity. We find that the homogeneous mixing assumption holds only within $\sim100$ pc of a star-forming region and $\sim 7$ Myr following the star formation event. Beyond this regime, deviations between stellar and gas abundances increase until they become indistinguishable from assuming a homogeneous mix of metals averaged over the initial mass function. This highlights the limited applicability of assuming instantaneous and homogeneous mixing in realistic halo environments at high redshift. We identify critical mixing scales that are necessary to explore chemical evolution in the early Universe. These scales can be applied to determine the precision needed for accurate chemical tagging of observed data and to explore parameter space with analytical models.
#### The impact of rotational mixing in intermediate-age star clusters with extended main-sequence turn-offs and extended red clumps

 - **Abstract**
 The extended main-sequence turn-offs (eMSTOs) and extended red clumps (eRCs) observed in intermediate-age star clusters challenge the traditional understanding of clusters as simple stellar populations. Recently, eMSTOs have been interpreted as signatures of stellar rotation. In this work, we test the effectiveness of rotational mixing in shaping the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of star clusters. We computed a set of separate single-age synthetic stellar populations, referred to as "Base Stellar Populations" (BSPs), including stellar rotation. These BSPs were generated from two grids of stellar models that share the same input physics but differ in the efficiency of rotational mixing. We used an optimization algorithm to determine the best combination of BSPs to fit the CMDs of two star clusters: the Small Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 419 and the Milky Way cluster NGC 1817. The synthetic clusters with weak rotational mixing provide the best fit to both the eMSTO and eRC features for both clusters, and are consistent with the luminosities and asteroseismic masses we derived for eRC stars in NGC 1817. In contrast, synthetic clusters with strong rotational mixing result in overly bright post-main-sequence stars, inconsistent with observations. This suggests that, for intermediate-mass stars, the influence of rotational mixing of chemical elements on stellar evolution cannot be so strong as to significantly increase the post-main-sequence luminosity. A simple test suggests that accounting for self-extinction by decretion discs in equator-on fast rotators could influence inferred rotation distributions and help reconcile the projected rotational velocity discrepancy across the eMSTO between models and observations.
#### A statistical look on kinematic planes of satellite galaxies I: frequency and properties in TNG50 MW/M31-like galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We use the TNG50 simulation to explore the possible existence of satellite galaxy sets, with fixed-in-time identities, forming kinematically-persistent planes (KPPs) along cosmic time around 190 MW/M31-like galaxies. This is the first study to assess their frequency within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. We identify KPPs around 46 of these host galaxies, with at least 25\% of their satellites in such configurations. Thereby, KPPs appear more frequent than previously reported, appearing in $\sim24\%$ of MW/M31-like systems, and in $\sim40\%$ of those populated with $N_{\rm sat}\geq9$. We find a dependency of the former frequency on the minimum satellite stellar mass cut, suggesting that it would increase with higher mass resolution. KPP satellite members form a distinct set compared to satellites outside KPPs, located at further distances from the center of their host and maintaining higher specific angular momentum since high redshift. KPP satellites form thin and oblate planes in positional space during long periods of cosmic time. We statistically confirm that KPPs form a kind of backbone of observationally-detected positional planes, and that, in velocity space, KPPs behave as kinematic morphological disks. We show that KPP formation, defined as the time when satellite orbital poles align around a specific, fixed direction (occurring at Universe age $\sim4$ Gyr), predates the end of halo's fast-phase of mass assembly, indicating that halo processes do not drive this clustering. Finally, our results are broadly consistent with the MW's kinematic plane at $z=0$ concerning its morphological properties and degree of satellite orbital poles clustering, mitigating the tension between the existence of these structures and the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.

 - **Abstract**
 Predicting the statistical properties of the neutral hydrogen (HI) density field during reionization is an important step in using upcoming 21 cm observations to constrain models of reionization. Semi-numerical models of reionization are often coupled with the collapse fraction field $f_{\text{coll}}(\mathbf{x})$, which determines the fraction of dark matter within halos. In this work, we improve upon earlier prescriptions that compute $f_{\text{coll}}$ based on the dark matter overdensity $\delta(\mathbf{x})$ alone, to include more information about the environment in the form of eigenvalues of the tidal tensor. We compute the mean of the $f_{\text{coll}}$ conditioned on these eigenvalues from a set of high-resolution, small-volume simulations and use them to sample the $f_{\text{coll}}$ field of a low-resolution, large-volume simulation. We subsequently use a semi-numerical code for reionization to compute the HI density field and its power spectrum, and benchmark our results against a reference high-resolution, large-volume simulation. Across variations in redshift, ionized fraction, grid resolution, and minimum halo mass, our method recovers the large-scale HI power spectrum with errors at the $\lesssim 2\%-5\%$ level for $k \lesssim 0.5~ h~ \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, providing a substantial improvement over the $\sim 10\%$ results previously obtained using density-only conditioning. Overall, this makes our method a simple yet efficient tool for forward modeling HI maps during reionization.
#### Fermi-LAT Detected Gamma-ray Emission Likely Associated with SNR Kes 78

 - **Abstract**
 We have analyzed the GeV gamma-ray emission in the region of the supernova remnant (SNR) Kes 78 using $\sim$16.7 years of Fermi-LAT observations and found that the catalog sources 4FGL J1852.4+0037e and 4FGL J1851.8$-$0007c are better represented as two extended sources modeled as `2Ext'. One of them, designated as E2, is located at R.A.$=282.86^\circ$, Dec.$=-0.11^\circ$ with the 68\% containment radius $R_{68} = 0.31^\circ$, and is detected with a significance of 15.2$\sigma$ in the 0.2--500 GeV energy range. The gamma-ray emission of source E2 is well described by a log-parabola (LogP) spectral model with spectral index $\Gamma$ = 1.2 and curvature $\beta$ = 0.3. The fitting with electron-proton number ratio $K_{\rm ep}=0.01$ indicates that the GeV emission of source E2 is dominated by hadronic emission. Given the dense molecular environment surrounding the middle-aged SNR Kes 78, the hadronic scenario provides a natural explanation for the observed GeV emission. The extended source E2 can also be replaced with two point sources. One of them, designated as PTS1, is coincident with the newly discovered PSR J1852$-$0002g within the 68\% positional uncertainty circle, indicating a possible gamma-ray contribution from this PSR. The gamma-ray spectrum of source PTS1 can be well described by a LogP spectral shape. The synchro-curvature radiation model provides a satisfactory spectral fit for source PTS1, suggesting that some of the GeV emission from the Kes 78 region might possibly originate from the magnetosphere of PSR J1852$-$0002g.

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread in the interstellar medium (ISM) of Solar metallicity galaxies, where they play a critical role in ISM heating, cooling, and reprocessing stellar radiation. The PAH fraction, the abundance of PAHs relative to total dust mass, is a key parameter in ISM physics. Using JWST and MUSE observations of 42 galaxies from the PHANGS survey, we analyze the PAH fraction in over 17 000 H II regions spanning a gas-phase oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) = 8.0-8.8 (Z ~ 0.2-1.3 Zsun), and ~400 isolated supernova remnants (SNRs). We find a significantly lower PAH fraction toward H II regions compared to a reference sample of diffuse ISM areas at matched metallicity. At 12+log(O/H) > 8.2, the PAH fraction toward H II regions is strongly anti-correlated with the local ionization parameter, suggesting that PAH destruction is correlated with ionized gas and/or hydrogen-ionizing UV radiation. At lower metallicities, the PAH fraction declines steeply in both H II regions and the diffuse ISM, likely reflecting less efficient PAH formation in metal-poor environments. Carefully isolating dust emission from the vicinity of optically-identified supernova remnants, we see evidence for selective PAH destruction from measurements of lower PAH fractions, which is, however, indistinguishable at ~50 pc scales. Overall, our results point to ionizing radiation as the dominant agent of PAH destruction within H II regions, with metallicity playing a key role in their global abundance in galaxies.

 Submillimeter astronomy is poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Universe by revealing cosmic phenomena hidden from optical and near-infrared observations, particularly those associated with interstellar dust, molecular gas, and star formation. The Xue-shan-mu-chang 15-meter submillimeter telescope (XSMT-15m), to be constructed at a premier high-altitude site (4813 m) in Qinghai, China, marks a major milestone for Chinese astronomy, establishing the China mainland's first independently developed, world-class submillimeter facility. Equipped with state-of-the-art instruments, XSMT-15m will address a diverse range of frontier scientific questions spanning extragalactic astronomy, Galactic structure, time-domain astrophysics, and astrochemistry. In synergy with current and forthcoming observatories, XSMT-15m will illuminate the formation and evolution of galaxies, unravel the physical and chemical processes shaping the interstellar medium, and explore transient phenomena in the submillimeter regime. These capabilities will advance our understanding across extragalactic astronomy, Galactic ecology, astrochemistry, and time-domain astrophysics, inaugurating a new era for submillimeter research in China and the northern hemisphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar substructures within tidal debris preserve information about their progenitor galaxies' properties, offering insights into hierarchical mass assembly. We examine a compact stellar system (CSS) around the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 7531, including the shell-like tidal debris. Our goals are to determine the nature of the CSS, reconstruct the accretion history, and understand how the large, diffuse shell-like structure formed. We present photometric measurements of the shell-like debris and CSS using DESI Legacy Imaging Survey (LS) data. We obtained Keck/LRIS spectroscopic data for the CSS to confirm its association with NGC 7531 and to derive its star formation history (SFH). Deep ($\sim$27.9 mag/arcsec$^{2}$) amateur telescope images enabled complete characterization of the tidal debris structure. We confirm the CSS is associated with NGC 7531. We rename it NGC 7531-UCD1, since its stellar mass ($3.7_{-0.7}^{+1.0}\times 10^6$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$), half-light radius ($R_{h} = 0.13 \pm 0.05$ arcsec) and SFH place it as an ultra-compact dwarf galaxy (UCD). NGC 7531-UCD1 was likely a nuclear star cluster (NSC) that was tidally stripped into a UCD- this is further supported by the presence of tidal tails. We quantify the shell-like debris' mass as $M_\star\sim 3$--$11\times 10^8 M_\odot$, implying a merger mass ratio of ~300:1 to 10:1. Our amateur telescope images confirm new pieces of debris, previously unclear in the DESI LS images. N-body simulations reproduce the tidal features, requiring a near radial orbit of the progenitor with two pericentric passages. The first passage coincides with the measured star formation enhancement ~1 Gyr ago. Our findings agree with predictions about the NSC to UCD formation pathway via tidal stripping, and further confirm the presence of these objects outside of our Milky Way.
#### Thermal SZ effect at the core of CL J1226.9+3332 revealed by NOEMA

 - **Abstract**
 We present first detailed maps of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect on a $z = 0.89$ cluster with the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). The high sensitivity of these observations enabled the effective identification and removal of the millimetre-wave sources contaminating the tSZ signal, thus isolating the influence of the cluster's hot electron gas on the cosmic microwave background radiation from other emissions. The tSZ observed with success by NOEMA is modelled together with previous single dish (IRAM 30-metre, Green Bank Telescope, and Caltech Sub-millimeter Observatory) observations to obtain the first core to outskirts (from $\sim$ 15 to $\sim$ 1500 kpc) pressure profile reconstruction on such a high redshift galaxy cluster. High angular resolution NOEMA observations have shown that the pressure profile is flat in the core of the cluster. These observations confirm the disturbed nature of CL J1226.9+3332 and map for the first time the distribution of its thermal gas at arcsecond scales, in the environments of the central cluster galaxy. Our results showcase NOEMA's excellent capabilities to complement and enhance the data provided by other millimetre-wave instruments in resolving the core of high-redshift clusters via tSZ emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate mass transport, mixing, and disk evolution in non-radiative black hole accretion flows using Lagrangian tracer particles embedded in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations. Our simulation suite spans magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and standard and normal evolution (SANE) states across a range of black hole spins. By tracking tracer trajectories, we directly measure both advective inflow and stochastic spreading of fluid elements. The tracer distributions are well described by a combination of coherent inward drift and Gaussian-like broadening, consistent with an advection-diffusion picture. MADs exhibit systematically faster inflow than SANEs, with retrograde flows showing the most rapid infall; the innermost stable circular orbit leaves little imprint in MADs but remains more visible in SANEs. Turbulent fluctuations drive strong radial dispersion in all cases, with a superdiffusive scaling of sigma ~ t^0.95 in MADs and sigma ~ t^0.75 in SANEs for high-spin prograde disks. Mixing times decrease toward the event horizon and are consistently shorter in MADs and retrograde configurations. Tracers also reveal how accretion sources shift over time: turbulence draws inflow from a broad range of initial radii, with rapid torus depletion in MADs driving the mean source radius outward as r ~ t^(2/3), while SANEs evolve more gradually with r ~ t^(1/2). We show that the finite mass of the initial torus has a strong influence on late-time behavior, especially in MADs, where imprints of differently sized initial conditions may be accessible as early as t ~ 10000 GM/c^3.
