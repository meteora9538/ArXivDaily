 - **Abstract**
 The ESA Gaia mission has revolutionized our understanding of the white dwarf population, delivering an unprecedented census of these nearby remnants and revealing previously unseen structures in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. However, while Gaia has expanded the scope of white dwarf astrophysics, it has also exposed new questions related to atmospheric composition, spectral evolution, crystallization, magnetism, and merger-driven pathways. Many of these open problems are encoded in the detailed morphology of the Gaia HR diagram, where precise spectroscopic characterization is essential for interpreting the underlying physical processes. Spectroscopic characterization, obtainable with current and future ESO facilities, can provide the effective temperatures and surface gravities that are required to derive accurate white dwarf masses, cooling ages, and luminosities. These fundamental parameters not only enable studies of spectral evolution, interior physics, and the origin of magnetic and high-mass white dwarfs, but also guarantee the construction of robust mass distributions and luminosity functions, essential for constraining the initial-to-final mass relation, probing the initial mass function, and reconstructing the star formation history of the local Galaxy, among other applications. Looking toward the 2040s, future multi-fiber spectrographs operating in survey mode on 10--15 meter class telescopes will be able to collect a complete spectroscopic sample of white dwarf, enabling the detailed characterization of their population. Achieving spectroscopic completeness for the nearby Galactic population and securing high signal-to-noise, moderate-to-high resolution spectra across the HR diagram with ESO instrumentation will be critical steps toward resolving these longstanding questions in white dwarf astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 The millimeter/sub-millimeter (mm/sub-mm) sky remains a rich but under-explored frontier for transient and variable phenomena. A wide-field, high-sensitivity instrument with a large aperture and degree-scale field of view would open this regime, enabling both systematic survey monitoring and rapid-response follow-up. Key science opportunities include Galactic Plane monitoring and surveys to discover and characterize time-variable emission from young stellar objects, magnetically active and flaring stars, compact binaries, and explosive events, as well as prompt responses to multi-messenger alerts with large localization regions (e.g., gravitational-wave triggers). Multi-band capability, rapid slewing, and high sensitivity are essential to probe energetic processes such as jet launching, relativistic shocks and accretion flows in unprecedented detail. While long-term monitoring is well established at radio and optical/infrared wavelengths, mm/sub-mm observations uniquely bridge the spectral gap between these regimes, directly probing obscured environments that are inaccessible elsewhere. Large-scale monitoring programs will yield legacy datasets crucial for population studies through the 2040s and beyond.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the formation, evolution, and chemical diversity of exoplanets are now central areas of astrophysics research. White dwarfs provide a uniquely sensitive laboratory for studying the end stages of planetary-system evolution and for probing the bulk composition of both rocky and volatile-rich exoplanetary material. In the 2030s new facilities will transform our ability to carry out \textit{``industrial-scale''} astrophysics, leading to fundamental results and new challenges for the next decade. By combining the volume of data surveyed by the ESA {\em Gaia} mission and Vera C. Rubin Observatory with the next-generation of spectroscopic facilities, the European Southern Observatory (ESO) community will be in a position to obtain an unbiased census of evolved planetary systems, constrain the composition of thousands of disrupted planetesimals, and connect these signatures to Galactic populations and stellar birth environments. Thus, it is now the time for assessing those challenges and preparing for the future. This white paper outlines key science opportunities arising in the next decade and the technological requirements of future ESO facilities in enabling transformative discoveries in the 2040s. These future facilities will have to combine a number of features that are crucial for studying evolved planetary systems at white dwarfs, such as broad optical to near-infrared coverage, a high sensitivity at blue wavelengths, multi-resolution capability, massive multi-plexing, and time-domain reactivity.
#### Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Shaping Galaxies and Their Stars with Stellar Population Gradients, IMF Variations and Environmental Drivers in Cluster Early-Type Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 This white paper highlights how stellar population gradients, chemical abundance patterns, stellar initial mass function (IMF) variations, and structural signatures in early-type galaxies (ETGs), measured at faint and large galactocentric radii, out to $\sim4R_e$, provide powerful diagnostics of their formation and evolutionary histories. These observables encode the combined effects of early dissipative star formation, subsequent accretion and mergers, and internal feedback processes. Achieving such measurements requires high-signal-to-noise, spatially resolved U-band--optical--near-IR spectroscopy at large radii, with enough spatial resolution to study the variation of these properties on $\sim$kpc scales. These capabilities can only be delivered by a 30\,m-class telescope. Disentangling these internal processes from environmental influences further demands observations of galaxies across clusters spanning a wide range of evolutionary stages and local environments. The nearby Virgo, Perseus, and Coma clusters, without any comparable nearby counterparts in the Southern Hemisphere, offer ideal laboratories for this work. Such observations will place stringent constraints on the formation mechanism of ETGs, connecting local cluster ETGs to their high-redshift progenitors. This white paper outlines several key science cases enabled by such a facility: (1) mapping stellar population gradients across environments; (2) tracing IMF variations as a function of evolutionary stage and environment; (3) reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of galaxies through deep integral-field spectroscopy and imaging; and (4) identifying and studying compact and relic systems as progenitors of present-day ETGs.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection and characterization of protoplanets in protoplanetary disks around young stars is emerging as a transformative field that will redefine our understanding of how planetary systems form. While current facilities have revealed the diversity of mature exoplanets and the complex structures of disks, we still lack the crucial observational link between them: a statistically meaningful census of planets caught in the act of formation. This white paper argues that such a breakthrough requires access to the nearest and most informative star-forming regions, roughly half of which are poorly accessible or entirely unreachable from Cerro Armazones. Although the ELT alone will strongly impact our knowledge of planet formation, its location prevents Europe from fully exploiting the necessary parameter space. A 30-40 m telescope in the northern hemisphere is therefore essential for obtaining diffraction-limited imaging of protoplanets and disks across the entire sky, enabling robust demographics, exploiting synergies with ngVLA, Gaia, and other facilities covering the north, and ensuring that Europe remains at the forefront of the planet-formation revolution in the coming decades.

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf galaxies dominate the galaxy population in the nearby Universe and occupy the regime where feedback, reionization, and environment exert their strongest influence on galaxy formation. Despite their importance, detailed spectroscopic constraints on the faintest dwarfs are currently limited to a handful of systems in the Local Volume, leaving the role of large-scale environment essentially unexplored at ultra-low stellar masses. A northern 30-40m class telescope equipped with a multiplexed optical integral-field spectrograph will enable a systematic, spatially resolved spectroscopic census of dwarf galaxies with $M_\star \sim 10^{5}-10^{7} M_\odot$ across a wide range of environments. A deep survey of the Coma Cluster, combined with targeted observations of dwarfs in clusters, groups, filaments, and low-density regions, will map star formation histories, chemical enrichment, and internal kinematics at unprecedented depth. This program will directly test models of dark-matter physics, early-Universe feedback, and environmental quenching in the lowest-mass galaxies, establishing dwarf galaxies as precision probes of both galaxy formation and fundamental physics.

 - **Abstract**
 The Extragalactic Low Surface Brightness (LSB, $\mu_V\gtrsim 27$ mag/arcsec$^2$) Universe represents a crucial, yet largely unseen, frontier in modern astrophysics. This faint realm holds the keys to completing our understanding of galaxy evolution, hierarchical assembly, and even the fundamental nature of dark matter. Our current theoretical models are inherently incomplete, largely mirroring the properties of the brightest, most easily observed objects. To overcome this critical bias and unlock the secrets of this realm, a transformative leap in observational capability is required. A 30 to 40m class telescope, leveraging unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution, especially with adaptive optics, is the essential tool to fundamentally probe these faint, low-density stellar regimes. This white paper details the transformative LSB science that such a facility, strategically positioned in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) to access crucial nearby structures and rich environments, can achieve.

 - **Abstract**
 Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are dense, compact stellar systems only a few parsecs across, located at galaxy centers. Their small sizes make them difficult to resolve spatially. NSCs often coexist with massive black holes, and both trace the dynamical state and evolution of their host galaxies. Dense stellar environments such as NSCs are also ideal sites for forming intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). To date, spatially resolved NSC properties, crucial for reconstructing dynamical and star-formation histories, have only been obtained for galaxies within 5 Mpc, using the highest-resolution instruments on the current class of very large telescopes. This severely limits spectroscopic studies, and a systematic, unbiased survey has never been accomplished. Because the vast majority of known NSCs are located in the Northern Hemisphere, only a 30-m-class telescope in the North can provide the statistical power needed to study their physical properties and measure the mass of coexisting central black holes. We propose leveraging the capabilities of a 30-m-class Northern telescope to obtain the first comprehensive, spatially resolved survey of NSCs, finally allowing us to unveil their formation pathways and their yet unknown connection with central massive black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars are at the core of our observations of the Universe up to the reionization epoch, both through their intense ionizing fluxes and through the energetic end products that release fresh elements into the interstellar medium. Our interpretation of very high redshift galaxies and transient phenomena depends on knowledge derived from massive star populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, with characteristics that only remotely resemble the conditions in the early Universe. However, the models supporting these interpretations have been tested in a narrow range of environments and carry significant uncertainties when extrapolated. Advancing in our understanding of the Universe beyond the Local Volume therefore requires extending massive star studies to conditions representative of the early Universe. The next generation of telescopes has the potential to accomplish this goal.

 - **Abstract**
 Star-forming dwarf galaxies in the local Universe, especially extremely metal-poor ones, can be considered analogous to early galaxies of the Epoch of Reionization (z >= 6). Currently available telescopes cannot adequately detect and measure heavy element recombination lines and certain faint collisionally excited lines, which are essential for exploring the effects and biases that potential inhomogeneities in electron temperature and density of the ionized gas may have on determining the chemical composition of these galaxies. On the other hand, the origin of very high-ionization lines (e.g. He II, [Ne V], C IV]) measured in the spectra of an important fraction of these objects remains unknown and a challenge to current stellar models, suggesting the presence of Population III-like stars and/or the existence of non-conventional ionizing sources. Obtaining very deep spectra for a selected sample of local star-forming dwarf galaxies would provide unprecedented constraints on their nature, ionization and true chemical abundances, and could change the metallicity scale we assume to understand the chemical evolution of galaxies over cosmic time.
#### Why the northern hemisphere needs a 30-40 m telescope and the science at stake: Massive stars in spiral galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 This document discusses the three main lines expected to dominate massive-star research in the 2040s, namely: (1) The role of metallicity in stellar evolution, especially in determining the end products such as gravitational-wave progenitors. (2) The initial mass function from the most massive stars to substellar objects. (3) The role of the environment in the different modes of star formation from compact star clusters to born-this-way associations and from massive clusters to small stellar groups. More specifically, we present the contributions to such science that would be enabled by a 30~m type telescope in the northern hemisphere studying spiral galaxies. Those can be grouped in three: our own Galaxy, the Milky Way; the other two spiral galaxies in the Local Group, M31 and M33; and other galaxies within 25 Mpc, such as M101, M51, and NGC~6946. This work is based on the fact that, as of today, no construction of a 30~m telescope has yet started in the northern hemisphere, so even in the best case scenario of such a hypothetical telescope, its full operation would not start until the late 2030s or early 2040s. It makes no assumptions about its location but supposes an instrumentation development similar to that of ELT.
#### Discovery of Isolated, Quenched, and Likely Backsplash Dwarf Galaxies near M101

 - **Abstract**
 I report the discovery of three faint, semi-resolved quiescent dwarf galaxies, two of which are strong backsplash candidates associated with the nearby satellite-sparse spiral M101 (D ~ 6.7 Mpc). The galaxies lie within the magnitude range MV ~ -7.70 to -8.2 and half-light radii rh ~ 110 to 204 pc. Shapiro DG-I (Sha DG-I/MAGE1412+5650) is a concurrently discovered and isolated galaxy. Shapiro DG-II (Sha DG-II) is a fainter dwarf and potential companion to the SMC-mass galaxy NGC 5585 (D ~ 6.84 Mpc). Shapiro DG-III (Sha DG-III) is an isolated dwarf on the edge of the ultra-faint regime. Hydrodynamical simulations suggest a backsplash population of galaxies that have been environmentally stripped by interactions with a host and ejected from the system, though they have not yet been definitively observed in the local universe. Considering their quenched stellar populations, indicated by the lack of coincident GALEX emission, relative distances, and fitting models, the galaxies are consistent with a backsplash origin and are pending follow-up. Analysis is performed to test whether the system's population can be explained by standard cosmology. A potential correlation is found between satellite abundances and halo masses calibrated by tidal indices in a sample of nearby MW-like galaxies, suggesting the importance of environmental density in the formation of dark matter subhaloes, though a larger sample is required. M101's sparse satellite system fits well in the relation and is in agreement with {\Lambda}CDM expectations.
#### Super-Eddington Chimneys: On the Cooling Evolution of Tidal Disruption Event Envelopes

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of a compact accretion disk following a tidal disruption event (TDE) requires that the shocked stellar debris cool efficiently as it settles toward the black hole. While recent simulations suggest that stream dissipation occurs rapidly, how the weakly bound debris subsequently loses its thermal energy to assemble a compact disk near the circularization radius remains uncertain. We investigate this cooling process using axisymmetric radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of quasi-hydrostatic 'TDE envelopes', initialized with the total mass, angular momentum, and binding energy expected from a complete stellar disruption. The envelopes, supported by radiation pressure on large scales and rotation near the circularization radius, evolve through a combination of radiative diffusion, turbulent mixing, and polar outflows. In our fiducial model, a quasi-steady state is achieved in which a polar outflow radiates and expels matter at several times the Eddington luminosity. This enables the envelope to cool and contract, forming a dense, rotationally supported ring near the circularization radius, but on a timescale roughly ten times shorter than the naive photon-diffusion timescale. Comparative models without radiation transport confirm that cooling, not purely adiabatic evolution, is essential to driving this rapid inflow. Nevertheless, across a range of envelope masses, the effective envelope cooling time scales only weakly with its optical depth, implying that advective and wind-driven energy transport dominate over diffusion. Our results demonstrate the cooling-induced contraction, even absent viscosity and associated black hole accretion, can produce luminosities and large photosphere radii consistent with early UV/optical TDE emission. However, more quantitative light-curve predictions must incorporate self-consistent formation and feeding of the envelope by fall-back accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the local distance ladder measurement of the Hubble constant in models where gravity is modified by a fifth force, an additional long-range interaction. In many such theories the force is screened; suppressed in dense environments but potentially active in galaxies used for distance calibration. We model this environmental dependence using three quantities that characterize each galaxy's large-scale gravitational environment: the external gravitational potential $\Phi$, acceleration $a$, and curvature $K$. Our baseline analysis recalibrates the SH0ES-team's Cepheid-supernova distance ladder, incorporating the fifth force via its impact on the Cepheid period-luminosity relation. Across models, a fifth force is strongly constrained, with posteriors concentrated around a null result. The inferred Hubble constant is $H_0 = 73.1 \pm 1.0 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, retaining the Hubble tension at $>5 \, \sigma$. As an additional test, we incorporate four independent Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) distance datasets into a joint Cepheid-TRGB-supernova calibration. These combined analyses further constrain the magnitude of fifth-force effects. Taken together, our results show that, across the class of screened fifth-force models we analyze, the calibration of the local distance ladder remains essentially unchanged, leaving the Hubble tension intact.

 - **Abstract**
 Underground laboratories provide the ultra-low background and low-vibration environments essential for rare-event searches, gravitational-wave detection, and quantum-sensing technologies. We report a comprehensive environmental characterisation of the Bedretto tunnel in Ticino, Switzerland, a site offering horizontal access, excellent infrastructure, and the potential to be be Europe's second-deepest and quietest underground laboratory. At the prospective physics site, located beneath an overburden exceeding 1400 m, we measure the cosmic-muon, gamma-ray, and neutron fluxes, as well as the radon concentration, magnetic-field spectrum, and seismic backgrounds. The muon flux is suppressed by six orders of magnitude relative to the surface, consistent with an effective depth of about 4000 metre water equivalent, gamma-ray and neutron measurements reflect the local geology and guide shielding requirements for future particle and nuclear physics experiments. Magnetic and seismic noise levels are found to be exceptionally low, meeting or exceeding the criteria for next-generation atom-interferometric gravitational-wave detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 The dust content of star-forming galaxies is generally positively correlated with their stellar mass. However, some recent JWST studies have shown the existence of a population of dwarf galaxies with an unexpectedly large dust attenuation. Using the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) data, we identified a sample of 1361 highly extincted low-mass (HELM) galaxies, defined as dwarf galaxies ($M_*<10^{8.5}$) with Av>1mag or more massive galaxies with an exceptionally high dust attenuation given their stellar mass (i.e., $Av>1.6log_{10}(M_*/Mo)-12.6$). The selection is performed using the multiparameter distribution obtained through a comprehensive spectral energy distribution fitting analysis, based on optical to near-infrared data. After excluding possible contaminants, like brown dwarfs, little red dots, high-z (z>8.5) and ultra-high-z (z>15) galaxies, the sample mainly includes sources at z<1, with a tail extending up to z=7.2. The sample has a median stellar mass of $10^7$ Mo and a median dust attenuation of Av=2mag. We analysed the morphology, environment and star-formation rate of these sources to investigate the reason of their large dust attenuation. In particular, HELM sources have sizes (effective radii, Re) similar to non-dusty dwarf galaxies and no correlation is visible between the axis ratios (b/a) and the dust attenuation. This findings indicate that it is unlikely that the large dust attenuation is due to projection effects, but a prolate or a disk-on oblate geometry are still possible, at least for a subsample of the sources. We have found that the distribution of HELM sources is slightly skewed toward more clustered environments than non-dusty dwarfs and tend to be slightly less star forming. This finding, if confirmed by spectroscopic follow-up, indicates that HELM sources could be going through some environmental processes, such as galaxy interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 Collisional ring galaxies are a rare class of interacting systems, making up only ~0.01% of galaxies in the local Universe. Their formation is typically attributed to a head-on collision of a massive galaxy with a compact satellite (intruder), triggering density waves that, propagating outward, produce the characteristic ring morphology. Here, we present the discovery and detailed analysis of GS18660, the most distant ring galaxy known to date, at z=3.08, identified in JWST/NIRSpec IFS observations as part of the GA-NIFS programme. This work aims to characterise the physical and dynamical properties of GS18660 and shed light into the formation of its ring. Specifically, we analyse the ionized gas properties, stellar populations, and gas kinematics of the system, and use the observed geometry to constrain the timescale of the collision. Our analysis is based on NIRSpec IFS data, including low-resolution (R~100) spectroscopy covering ~0.2-1.3um rest-frame, and high-resolution (R~2700) spectroscopy covering 0.4-0.8um rest-frame. Multi-wavelength techniques are applied to derive nebular gas conditions and stellar population properties. Gas kinematic analysis reveals that GS18660 exhibits a rotating disk component with an additional radial expansion velocity of ~200 km/s, consistent with a propagating collisional wave. Nebular line diagnostics indicate intense star formation (SFR ~100 Msun/yr) along the ring and in the nucleus. Stellar population analysis shows that the most recent star formation episode, occurring within the last ~50 Myr, predominantly took place in the ring. We also identify a close companion, the intruder galaxy responsible for the collision, moving away with a relative velocity of ~425 km/s. The evidence strongly favours a collisional origin for the ring in GS18660, though the presence of a recently formed bar (and hence a resonance ring) cannot be completely excluded.

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift ($z > 3$), massive quiescent galaxies (QGs) offer a significant window into early Universe galaxy formation. Previous works have predicted miscellaneous properties for these quiescents, from an overdensity of neighbors to elevated quenched fractions among such neighbors (i.e. galactic conformity). However, due to a scarcity in highly-resolved deep-field observations until recently, these properties have not been closely examined and pose unresolved questions for galaxy evolution. With new photometric-redshift catalogs from JWST data in the COSMOS-Web field, we present the S$\mathrm{\hat{O}}$NG sample, comprising 171 photometrically selected massive ($\geq10^{10}$ M$_\odot$) QGs with $3\leq$ $z\mathrm{_{phot}}$ $<$ 5. We look for low-mass neighbors around our sample and find substantial populations of star-forming galaxies (SFGs), contrasting the conformity effect at low-$z$. Our QGs also exhibit diverse clustering, from having no neighbors to potentially residing in environments no denser than star-forming equivalents, to being accompanied by SFGs with more stellar mass than the QG itself. Using a geometric method, we also report filamentary signals for 4\% of our sample, suggestive of some QGs' rejuvenation via cold gas accretion. We reapply the analysis on seven spectroscopically confirmed QGs in COSMOS-Web (M$_*$ $\sim$ $10^9-10^{11}$ M$_\odot$) and note similar patterns. Lastly, we report on Saigon, the most distant low-mass quiescent galaxy known to date ($z =$ 4.55, M$_*$ $= 1.33 \times10^9$ M$_\odot$); this spectroscopically confirmed QG resides in a protocluster candidate with 11 SFGs. These results pave new paths towards understanding QG environment, while also signaling an opportune era to examine their evolution with JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical dichotomy in the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane is a consequence of the complex processes underlying the formation and evolution of disc galaxies such as observed in the stellar Milky Way disc. We determine what can drive an $\alpha$-bimodality of the disc in a zoom-in hydrodynamical simulated galaxy which has had no major mergers and negligible radial migration. Using a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the FIRE-2 suite of simulations, we analyse gas flows in the disc together with its star formation and merger history, as well as the chemical evolution of the hot corona, to investigate their connection to transitions in the chemo-dynamical structure of the stellar disc and its radial distribution. The simulated galaxy exhibits high and low-$\alpha$ sequences without having experienced major mergers nor significant radial migration. A high-$\alpha$ thick disc forms during the early chaotic clustering phase. Afterwards, as the star formation rate declines, a dip in the stellar number density appears, coinciding with the dilution of the galactic corona by a minor merger, which subsequently halts the rise of [Fe/H] in the disc. Later, accreted gas onto the disc from minor mergers, mildly enhances the star formation rate and generates the low-$\alpha$ sequence in the outer disc, with radial inward flows of this material feeding the low-$\alpha$ inner disc. Furthermore, we find that even at fixed radii, newly formed stars retain a sizable spread in their chemical abundances, reflecting chemical differences between the in-situ and the infalling gas from which they formed, further indicating that instantaneous gas mixing is invalid. Understanding the chemical evolution of stellar discs requires accounting for their accretion merger history and interaction with the surrounding hot corona, as well as the vertical and radial gas flows that redistribute metals within the disc.

 - **Abstract**
 Extended radio continuum emission and its linear polarization play a key role in probing large-scale structures of synchrotron and free-free emission in the Milky Way. Despite the existence of many radio continuum surveys, sensitive and high-angular-resolution single-dish surveys of extended radio continuum emission remain scarce. As part of the GLObal view of STAR formation (GLOSTAR) survey, we will also crucially complement the existing data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) by addressing the missing zero-spacing gap. Within the framework of the GLOSTAR Galactic plane survey, we performed large-scale radio continuum imaging observations toward the Galactic plane in the range $-2^{\circ}< \ell <60^{\circ}$ and $|b|<1.1^{\circ}$, as well as the Cygnus X region with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope. We present the Effelsberg continuum survey at 4.89GHz and 6.82GHz including linear polarization with angular resolutions of 145$^{\prime\prime}$ and 106$^{\prime\prime}$, respectively. The survey has been corrected for missing large-scale emission using available low-angular-resolution surveys. Comparison with previous single-dish surveys indicates that our continuum survey represents the highest-quality single-dish data collected to date at this frequency. More than 90\% of the flux density missed by the VLA D-array data is effectively recovered by the Effelsberg continuum survey. The improved sensitivity and angular resolution of our survey enable reliable mapping of Galactic magnetic field structures, with polarization data that are less affected by depolarization than in previous surveys. The GLOSTAR single-dish continuum data will be released publicly, offering a valuable resource for studying extended objects including HII regions, supernova remnants, diffuse interstellar medium, and Galactic structure.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a framework that links equatorial-current-sheet (ECS) physics to catalog-lelvel phase-averaged gamma-ray pulsar properties. Guided by analytic scalings and 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we show that the pulsar "Fundamental Plane" (relating gamma-ray luminosity, spectral cutoff energy, spin-down power $\dot{\cal{E}}$, and surface magnetic field) is bounded by two regimes: a radiation-reaction-limited branch and a potential-drop-limited branch. Their intersection defines a transition in $\dot{\cal{E}}$ that maps to a gamma-ray visibility threshold on the $P-\dot{P}$ diagram, above which detectability is set by distance and beaming, and below which both cutoff energy and efficiency decline rapidly. Placing ATNF pulsars and McGill magnetars onto these planes reproduces the observed Fermi occupancy, with millisecond pulsars (MSPs) on the observable side, young pulsars (YPs) straddling the threshold, and magnetars clustering at or just below it. At higher $\dot{\cal{E}}$, both MSPs and YPs depart from the maximal radiation-reaction-limited envelope at similar cutoff energies, suggesting that enhanced pair creation screens the accelerating electric field in the ECS. We interpret this behavior with a compactness-based criterion for optically thin $\gamma\gamma$ pair feedback in or near the ECS and briefly note an extension to $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow\mu^\pm$ that could yield pulsed multi-TeV neutrinos in the most energetic systems. The framework predicts an MeV-bright, GeV-faint corridor below current Fermi sensitivity, a target for next-generation MeV missions. Finally, motivated by the recent HESSII detection of pulsed multi-TeV emission from Vela, we use PIC particle distributions with a simple seed-photon model to reproduce a multi-TeV inverse-Compton component alongside the GeV curvature emission, supporting a unified ECS-based GeV-TeV origin.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST offers an unprecedented view of optically dark or faint galaxies (OFGs), previously missed by HST. They are likely massive, heavily dust-obscured star-forming galaxies (SFGs) that substantially contribute to the cosmic SFR density at z > 3. To identify drivers of their high dust attenuation and their role in early universe galaxy evolution, we analyse the stellar morphology of 65 OFGs (from 1892 SFGs at 3<z<4) using NIRCAM/F444W imaging from the PRIMER and CEERS fields. We study correlations between dust attenuation ($A_{v}$) and galaxy properties, like stellar mass, size, and orientation, and compare scaling relations between OFGs and typical SFGs. We find that OFGs are ~8-9 times more massive and ~4 times more dust attenuated than the parent sample. Structurally, OFGs resemble parent SFGs in median $R_e$ and median $\Sigma_{R_e}$ but may be slightly rounder on average. While $A_v$ strongly correlates with stellar mass, it does not show significant dependence on stellar mass-normalised effective radius and stellar mass surface density, Sérsic index, axis ratio, or SFR surface density. The mass-size and mass-surface density relations place OFGs as a higher-mass extension of SFGs, with no concrete proof of evolutionary differences between them. This suggests that OFGs are heavily dust-obscured primarily due to their high stellar masses, which facilitates dust production and retention, with older stellar populations likely contributing as well. Although some OFGs exhibit high $\Sigma_\mathrm{R_e}$ and occupy regions of the mass-size plane similar to quiescent galaxies, the overall sample is not representative of this. Their current structures resemble typical SFGs, with no concrete signs of rapid compaction. Diversity in their physical properties shows that OFGs span a range of evolutionary states with few showing reduced star formation, while most remain actively star-forming.

 - **Abstract**
 Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to occur in star-forming regions. The multiwavelength follow-up observations of the early afterglow of GRB 240825A provided insights into the evolution of the optical-to-X-ray spectral feature of the afterglow. We comprehensively investigate the evolution of X-ray spectral properties through time-resolved spectral analysis and calculate optical darkness ($\beta_\mathrm{OX}$) to reveal the physical properties of the afterglow. The X-ray-to-optical SEDs of afterglow in different time intervals are fitted to derive the extinction curves. The $\beta_\mathrm{OX}$ exhibits a trend of decreasing and then increasing, reaching its minimum value at $\sim1000\mathrm{\,s}$ post-trigger. However, at 11 hours post-trigger, $\beta_\mathrm{OX}$ does not meet the criteria for an optically dark burst. The extinction curves in different time intervals indicate that GRB 240825A occurred in a dust-obscured environment.

 - **Abstract**
 The polarization of light is a critically under-utilized, rich source of information in astronomy. For stars in particular, surface magnetism polarization that can be detected and measured with spectro-polarimetry. Many questions about these surface fields remain unanswered due to a lack of dedicated instruments capable of probing weak and strong surface magnetic fields for the entire mass range of stars, from M-dwarfs (and even substellar objects) to massive O-type stars at different evolutionary stages and metallicities. These questions range from the origin of these fields to their true incidence rate throughout the stellar population and the dependence on metallicity. Magnetic fields, although currently often excluded from stellar evolution models, play an important role in stellar evolution. Connecting the surface fields to internal fields through asteroseismology will instigate a new era of understanding stellar evolution and the transport of angular momentum and chemical elements throughout stellar interiors, also impacting our understanding of star-planet interactions and stellar remnants. Polarimetry is also an under-utilized tool to observationally constrain the mode identification of nonradial oscillations, which lies at the basis of accurate asteroseismic parameter estimation at percentage-level for stellar radii, masses, ages, internal rotation, and magnetic field strengths. Combining strong constraints on mode identification and surface magnetic properties through the acquisition of time-resolved, high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise (S/N) spectro-polarimetry and spectroscopy promises to bring leaps forward in our understanding of stellar structure, particularly when combined with long-term space photometric data from past, current, and future missions.

 - **Abstract**
 By the 2040s, several all-sky surveys will have transformed our view of the large-scale structure. However, one of the major outstanding questions in astrophysics will remain: understanding how galaxies acquire and evolve their angular momentum and how this connects to the cosmic web. Measuring the alignments between galaxy spins and cosmic filaments across cosmic time, and understanding what this reveals about galaxy evolution, requires surveys that also characterise intrinsic alignments, i.e. correlations in galaxy shapes produced by the cosmic web itself rather than by lensing. Intrinsic alignments are a major source of systematic error in weak-lensing measurements of the fundamental parameters of the Universe. Addressing both questions together will necessitate new types of MOS surveys that combine kinematic information with high-completeness redshifts down to at least 24-25mag. To achieve our science goals, we require a new generation of wide-field spectroscopic facilities that can obtain spin-filament alignment measurements for millions of galaxies while simultaneously delivering sub-Mpc resolution of the cosmic web and spatially-resolved kinematics required to map the spin-filament connection at the level of individual galaxies within their local cosmic environment. Such a program would provide a unique legacy survey of galaxies and cosmic structures from kiloparsec to megaparsec scales, establishing ESO's leadership in bridging the physics of galaxy evolution with the systematic-control requirements for Stage-IV cosmological surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of stellar space weather and can strongly influence the habitability of exoplanets. However, compared to the frequent occurrence of white-light flares, confirmed stellar CMEs remain extremely rare. Whether such flares are commonly accompanied by CMEs is a key question for solar-stellar comparative studies. Using Sun-as-a-star soft X-ray flare light curves observed by the GOES XRS 1--8~Å channel, we compiled a sample of 1,766 M-class and larger solar flares and extracted features with both deep convolutional neural networks and manual methods. Five machine-learning classifiers were trained to distinguish eruptive from confined flares, with the random forest model achieving the best performance (true skill statistic; TSS = 0.31). This TSS value indicates that the model possesses a moderate ability to discriminate between eruptive and confined flares. Normalized white-light and GOES XRS flare light curves show broadly consistent temporal evolution, reflecting their shared energy-release history and supporting a probabilistic transfer of the model to white-light flare data. We applied the best-performing RF model to 41,405 TESS-detected flares on FGKM-type main-sequence stars, predicting that approximately 47% of events show CME-like morphological characteristics, with the model-implied intrinsic association fraction lying in the range 35%--60%. Intriguingly, the CME occurrence rate decreases with increasing flare energy, indicating that the most energetic flares may be more strongly confined by overlying magnetic fields. These results provide new insight into flare-CME connections in diverse stellar environments and have important implications for assessing the impact of stellar eruptive activity on exoplanetary atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Mass-loss from massive stars is fundamental to stellar and galactic evolution and enrichment of the interstellar medium. Reliable determination of mass-loss rate is dependent upon unravelling details of massive star outflows, including optical depth structure of the stellar wind. That parameter introduces significant uncertainty due to the nearly ubiquitous presence of large-scale optically thick wind structure. We utilize suitable available ultraviolet spectra of 20 Large and Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC, SMC) OB stars to extend existing Galactic results quantifying uncertainty inherent in individual observations to lower metallicity environments. This is achieved by measuring standard deviations of mean optical depths of multiple observations of suitable wind-formed absorption profiles as a proportion of their mean optical depths. We confirm earlier findings that wind structure is prevalent at low metallicities and demonstrate that quantifying the consequent uncertainty is to some extent possible, despite the near-complete absence of time series UV spectroscopic observations in those environments. We find that the uncertainty inherent in any single observation of stellar wind optical depth at low metallicity is of similar magnitude to that already identified at Galactic metallicity (up to 45% for cooler OB stars). We further demonstrate how the effect of varying narrow absorption components in wind-formed UV spectral profiles is unlikely to be properly accounted for in existing mass-loss models. We present further evidence of a binary companion to the SMC O-type giant star AzV 75. The importance of obtaining high cadence multi-epoch, or genuine time series, UV spectroscopic observations at low metallicities is highlighted.

 - **Abstract**
 The environment plays an important role in shaping the evolution of cluster galaxies through mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping (RPS), whose effect may be enhanced in merging clusters. We investigate a complex of three galaxies UGC 6697, CGCG 097-073 and CGCG 097-079, that are currently undergoing extreme RPS, as evident from their multi-wavelength-detected tails. The galaxies are members of the nearby ($d=92$ Mpc) merging cluster Abell 1367 and are located in proximity to an intracluster medium (ICM) shock that is traced by X-ray observations and the presence of a radio relic. We analyze LOFAR and MeerKAT observations at frequencies of 54, 144, 817 and 1270 MHz to perform a detailed spectral analysis of the tails. We find that all three tails are significantly more extended than in previous radio studies, with lengths $\geq70$ kpc. For UGC 6697, we detected a tail of 300 kpc, making it the longest known RPS tail of a star-forming galaxy at any wavelength. The length and spectral variations of the tail cannot be explained purely by the spectral aging of stripped cosmic rays. We construct a model of the tail that includes compression and re-acceleration due to the encounter with the nearby ICM shock, which can plausibly account for the extreme RPS as well as the length and spectral variation of the tail. We further discover a radio plume at the leading edge of UGC 6697 that connects to a narrow filament. These sources exhibit extremely steep ($\alpha\approx-1.7$) and highly curved spectra. We speculate that this emission arises from cosmic rays re-energized by UGC 6697's rapid infall which propagate along magnetic filaments in the cluster center. Our findings represent direct evidence of a cluster merger shock impacting the evolution of member galaxies. Furthermore, we report the first tentative detection of particle acceleration at the leading edge of an infalling galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 As stars traverse the Milky Way, their orbits evolve through perturbations that alter their orbital radii. These changes arise from two mechanisms: churning, which modifies angular momentum, and blurring, which induces eccentric orbits without major angular momentum change. To assess whether churning or blurring dominates the dynamical evolution of Gaia-ESO stars, we refine Galactic chemical-evolution models by constructing finer grids that span a wider age range. Using a generalised additive model (GAM), we estimate stellar birth radii beyond the limits of binned metallicity models and compare them with dynamical parameters derived from Gaia parallaxes and proper motions, and Galpy. Our metallicity-stratified sample, grouped through hierarchical clustering of 21 chemical abundances, reveals clear migratory signatures: metal-rich stars formed in the inner disc preferentially move outwards, while more metal-poor stars formed at larger radii tend to migrate inwards. About 75% of stars show signs of churning, while the remainder are largely undisturbed or shaped by blurring. These patterns vary among chemical groups, likely reflecting interactions with the Galactic bar and spiral arms.

 Sprawling, turbulent cloud formations dominate the meteorology of Jupiter's mid-to-high latitudes, known as Folded Filamentary Regions (FFRs). A multi-wavelength characterisation by Juno reveals the spatial distribution, vertical structure, and energetics of the FFRs. The cloud tops display multiple lobes of stratiform aerosols, separated by darker, cloud-free lanes, and embedded with smaller eddies and high-altitude cumulus clouds. These cyclonic FFRs are microwave-bright in shallow-sounding wavelengths ($p<5$ bars) and microwave-dark in deep-sounding wavelengths ($p>10$ bars), with the transition potentially associated with the water condensation layer (6-7 bars). Associating microwave contrasts with temperature anomalies, this implies despinning of cyclonic eddies above/below their mid-planes. Despite deep roots (being detectable in wavelengths sounding $\sim100$ bars), they are ``pancake vortices'' with horizontal extents at least an order of magnitude larger than their depth. In the northern hemisphere, FFRs are most common in cyclonic belts poleward of $40^\circ$N (all latitudes are planetocentric), particularly a North Polar Filamentary Belt (NPFB) near $66-70^\circ$N that defines the transition from organised belts/zones to the chaotic polar domain. This distribution explains the high lightning rates from $45-80^\circ$N, peaking in a belt poleward of $52.3^\circ$N, which may trace the availability of water for moist convection. Many observed lightning flashes can be associated to specific FFRs containing bright storms, but some FFRs display no activity, suggesting quiescent periods during storm evolution. Analogies to Earth's oceanic eddies suggest that cyclones deform isentropic surfaces at their midplanes, raising deep water-rich layers upwards to promote moist convection, release latent heat, and inject clouds into the upper troposphere.
