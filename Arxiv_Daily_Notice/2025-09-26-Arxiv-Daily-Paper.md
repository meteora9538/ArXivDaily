 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents UNAGI, a novel spacecraft mission developed by Spartan Space Systems, a student engineering team at San Jose State University, aiming for the first controlled landing on Jupiter's volcanically active moon Io. Inspired by the Japanese freshwater eel's agility, UNAGI employs an electrodynamic tether system that interacts with Jupiter's magnetic field to generate Lorentz forces, enabling dynamic modulation of the spacecraft's velocity without the need for traditional propellant. This system allows the spacecraft to precisely match Io's orbital velocity, similar to a surfer riding a wave. By optimizing tether current and orientation, UNAGI transitions from an outer Jovian insertion orbit to an orbit around Io, achieving a controlled landing for on-surface science operations. The landing is strategically timed, leveraging the gravitational influence of Jupiter and its moons to decelerate descent and mitigate impact forces. UNAGI leverages technologies from missions like Juno, JUICE, and Europa Clipper to ensure reliable operation in the challenging Jovian environment. The mission follows a phased approach, including cruise, orbital insertion, tether deployment, Jovian orbital operations, and final descent, with extensive risk mitigation through simulations and experimental validation. The concept supports rideshare integration on future NASA or ESA missions or a dedicated launch, emphasizing cost effectiveness and adaptability. UNAGI carries a scientific payload including infrared spectrometers, magnetometers, seismometers, and chromatographs, designed to probe Io's interior dynamics, volcanic activity, tectonic deformation, and magnetospheric interactions. This mission aims to advance understanding of Io's geophysical processes and Jupiter system dynamics, setting a new standard for deep space exploration of extreme environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We study star formation over 12 Gyr using pop-cosmos, a generative model trained on 26-band photometry of 420,000 COSMOS2020 galaxies (IRAC Ch.1 $<26$). The model learns distributions over 16 SPS parameters via score-based diffusion, matching observed colours and magnitudes. We compute the star formation rate density (SFRD) to $z=3.5$ by directly integrating individual galaxy SFRs. The SFRD peaks at $z=1.3\pm0.1$, with peak value $0.08\pm0.01$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. We classify star-forming (SF) and quiescent (Q) galaxies using specific SFR $<10^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparing with $NUVrJ$ colour selection. The sSFR criterion yields up to 20% smaller quiescent fractions across $0<z<3.5$, with $NUVrJ$-selected samples contaminated by galaxies with sSFR up to $10^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our sSFR-selected stellar mass function shows a negligible number density of low-mass ($<10^{9.5}$ M$_\odot$) Q galaxies at $z\sim1$, where colour-selection shows a prominent increase. Non-parametric star formation histories around the SFRD peak reveal distinct patterns: SF galaxies show gradually decreasing SFR correlations with lookback time ($r\sim1$ to $r\sim0$ over 13 Gyr), implying increasingly stochastic star formation toward early epochs. Q galaxies exhibit full correlation ($r>0.95$) during the most recent $\sim$300 Myr, then sharp decorrelation with earlier star-forming epochs, marking clear quenching transitions. Massive ($10<\log_{10}(M_*/$M$_{\odot})<11$) galaxies quench on a time-scale of $\sim1$ Gyr, with mass assembly concentrated in their first 3.5 Gyr. Finally, AGN activity (infrared luminosity) peaks as massive ($\sim10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$) galaxies approach the transition between star-forming and quiescent states, declining sharply once quiescence is established. This provides evidence that AGN feedback operates in a critical regime during the $\sim1$ Gyr quenching transition.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the most precise and lowest-mass weak lensing measurements of dwarf galaxies to date, enabled by spectroscopic lenses from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and photometric lenses from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) calibrated with DESI redshifts. Using DESI spectroscopy from the first data release, we construct clean samples of galaxies with median stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.3-10.1$ and measure their weak lensing signals with sources from DES, KiDS, and SDSS, achieving detections with $S/N$ up to 14 for dwarf galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})<$9.25) -- opening up a new regime for lensing measurements of low-mass systems. Leveraging DES photometry calibrated with DESI, we extend to a photometric dwarf sample of over 700,000 galaxies, enabling robust lensing detections of dwarf galaxies with combined $S/N=38$ and a significant measurement down to $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.0$. We show that the one-halo regime (scales $\lesssim 0.15h^{-1}\rm Mpc$) is insensitive to various systematic and sample selection effects, providing robust halo mass estimates, while the signal in the two-halo regime depends on galaxy color and environment. These results demonstrate that DESI already enables precise dwarf lensing measurements, and that calibrated photometric samples extend this capability. Together, they pave the way for novel constraints on dwarf galaxy formation and dark matter physics with upcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST.

 - **Abstract**
 Metals enhance the cooling efficiency of molecular clouds, promoting fragmentation. Consequently, increasing the metallicity may boost the formation of low-mass stars. Within the integrated galaxy initial mass function (IGIMF) theory, this effect is empirically captured by a linear relation between the slope of the low-mass stellar IMF, $\alpha_1$, and the metal mass fraction, $Z$. This linear $\alpha_1$-$Z$ relation has been calibrated up to $\approx 2 \, Z_{\odot}$, though higher metallicity environments are known to exist. We show that if the linear $\alpha_1$-$Z$ relation extends to higher metallicities ($[Z] \gtrsim 0.5$), massive star formation is suppressed entirely. Alternatively, fragmentation efficiency may saturate beyond some metallicity threshold if gravitational collapse cascades rapidly enough. To model this behavior, we propose a logistic function describing the transition from metallicity-sensitive to metallicity-insensitive fragmentation regimes. We provide a user-friendly public code, pyIGIMF, which enables the instantaneous computation of the IGIMF theory with the logistic $\alpha_1$-$Z$ relation.
#### SAGAbg III: Environmental Stellar Mass Functions, Self-Quenching, and the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation in the Dwarf Galaxy Regime

 - **Abstract**
 Recent efforts have extended our view of the number and properties of satellite galaxies beyond the Local Group firmly down to $\rm M_\star\sim 10^6 M_\odot$. A similarly complete view of the field dwarf population has lagged behind. Using the background galaxies sample from the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey at $z<0.05$, we take inventory of the dwarf population down to $\rm M_\star \sim 5\times10^6 M_\odot$ using three metrics: the stellar mass function (SMF) as function of environment, the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) of dwarf galaxies inferred via abundance matching, and the quenched fraction of highly isolated dwarfs. We find that the low-mass SMF shape shows minimal environmental dependence, with the field dwarf SMF described by a low-mass power-law index of $\alpha_1=-1.44\pm0.09$ down to $\rm M_\star \sim 5\times10^6 M_\odot$, and that the quenched fraction of isolated dwarfs drops monotonically to $f_{q} \sim 10^{-3}$ at $\rm M_\star \sim \rm 10^{8.5} M_\odot$. Though slightly steeper than estimates from \HI{} kinematic measures, our inferred SHMR agrees with literature measurements of satellite systems, consistent with minimal environmental dependence of the SHMR in the probed mass range. Finally, although most contemporary cosmological simulations against which we compare accurately predict the \sagalocal{} SHMR, we find that big-box cosmological simulations largely over-predict isolated galaxy quenched fractions via a turnaround in $f_q(\rm M_\star)$ at $\rm 10^8\lesssim M_\star/M_\odot\lesssim 10^9$, underscoring the complexities in disentangling the drivers of galaxy formation and the need for systematic multidimensional observations of the dwarf population across environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present measurements of stellar population properties of a newly discovered spectroscopically confirmed $z=11.10^{+0.11}_{-0.26}$, gravitationally lensed galaxy, using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy and NIRCam imaging. The arc is highly magnified by the Bullet Cluster (magnification factor ${\mu}=14.0^{+6.2}_{-0.3}$. It contains three star-forming components of which one is barely resolved and two are unresolved, giving intrinsic sizes of $\lesssim 10pc$. The clumps also contain ~50% of the total stellar mass. The galaxy formed the majority of its stars ~150Myr ago (by z~14). The spectrum shows a pronounced damping wing, typical for galaxies deep in the reionisation era and indicating a neutral IGM at this line of sight. The intrinsic luminosity of the galaxy is $0.086^{+0.008}_{-0.030} L^*$ (with $L^*$ being the characteristic luminosity for this redshift), making it the lowest luminosity spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at $z>10$ discovered to date.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysics, appearing in diverse environments from planet-forming systems to X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. Traditionally, modeling their dynamics requires computationally intensive (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations. Recently, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising alternative. This approach trains neural networks directly on physical laws without requiring data. We for the first time demonstrate PINNs for solving the two-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamics of non-self-gravitating accretion disks. Our models provide solutions at arbitrary times and locations within the training domain, and successfully reproduce key physical phenomena, including the excitation and propagation of spiral density waves and gap formation from disk-companion interactions. Notably, the boundary-free approach enabled by PINNs naturally eliminates the spurious wave reflections at disk edges, which are challenging to suppress in numerical simulations. These results highlight how advanced machine learning techniques can enable physics-driven, data-free modeling of complex astrophysical systems, potentially offering an alternative to traditional numerical simulations in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 The ring and gap structures found in observed protoplanetary disks are often attributed to embedded gap-opening planets and typically modeled with simplified thermodynamics in the 2D, thin disk approximation. However, it has been shown that radiative cooling and meridional processes play key roles in planet-disk interaction, though their computational cost has limited their exploration. We investigate the differences between 2D and 3D models of gap-opening planets while also comparing thermodynamical frameworks ranging from locally isothermal to fully radiative. We also compare simplified cooling recipes to fully radiative models in an effort to motivate the inclusion of radiative effects in future modeling even in a parametrized manner. We perform hydrodynamical simulations in both 2D and 3D, and then compare the angular momentum deposition by planetary spirals to assess gap opening efficiency. We repeat comparisons with different thermodynamical treatments: locally isothermal, adiabatic, local $\beta$ cooling, and fully radiative including radiative diffusion. We find that 2D models are able to capture the essential physics of gap opening with remarkable accuracy, even when including full radiation transport in both cases. Simple cooling prescriptions can capture the trends found in fully radiative models, albeit slightly overestimating gap opening efficiency near the planet. Inherently 3D effects such as vertical flows that cannot be captured in 2D can explain the differences between the two approaches, but do not impact gap opening significantly. Our findings encourage the use of models that include radiative processes in the study of planet-disk interaction, even with simplified yet physically motivated cooling prescriptions in lieu of full radiation transport. This is particularly important in the context of substructure-inducing planets in the ALMA-sensitive disk regions (>10 au).

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields in pre main sequence stars regulate angular momentum evolution, drive magnetic activity, and modify stellar structure, yet their surface distributions remain poorly constrained. Traditional single component Zeeman broadening analyses typically yield mean field strengths of 2-4 kG, sometimes exceeding the photospheric equipartition limit, and assume complete magnetic coverage. These assumptions conflict with evidence that strong fields are concentrated in cool starspots. Here we present the first systematic separation of photospheric and starspot magnetic field strengths in PMS stars, using high resolution R=45000 H and K band spectra from the Raw and Reduced IGRINS Archive. By modeling temperature and magnetic field strength simultaneously for a vetted sample of 33 Class II-III young stellar objects, we find median photospheric field strengths of 1.2 kG and median spot field strengths over two times stronger at 2.56 kG, resolving the apparent super equipartition tension and removing the need for a unity magnetic filling factor. Our results show that PMS surfaces are permeated by concentrated, kG strength spot fields covering 27-83% of the visible hemisphere. This two component framework offers a physically motivated means to reconcile spectroscopic and imaging based magnetic diagnostics and enables large scale magnetic population studies across young clusters and star forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The scope of this literature review is observations of the products of first-stage evolution for binaries having components with M < 2 $M_\odot$. A taxonomy for these products comprises dwarfs ("blue stragglers"), giants ("yellow stragglers"), subdwarf B stars, and giant-like stars ("sub-subgiants" and "red stragglers"). This literature review is organized according to this taxonomy within three distinct environments: open star clusters, globular star clusters, and the Galactic field. This literature review is the Supplemental Material for Blue Stragglers and Friends: Initial Evolutionary Pathways in Close Low-Mass Binaries (Mathieu & Pols, 2025, ARAA, 63:467-512, doi: this http URL). It is intended to support and expand on Section 3 of the main text of this Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, where an integrated perspective on the common and contrasting astrophysical properties of these binary evolution products is provided. Figures used in the main text to highlight key observational results are referenced in this literature review. The closing date of this review is January 17, 2025, with some citations subsequently updated.

 - **Abstract**
 Contamination-free assessments of the interstellar medium and star formation in quasar host galaxies, particularly based on the far-infrared, offer insights into the role of supermassive black holes in galaxy evolution. Motivated by predictions of quasar heating of dust on both nuclear and galaxy-wide scales, we perform two-component (host galaxy + point source) modeling of high-resolution (~0.1") ALMA observations of the FIR continuum in Band 5 (lambda_rest~500 um) of three highly luminous quasars (L_bol~10^47 erg/s), powered by supermassive black holes having M_BH~10^9 M_sun, at z=2. We include Band 9 (lambda_rest~154 um; 0.06" and 0.3") data at high S/N which places further constraints on the unresolved nuclear component in two cases. To break the degeneracy between quasar and stellar heating, we use CO (J=5-4), observed in Band 5, to gauge the expected contribution of star formation to the infrared luminosity. We find very good agreement between the strength and spatial distribution of the extended continuum component and its prediction based on CO (J=5-4). This is supported by the location of our three quasars along the L_(CO 5-4)-L_(IR, SFR) luminosity relation for inactive star-forming galaxies. As a consequence, there is no evidence for additional continuum emission on extended scales which could be attributed to quasar-heated dust. As expected, the nuclear (i.e., torus) contribution is present and subdominant (12% in Band 9 for one quasar with a typical star-forming host) or non-existent (<8% in Band 9 for the starbursting host). Based on the continuum and CO, the presence of substantial levels of ongoing star formation agrees with previous estimates from unresolved ALMA continuum observations which finds SFRs consistent with star-forming main-sequence galaxies. Therefore, our results do not provide evidence for a quasar-mode feedback, even for the most luminous cases at z=2.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars regulate galaxy evolution and star formation through their powerful physical and chemical feedback, but their formation remains poorly understood. Accretion powered outflows can provide important diagnostics of massive star formation. We present first results from the SOMA Atomic Outflow Survey, a far-infrared massive star formation survey using the FIFI-LS spectrometer on SOFIA. We report detection of [OIII] $^3P_2\rightarrow^3P_1$ emission at 52 $\mu$m from the massive protostar G11.94-0.62, tracing highly ionized gas. We also detect [OI] $^3P_2\rightarrow^3P_1$ and $^3P_1\rightarrow^3P_0$ at 63 and 145 $\mu$m tracing atomic gas, as well as CO $J=14\rightarrow13$ at 186 $\mu$m from highly excited molecular gas. The [OIII] and [OI] lines exhibit large line widths ($\sim400$ and $\sim40-80$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively) and their morphologies are consistent with a wide-angle bipolar outflow. Molecular tracers ($^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH) observed with ALMA also suggest a self-consistent outflow morphology. Ionized nebula/PDR modeling imply an ionized outflow mass flux of $\sim8\times10^{-5}\:M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and an atomic outflow mass flux of $\sim5\times10^{-6}\:M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, while the molecular outflow traced by CO has an implied mass flux of $\sim3\times10^{-4}\:M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The mass and momentum flux in the ionized outflow is consistent with the main component of the primary disk wind, while the molecular component is mainly swept-up, secondary outflow gas. We also observe G11.94-0.62 with the LBT in the near-infrared, potentially tracing the base of wide-angle outflow cavities. SED modeling implies $m_\star = 22.4^{+21}_{-11}\:M_\odot$, while the [OIII] emission implies $m_*\gtrsim30\:M_\odot$ and that the protostar is in the final stages of its accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery and timing of two pulsars from a sample of four circularly polarized sources identified in radio continuum images taken as part of the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) survey. Observations with the Parkes (Murriyang) radio telescope confirmed both sources as normal pulsars with high dispersion measures. PSR J1646$-$4451 has a spin period of 217 ms and a dispersion measure (DM) of 928 $\rm cm^{-3} \, pc$, while PSR J1837$-$0616 exhibits a spin period of 118 ms and a DM of 793 $\rm cm^{-3} \, pc$. These pulsars show extreme pulse broadening due to scattering, with measured scattering timescales of 290 ms and 343 ms at observing frequencies of 1.8 GHz and 1.9 GHz, respectively. These measurements imply extrapolated scattering timescales at 1 GHz of 2479 ms and 2154 ms, placing them among the most heavily scattered pulsars known to date. Our findings underscore the potential of using circular polarization in radio continuum images as a tool for identifying highly scattered pulsars. Future wide-field radio continuum surveys are poised to uncover a broader population of extreme pulsars particularly those that are heavily scattered at 1.4 GHz, intrinsically faint, or residing in binaries$-$offering valuable insights into both pulsar demographics and the complex structure of the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the follow-up observations of circularly polarized sources identified in the MeerKAT image-based survey of the Galactic bulge. Using the Parkes radio telescope, we observed sixteen circularly polarized sources with the UWL receiver and detected nine pulsars among which six of them are new discoveries. All pulsars are fast rotators with spin periods under 100\,ms. Among the new discoveries five are millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and one has a spin period of 55\,ms. At least four new MSPs exhibit clear signs of binary motion in their discovery observations. The dispersion measures (DMs) of these pulsars fall between 18 and 330\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$, which is lower than expected for Galactic bulge members and indicates that these pulsars lie in the foreground along the line of sight rather than within the bulge itself. This is the first time such a large number of pulsars have been confirmed via an image-based survey. These discoveries underscore the exceptional efficacy of circular polarization selection in image-based pulsar surveys, and demonstrate the powerful synergy between high-sensitivity imaging and targeted time-domain follow-up using wide-band receivers and strengthen prospects for future deep pulsation searches$-$e.g., with MeerKAT or the forthcoming SKA or DSA-2000$-$to uncover the true millisecond pulsar population in the Galactic bulge.

 Understanding the orbits of giant planets is critical for testing planet formation models, particularly at wide separations greater than 10 au where traditional core accretion becomes inefficient. However, constraining orbits at these separations has been challenging because of sparse orbital coverage and degeneracies in the orbital parameters. We use existing high-resolution spectroscopic measurements from CRIRES+ (R ~ 100000), astrometric data from SPHERE, NACO, and ALMA, and new high-precision GRAVITY astrometry to refine the orbit of GQ Lup B, a ~30 M_J companion at ~100 au, in a system that also hosts a circumstellar disk and a wide companion, GQ Lup C. Including radial velocity data significantly improves orbital constraints by breaking the degeneracy between inclination and eccentricity that affects astrometry-only fits for long-period companions. This work is among the first to combine high-precision astrometry with the companion's relative radial velocity to achieve improved orbital constraints. The eccentricity is refined from e = 0.47 (+0.14, -0.16) with GRAVITY alone to e = 0.35 (+0.10, -0.09) when RVs and GRAVITY data are combined. The orbit is misaligned by 63 (+6, -14) deg relative to the circumstellar disk and 52 (+19, -24) deg relative to the host star spin axis, and is more consistent (34 (+6, -13) deg) with the inclination of the wide tertiary companion GQ Lup C disk. These results support a formation scenario for GQ Lup B consistent with cloud fragmentation and highlight the power of combining companion RV constraints with interferometric astrometry to probe the dynamics and formation of wide-orbit substellar companions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a physically interpretable framework to quantify dynamical disturbances in galaxy clusters using projected two-dimensional phase-space information. Based on the TNG-Cluster simulation, we construct a disturbance score that captures merger-driven asymmetries through features such as velocity dispersion and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) peak fitting, which captures asymmetries indicative of dynamical disturbance. All features are derived from observable quantities and are intended to be measurable in future surveys. To enable observational application, we adopt a simplified estimator using aperture mass map statistics as a mass ratio proxy in TNG300-1, and validate its performance with weak lensing data from The Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS). While phase-space diagnostics reveal merger-driven asymmetries, they are not sensitive to whether the secondary progenitor is infalling or receding, and thus cannot distinguish future mergers from past mergers. To address this, we incorporate the star formation rate (SFR) from TNG-Cluster and propose the blue galaxy fraction as a promising observational tracer of merger timing. Finally, we construct mock Chandra X-ray images of TNG-Cluster halos at redshift $z=0.2$, and find that the offset between the X-ray peak and the position of the most massive black hole (used as a proxy for the Brightest Cluster Galaxy, BCG) correlates with our disturbance score, serving as a consistency check. We also perform case studies using LoVoCCS observational data, correlating the blue galaxy fraction with disturbance scores derived from the eROSITA morphology catalog.

 - **Abstract**
 Collisionless dissipation of turbulence is important for heating plasmas in astrophysical, space physics, and laboratory environments, controlling energy, momentum and particle transport. We analyze Parker Solar Probe observations to understand the collisionless heating of the sub-Alfvénic solar wind, which is connected to the solar corona. Our results show that linear resonant heating through parallel-propagating cyclotron waves cannot account for turbulent dissipation in sub-Alfvénic region, which observations suggest may dissipate turbulence at distances further from the Sun. Instead, we find that stochastic heating can account for the observed ion energization; however, because the dominant contributions arise from infrequent, large-amplitude events, turbulent intermittency must be explicitly incorporated. These observations directly connect stochastic heating via breaking of the proton magnetic moment with the intermittent and inhomogeneous heating of turbulence reported in many previous studies. Our identification of stochastic heating as a dynamic mechanism responsible for intermittent heating of the solar wind has significant implications for turbulent dissipation in the lower corona, other astrophysical environments, and laboratory plasma.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers funnel gas toward the nuclei, igniting starbursts and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The AGN feedback can reshape the host galaxy and regulate both star formation and super-massive black-hole (SMBH) accretion. Using VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy, we conduct a spatially resolved study of the triple-AGN candidate SDSS J0849+1114. Extended ionized gas structures ($>10$ kpc from nucleus A) primarily associated with tidal tails are detected. Meanwhile, two distinct ionized gas outflows are revealed. One extends over $>5$ kpc around nuclei A with a kinetic power of $\dot{E}_{\rm out,A} = 3.0\times10^{42}\rm\, erg\, s^{-1}$, which might be driven by the radio jet. The other outflow extends $\sim 5.9$ kpc around nucleus C, with a kinetic power of $\dot{E}_{\rm out,C} = 2.0\times10^{40}\rm\, erg\, s^{-1}$. High [O III]/H$\alpha$ and [N II]/H$\alpha$ ratios in the tidal gas require that nucleus A radiated at a high accretion rate with $L_{\rm A,bol} \sim 0.1$--$0.5\,L_{\rm Edd,A}$ at least $\sim3$--$\times10^{4}\rm\,yr$ ago, $20$--$100$ times brighter than today. Combined with multi-wavelength constraints, we find evidence for episodic AGN feedback that expelled circumnuclear gas and rapidly quenched accretion. This triple AGN candidate demonstrates how AGN feedback can self-regulate black hole growth and impact hosts during mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 Generally, merger likelihood increases in denser environments; however, the large relative velocities at the centres of dense clusters are expected to reduce the likelihood of mergers for satellite galaxies. Tidal features probe the recent merger histories of galaxies. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will produce an unprecedented sample of tidal features around millions of galaxies. We use LSST-like mock observations of galaxies at $z\sim0$ from the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG and Magneticum Pathfinder cosmological-hydrodynamical simulations to predict the occurrence rates of tidal features around satellite galaxies across group and cluster environments in the velocity-radius projected phase-space diagram to investigate the impact of these environments on tidal feature occurrence. We find that ancient infallers in the projected phase-space exhibit a decreasing tidal feature fraction with increasing halo mass, whereas recent infallers in the projected phase-space show unchanging tidal feature fractions with halo mass. Our results show, for the first time in cosmological simulations, a suppression of tidal feature fractions in the central regions of galaxy clusters, indicating a reduced merger rate due to higher cluster-centric velocities and lower galaxy total masses in the cluster centres. Using a toy model, we show that the presence of more tidal features in the recent infaller zone and cluster outskirts suggests that tidal features occur in interactions within infalling groups and dissipate by the time they are ancient infallers, indicating a $\lesssim3\pm2$ Gyr survival time of tidal features within clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), located near the South Pole, is among the first experiments there designed to detect ultra-high energy neutrinos through the Askaryan effect. When such neutrinos interact in dense media like ice, they initiate particle cascades that generate coherent radio pulses. Operating in the 150-850 MHz band, ARA is deployed 80-200 meters deep in Antarctic ice, where the radio background is exceptionally low. Despite this, experiments such as ARA must still account for continuous wave (CW) signals, which can originate from anthropogenic sources, instrumental noise, and other environmental factors. These CW signals can obscure faint neutrino-induced pulses, complicating data analysis and event identification. Over the years, ARA has developed and refined techniques for CW filtering and identification, including spectral analysis, notch filtering, and phase-variance methods. These approaches exploit CW characteristics such as their narrowband nature and persistence to separate contamination from genuine impulsive events. We review the main CW identification and filtering techniques developed within the ARA collaboration and present recent improvements in adaptive, multi-stage filtering pipelines. These advances have led to faster processing, simpler operation, and more accurate CW suppression, improving data analysis quality. Their efficacy is demonstrated across all ARA stations, underscoring their role in reducing event misclassification and enhancing performance. By refining these techniques, this work not only improves the sensitivity of ARA but also highlights the importance of robust CW filtering for current and future neutrino radio detection experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 The emissivity profile assumed in X-ray reflection spectroscopy significantly impacts black hole spin measurements. Using simulated NuSTAR spectra generated for lamppost and disk-like coronae with the relxill model suite, we evaluate systematic biases introduced when fitting with power-law or broken power-law emissivity profiles. We find that a simple power-law can accurately recover spins for low-height lamppost coronae with long exposures and low inclination angle, while broken power-laws introduce degeneracies when the simple power-law already performs adequately. However, for extended or high-height coronae, especially at high inclinations, both models produce large systematic biases unresolved by longer exposure times. Our results demonstrate that power-law approximations are reliable for compact coronae, highlighting the need for geometry-specific models in complex cases.

 - **Abstract**
 Isoprene and its oligomers, terpenes, are expected to be present, along with other complex organic molecules, in the diverse environments of the ISM and in our solar system. Due to insufficient spectral information of these molecules at low temperature, the detection and understanding of the importance of these molecules has been rather incomplete. For this purpose, we have carried out the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoabsorption measurements on pure molecular ices of isoprene and a few simple terpenes: limonene, $\alpha$-pinene and $\beta$-pinene by forming icy mantles on cold dust analogs. From these experiments, we report the first low-temperature (10 K) VUV spectra of isoprene and its oligomers, limonene, $\alpha$-pinene, and $\beta$-pinene. VUV photoabsorption spectra of all the molecules reported here reveal similarities in the ice and gas phase, as expected, except for isoprene, where a prominent red shift is observed in the ice phase absorption. This unique property of isoprene, along with distinctive absorption at longer wavelengths, supports its candidature for detection on icy bodies.

 - **Abstract**
 The accretion luminosity (Lacc) in young, low-mass stars is crucial for understanding stellar formation, but direct measurements are often hindered by limited spectral coverage and challenges in UV-excess modeling. Empirical relations linking Lacc to various accretion tracers are widely used to overcome these limitations. This work revisits these empirical relations using the PENELLOPE dataset, evaluating their applicability across different star-forming regions and to accreting young objects other than Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs). We analyzed the PENELLOPE VLT/X-Shooter dataset of 64 CTTSs, measuring fluxes of several accretion tracers and adopting the stellar and accretion parameters derived from PENELLOPE works. We supplemented our analysis with the ODYSSEUS HST data set, which covers a wider spectral range in NUV bands. We compared the Lacc values obtained in the PENELLOPE and ODYSSEUS surveys finding statistically consistent results. Our analysis confirms that existing empirical relations, previously derived for the Lupus sample, provide reliable Lacc estimates for CTTSs in several other star-forming regions. We revisit empirical relations for accretion tracers in our dataset, based on HST-fit, with coefficients which are consistent within 1sigma with XS-fit results for most lines. We also propose a method to estimate extinction using these relations and investigate the empirical relations for Brackett lines (Br8 to Br21). The Lacc vs Lline empirical relations can be successfully used for statistical studies of accretion on young forming objects in different star-forming regions. These relations also offer a promising approach to independently estimate extinction in CTTSs. We confirm that near-infrared lines (PaB and BrG) reliably trace Lacc in high accretors, making them valuable tools for probing accretion properties of high accreting young stars not accessible in the UVB.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray pulsars (XRPs) consist of a magnetized neutron star (NS) and an optical donor star. The NS accretes matter from the donor star producing pulsed X-ray emission. In most cases the donor stars are Be stars, and accretion is episodic, that is, the NSs are generally X-ray dim, but occasionally experience outbursts. Here, we carry out a statistical study with the X-ray monitoring data, and obtain strong correlations between the spin periods of the NSs and the outburst parameters for the first time. We show that XRPs containing faster rotating NSs tend to display more violent eruptions. In addition, pulsating ultraluminous X-ray sources in nearby galaxies follow the similar relationship. We demonstrate that most of these systems are close to the spin equilibrium, and that brighter pulsars have acquired more angular momentum by accreting matter from their companion stars, resulting in faster rotating NSs.
#### Unveiling Central ortho-H2D+ Depletion at Sub-kau Scales in Prestellar Core G205.46-14.56M3: The First Interferometric Evidence and Implications for Deuterium Chemistry

 - **Abstract**
 Prestellar cores represent the initial conditions of star formation, but heavy molecules such as CO are strongly depleted in their cold, dense interiors, limiting the ability to probe core centers. Deuterated molecular ions therefore emerge as key tracers because deuterium fractionation is enhanced at low temperatures. We present the first direct observation of ortho-H2D+ depletion in the prestellar core G205.46-14.56M3 using ALMA 820um continuum and ortho-H2D+(110-111) data at ~300-au resolution. We confirm the previously reported two substructures, B1 and B2, and identify a central ortho-H2D+ depletion zone toward B1 with ~6$\sigma$ contrast and an inferred diameter $\lesssim$600au, together with a peak $x$(N2D+)/$x$(N2H+)=$1.03^{+0.07}_{-0.56}$. The observationally inferred profiles of $x$(ortho-H2D+) and $x$(N2D+)/$x$(N2H+) are reproduced by a deuteration-focused chemo-dynamical model; however, the central ortho-H2D+ depletion is only marginally matched within the $2\sigma$ upper limit, likely suggesting additional deuteration in the depletion zone. From these models we infer a core age of ~0.42Ma, comparable to the free-fall time, suggesting that the substructures formed via rapid, turbulence-dominated fragmentation rather than slow, quasi-static contraction. Our observations also reveal that ortho-H2D+ velocity dispersions are largely subsonic in the core and nearly thermal between B1 and B2, consistent with turbulence dissipating within a few free-fall times. These results highlight the critical role of deuterated ions for both chemical evolution and dynamics in dense cores.
#### Modelling the effect of stellar metallicity on the XUV evolution of low-mass stars and its impact on exoplanet atmospheres/habitability

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how exoplanet atmospheres evolve is a key question in the context of habitability. One key process governing this evolution is atmospheric evaporation by stellar X-ray and EUV emission (collectively, XUV). As such, the evolution of exoplanet atmospheres is closely tied to the evolution of the host star's magnetic activity. Many studies have modelled the combined evolution of exoplanet atmospheres and their host stars. However, to date, the impact of the host star's metallicity on stellar activity/exoplanet atmosphere evolution has not been explored. In this work, we investigate how stellar metallicity affects the rotation and activity evolution of solar-like stars as well as the corresponding exoplanet atmospheric evolution. We reconfirm previous results that metal-rich stars spin down more rapidly than metal-poor stars. We also find that the XUV flux that an exoplanet in the habitable zone of its host star receives is larger when the host star is more metal-rich. As such, the atmospheres of exoplanets in the habitable zones of metal-rich stars are evaporated more rapidly than exoplanets in the habitable zones of metal-poor stars. Lastly, we find that the atmospheric evolution is most sensitive to the host star metallicity when the host star has a higher mass. In the highest mass solar-stars, the metallicity can have a larger influence on the atmospheric evolution than the initial rotation period of the star.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrodynamic simulations can connect outflow observables to the physical conditions of outflowing gas. Here, we use simulations of isolated disk galaxies ranging from dwarf mass ($M_{200} = 10^{10}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) to Milky Way mass ($M_{200} = 10^{12}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), based on the FIRE-2 subgrid models to investigate multiphase galactic outflows. We use the CHIMES non-equilibrium chemistry module to create synthetic spectra of common outflow tracers ([CII]$_{158\rm{\mu m}}$, $\mathrm{CO}_{J(1-0)}$, H$\alpha$ and $[\mathrm{OIII}]_{5007\text{A}}$). Using our synthetic spectra we measure the mass outflow rate, kinetic power and momentum flux using observational techniques. In [CII]$_{158\rm{\mu m}}$ we measure outflow rates of $10^{-4}$ to $1$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$ across an SFR range of $10^{-3}$ to $1$ $\text{M}_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$, which is in reasonable agreement with observations. The significant discrepancy is in $\mathrm{CO}_{J(1-0)}$, with the simulations lying $\approx1$ dex below the observational sample. We test observational assumptions used to derive outflow properties from synthetic spectra. We find the greatest uncertainty lies in measurements of electron density, as estimates using the SII doublet can overestimate the actual electron density by up to 2 dex, which changes mass outflow rates by up to 4 dex. We also find that molecular outflows are especially sensitive to the conversion factor between CO luminosity and H2 mass, with outflow rates changing by up to 4 dex in our least massive galaxy. Comparing the outflow properties derived from the synthetic spectra to those derived directly from the simulation, we find that [CII]$_{158\rm{\mu m}}$ probes outflows at greater distances from the disk, whilst we find that molecular gas does not survive at large distances within outflows within our modestly star-forming disk galaxies simulated in this work.
#### Outflow-cloud interaction as the possible origin of the peculiar radio emission in the tidal disruption event AT2018cqh

 - **Abstract**
 AT2018cqh is a unique optical tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered in a dwarf galaxy exhibiting delayed X-ray and radio flares. We present the results from high-resolution VLBA and e-MERLIN radio observations of AT2018cqh extending to $\delta$t $\sim$ 2250 days post discovery, which reveal a compact radio emission, unresolved at a scale of <~ 0.13 pc at 7.6 GHz, with a high brightness temperature of $T_b$ ~> 4.03 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ K. The radio spectral energy distribution (SED) is found to gradually shift towards a higher peak flux density and frequency over a period of $\sim$1000 days. An equipartition analysis suggests that there is a little change in the radio emitting region over this period, while the electron density increases by a factor of 3. The radio light curve at 0.89 GHz continues to rise, with a bump feature lasting for 240 days. These properties are in contrast to the predictions of standard shockwave model from a diffuse circumnuclear medium, but could be explained if dense clouds exist in the circumnuclear environment. The latter scenario is supported by our hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of TDE outflow with a cloud, which can reproduce the temporal evolution in the radio SED. This work highlights the importance of the outflow-cloud interaction in explaining the delayed, fast-rising radio emission observed in some TDEs, especially those occurring in galaxies with pre-existing AGN activity.
