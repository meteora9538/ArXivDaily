 - **Abstract**
 Reconstructing the star formation history (SFH) of disk galaxies is central to understanding their growth and evolution, yet such estimates can be strongly biased by stellar radial migration - the redistribution of angular momenta over cosmic time. Using 186 Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) analogues from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, we compare star formation rates (SFRs) inferred from present-day stellar positions with those based on stellar birth radii to quantify the magnitude, spatial structure, and temporal evolution of migration-induced biases. We find that radial migration systematically produces artificial star formation in regions that had not yet formed stars. Notably, about 80% of galaxies exhibit outer-disk stars older than 10 Gyr, implying that these populations must have migrated from the inner disk. Similar effects appear in about 45% of galaxies at intermediate radii during early epochs, and in 30% of quenched inner disks within the past 4 Gyr. Migration also smooths SFHs, washing out localized bursts and periods of suppressed star formation by dispersing stars across neighboring radii. The strength and imprint of these distortions depend sensitively on galactic structure and evolutionary history: strong bars drive mean SFR overestimates of up to 75% in the inner disk and 150% in the outskirts; thinner, dynamically cold disks suffer average outer-disk biases up to 160%; while thick disks exhibit typical inner-disk biases up to 125%. Merger timing further modulates these patterns. Our results demonstrate that failing to account for stellar migration can lead to severe misinterpretations of when and where stars formed, with direct implications for the chemical and evolutionary histories of the MW and external galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a group of field dwarf galaxies which includes on-the-fly radiative transfer (RT) and is evolved to $z=0$. Emission from stars is included according to age-dependent spectra, and a redshift-dependent UV background. The inclusion of RT results in the formation of eight additional faint dwarf galaxies with stellar masses of $10^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$ to several $10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ and only old stellar populations, similar to the observed Ultra-Faint Dwarf galaxies. They formed before and during cosmic reionisation and were mostly quenched by $z \sim 3-4$. The simulated galaxies follow many observed scaling relations such as the stellar mass-halo mass relation, the mass-size relation, and the luminosity-velocity dispersion relation. For the more massive dwarf galaxies, radiative feedback suppresses star formation, making it less bursty and reducing explosive outflows. This consequently reduces the dark matter core sizes by a factor of 2-3, rendering the core sizes ($\sim$ 1 kpc) more consistent with observations. The distribution of HI in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is ubiquitous with a covering fraction of unity within $R_{vir}$, in good agreement with observations. It is rather insensitive to radiative or SN feedback at $z=0$, but at $z>5$ it is much higher in the RT simulation. In contrast, the distribution of low ions like SiII is very compact and declines sharply beyond the ISM scale. CIV and OVI have a more extended distribution, but their column densities are generally below the detection limit. Radiative feedback leads to smaller column densities of the metal ions, partly due to the reduction of total metal production, and partly because hard photons from the stellar radiation escape the ISM and further ionise the CGM. The abundance of CIV is particularly sensitive to the latter effect.

 - **Abstract**
 The galaxy LEDA 1313424 has recently been discovered to have nine rings [1]. The authors of the discovery paper interpret the rings to be the result of the passing of a smaller galaxy through the center of the LEDA galaxy 56 Myr ago. We point out several difficulties with this interpretation and propose instead that the rings of LEDA are the imprint upon baryonic matter of caustic rings of dark matter. Caustic rings of dark matter, with the pattern of radii observed in the LEDA galaxy, form if the dark matter is axions. Because they move slowly (LEDA's 70 kpc ring, for example, has speed 6.6 km/s) caustic rings of dark matter are plausible sites for the star formation observed in LEDA.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) have revealed abundant reservoirs of neutral hydrogen (HI) in low redshift post-starburst galaxies (PSBs), raising the question of why star formation ceases rapidly in these systems. In this study, we present a detailed analysis of the shape of the integrated HI spectra of 67 PSBs. We find that PSBs exhibit significantly higher HI spectral concentration values ($K$) compared to a matched sample from xGASS, and are more comparable to those of starburst galaxies. By extending our analysis to spatially resolved HI data from THINGS and ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$, we show that both centrally concentrated HI distributions and dynamically unsettled HI can effectively increase $K$, while non-axisymmetric structures only contribute to the scatter of the $K$ distribution. Distinguishing between central concentration and dynamically unsettled gas as the origin of high $K$ can be achieved by measuring the spectral asymmetry ($A_{\rm F}$), making the $K$-$A_{\rm F}$ plane a powerful diagnostic tool for identifying galaxies with unsettled HI using integrated spectra alone. Based on their location in the $K$-$A_{\rm F}$ plane, we find that most PSBs are not dominated by unsettled HI, but rather exhibit elevated central gas concentration. Both modes of gas redistribution in PSBs may eventually contribute to their quenching.
#### The BlueDOG at Cosmic Noon: A Possible Analog to Little Red Dots?

 - **Abstract**
 We discovered a hyperluminous dust-obscured galaxy with mysterious blue-excess emission (BlueDOG) in rest-frame UV of its spectral energy distribution (SED) from a multi-wavelength survey in the AKARI Deep Field - South (ADF-S). We present the results of SED analysis with multiwavelength photometric data and spectroscopic analysis, observed with Gemini-S/GMOS, FLAMINGOS-2, to explore the origin of blue-excess emission of a hyperluminous BlueDOG, ADFS-KMTDOG-102, at z=2.6. The SED analysis shows that this BlueDOG is a highly massive system (log $M_{*}$/$M_\odot=12.3$) with substantial extinction. Additionally, the proportion of the old stellar population exceeds that of the young stellar population, which suggests stellar evolution cumulated from the early universe. The mass of supermassive black hole (SMBH) estimated using the extinction-corrected broad H$\rm\alpha$ emission line yields log $M_{\rm BH}$/$M_\odot$=10.2. We discuss the similarity between the BlueDOG and 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), recently discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope, showing SED shapes remarkably similar to those of LRDs. The UV emission line ratios indicate that the emission lines are primarily powered by the central active galactic nuclei (AGN). In contrast, the origin of the blue-excess UV continuum remains ambiguous, since both recent star formation and AGN-induced scattered light are viable explanations, based on the results from the SED fitting and scattered light modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 The star-forming complex of Corona Australis (CrA) is one of the closest and most isolated molecular clouds. It belongs to a chain of clusters that show age gradients with distance from the galactic plane. We aim to provide suggestions regarding its formation history by examining the stellar and disk populations, stellar multiplicity, and interstellar absorption. We made a census of stars and disks using Gaia DR3 and infrared data. Interstellar absorption in the direction of each star was derived by comparing SpTy from the literature and Gaia colors. Stellar multiplicity analysis accounts for both direct observation of visual companions (Gaia data and high-contrast imaging) and indirect detection of the presence of companions (eclipsing and spectroscopic binaries, and astrometry). The properties of the disks were obtained from the slopes of the spectral energy distributions. As found in previous studies, the CrA complex can be divided into two regions: a younger region (CrA-Main: 3+/-1Myr) and an older one (CrA-North: 6.7+/-0.3Myr), slightly younger than previously thought. While CrA-Main still appears bound to the gas, CrA-North is unbound and expanding. The stars that belong to CrA-North were in the most compact configuration 3.72Myr ago. At that time, CrA-Main and CrA-North were much closer to each other than they appear now. The fraction of disk-bearing stars is higher in Main than in North, as also expected due to the younger age of CrA-Main. We propose a formation history scenario for the CrA-complex. It started between 15 and 18 Myr ago with SNe explosions in the Upper Centaurus-Lupus complex, followed by a quiescent phase with little star formation. A star formation episode about 7Myr ago formed CrA-North stars. About 3.7Myr ago, a second SN explosion south of CrA-North triggered star formation in CrA-Main. This last SN might have been the origin of the pulsar RX J1856.5-3754.
#### On Ultra-long Period (53.8 min) Pulsar ASKAP J1935+2148: Coherent Radio Emission Triggered by Local Superstrong Magnetic Reconnection

 - **Abstract**
 The eight ultra-long period pulsars (ULPPs) in radio bands have been discovered recently, e.g., ASKAP J1935+2148 with a spin period of 53.8\,min, which are much longer than those of normal pulsars, spanning from 0.016\,s to 23.5\,s, however the origins, spin evolutions and emission mechanisms of these sources are still puzzling. We investigate how the ultra-long period of ASKAP J1935+2148 is evolved by the braking of relativistic particle wind, in a time scale of about 0.1 - 1 Myr, from a normal pulsar with local superstrong magnetic fields. In addition, it is noticed that the ULPPs in the period versus period derivative diagram are much below the ``death line", implying their different characteristics from the normal pulsars. Five sources (including ASKAP J1935+2148) in total eight ULPPs share the rotational energy loss rates to be lower than their respective radio emission luminosities, a phenomenon that can be accounted for by the sustainable radio bursts induced through the reconnection of locally concentrated magnetic field this http URL diversity and complexity of ULPP radio emissions should be closely related to the presence of magnetic reconnection rather than rotational powered discharges in the gaps. Furthermore, it is suggested that the coherent radio emissions of pulsars may have two origins, one from the rotation-powered electric voltage that accounts for the normal pulsar phenomena and the other from the magnetic reconnection-induced continual radio bursts that account for the ULPP observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first dataset of collisional (de)-excitation rate coefficients of HCN induced by CO, one of the main perturbing gases in cometary atmospheres. The dataset spans the temperature range of 5-50 K. It includes both state-to-state rate coefficients involving the lowest ten and nine rotational levels of HCN and CO, respectively, and the so-called "thermalized" rate coefficients over the rotational population of CO at each kinetic temperature. The derivation of these coefficients exploited the good performance of the statistical adiabatic channel model (SACM) on top of an accurate interaction potential computed at the CCSD(T)-F12b/CBS level of theory. The reliability of the SACM approach was validated by comparison with full quantum calculations restricted at the lowest total angular momentum of the system. These results provide essential input to accurately model the distribution among the rotational energy levels and the abundance of HCN in cometary atmospheres, accounting for deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium that typically occurs in such environments.
#### Energetic proton dropouts during the Juno flyby of Europa strongly depend on magnetic field perturbations

 - **Abstract**
 During Juno's only flyby of Europa, the Jupiter Energetic Particle Detector Instrument (JEDI) measured complex dropouts in the energetic ion flux in Europa's wake. We investigate the causes of these dropouts, focusing specifically on energetic protons of ~100 keV and ~1 MeV, using back-tracking particle simulations, a prescribed description of Europa's atmosphere and a three-dimensional single fluid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model of the plasma-atmosphere interaction. We investigate the role of magnetic field perturbations resulting from the interaction between Jupiter's magnetospheric plasma and Europa's atmosphere and the presence of field-aligned electron beams in Europa's wake. We compare the simulated effect of the perturbed fields on the pitch angle distributions of the ion losses to Juno-JEDI measurements. We find that at ~100 keV, field perturbations are the dominant factor controlling the distribution of the losses along the flyby, while at ~1 MeV a combination of field perturbations and absorption by the surface due to short half bounce periods is required to explain the measured losses. We also find that the effect of charge-exchange with Europa's tenuous atmosphere is weak and absorption by dust in Europa's environment is negligible. Furthermore, we find that the perturbed magnetic fields which best represent the measurements are those that account for the plasma interaction with a sub-/anti-Jovian asymmetric atmosphere, non-uniform ionization of the atmosphere, and electron beams. This sensitivity to the specific field perturbation demonstrates that combining observations and modeling of proton depletions constitute an important tool to probe the electromagnetic field and atmospheric configurations of Europa.
#### The AstroSat UV Deep Field South-V: Constraints on the average escape of ionizing photons in the cosmic dusk

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the escape of ionizing (Lyman-continuum; LyC) photons from 49 star-forming galaxies at redshifts $\sim 1-1.5$, using far-ultraviolet (FUV) imaging from the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat. The sample spans a wide range of stellar masses and UV luminosities. LyC emission is undetected in most galaxies (42/49), and stacking these galaxies yields only an upper limit on the observed LyC-to-nonionizing UV flux density ratio ($({F}_{\lambda,\rm{LyC}}/{F}_{\lambda,\rm{UV}})_{\rm{obs}}<0.12$). Including all galaxies (with 7 LyC-leaker candidates) produces a marginal $2.4\sigma$ detection, suggesting that the average LyC signal is driven by a small number of sources. To identify the conditions favorable for LyC escape, we perform stacking analyses in bins of stellar mass, UV slope, compactness, inclination, and star formation rate surface density. A stacked LyC signal is detected at a significance of $\sim3\sigma$ from a subset of galaxies that are characterized as being compact, have high star formation rate surface densities, and blue UV continuum slopes, despite each of these being individually undetected in LyC. This provides the first systematic evidence at $z\sim 1-1.5$ linking these properties to LyC escape, consistent with trends observed in the lower redshift universe. Additionally, LyC leakage appears more efficient in low-mass galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_{*}/M_{\odot})<9.5$), with their average absolute escape fraction ranging from $\langle f_{\text{esc,abs}} \rangle\sim0.1-0.2$ depending on stellar population assumptions. These results support the scenario that compact, low-mass starbursts were key contributors to the ionizing photon budget during cosmic reionization.
#### Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distances to NGC 1316, NGC 1380, NGC 1404, & NGC 4457: A Pilot Study of a Parallel Distance Ladder Using Type Ia Supernovae in Early-Type Host Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Though type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are found in all types of galaxies, recent local Hubble constant measurements have disfavored using SNe Ia in early-type or quiescent galaxies, aiming instead for better consistency with SNe Ia in star-forming, late-type host galaxies calibrated by Cepheid distances. Here we investigate the feasibility of a parallel distance ladder using SNe Ia exclusively in quiescent, massive ($\log M_*/M_{\odot} \geq 10$) host galaxies, calibrated by tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances. We present TRGB measurements to four galaxies: three measured from the Hubble Space Telescope with the ACS F814W filter, and one measured from the JWST NIRCam F090W filter. Combined with literature measurements, we define a TRGB calibrator sample of five high-mass, early-type galaxies that hosted well-measured SNe Ia: NGC 1316 (SN 2006dd), NGC 1380 (SN 1992A), NGC 1404 (SN 2007on, SN 2011iv), NGC 4457 (SN 2020nvb), and NGC 4636 (SN 2020ue). We jointly standardize these calibrators with a fiducial sample of 124 Hubble-flow SNe Ia from the Zwicky Transient Facility that are matched in host-galaxy and light-curve properties. Our results with this homogenized subsample show a Hubble residual scatter of under 0.11 mag, lower than usually observed in cosmological samples of the full SN~Ia distribution. We obtain a measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 75.3 \pm 2.9$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, including statistical and estimated systematic uncertainties, and discuss the potential to further improve the precision of this approach. As calibrator and supernova samples grow, we advocate that future cosmological applications of SNe Ia use subsamples matched in host-galaxy and supernova properties across redshift.
#### Joint Analysis of HI Absorption Zeeman Measurements and the Morphology of Filamentary HI Emission

 - **Abstract**
 We present a joint analysis of HI absorption Zeeman measurements and the morphology of filamentary HI emission to investigate the three-dimensional structure of the magnetic field in the diffuse neutral interstellar medium (ISM). Our analysis is based on the Arecibo Millennium Survey and new data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) toward radio sources 3C 75, 3C 207, and 3C 409. Toward 3C 409, we make a 4$\sigma$ Zeeman detection and infer $B_{LOS}$ = 9.1 +/- 1.9$\mu$G, in agreement with Arecibo results. We quantify the dispersion of HI filaments at the locations and velocities of Zeeman components using GALFA-HI narrow-channel emission maps. Focusing on a subsample of 42 spectrally distinct components, we find a weak but statistically significant positive correlation (Spearman r = 0.3, $p = 0.01$) between $|B_{LOS}|$ and the circular variance of HI filament orientation angles. To examine its origin, we characterize the environments probed by HI absorption using dust emission, 3D dust maps, OH absorption, and CO emission. We find evidence that existing HI absorption Zeeman measurements trace magnetic fields that are coherent on parsec scales, probe primarily local gas ($100$-$500$ pc, often at distances consistent with the Local Bubble wall), and exhibit systematic differences in the magnitude of $B_{LOS}$. We attribute the correlation between Zeeman measurements and filamentary HI morphology to large-scale variations in magnetic field strength and/or inclination angle across different Galactic environments, which could arise due to the Local Bubble geometry or enhanced total field strength in denser regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The astrophysics of Long GRB (LGRB) progenitors as well as possible cosmological evolution in their properties still poses many open questions. Previous studies suggest that the LGRB rate density (LGRB-RD) follows the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) only at high-z and attribute this to the metallicity evolution of progenitor stars. For low z, opinions differ on whether the uptick in the LGRB RD is due to a distinct class of low-luminosity GRBs or perhaps even a different progenitor subclass. To investigate these questions, we utilize data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and ground-based observatories (redshift). To test the hypothesis that the observations can be mapped (with/without evolution) to the well-established cosmic SFRD, we consider three cases: no evolution, beaming angle evolution, and a simple power-law evolution. The comparison shows that the 'no evolution' case can be ruled out. Our study highlights that the beaming angle evolution or the simple power law evolution are also not sufficient to obtain a good match between the LGRB-RD and SFRD. Rather, the inclusion of multiple evolving properties of LGRBs in combination appears to be required to match the two rate densities in their entirety.
