 - **Abstract**
 The origin of binary black hole (BH) mergers remains a topic of active debate, with effective spins (chi_eff) measured by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration providing crucial insights. In this study, our objective is to investigate the empirical chi_eff distribution (and constrain individual spin components) of binary BH mergers and compare them with extensive simulations, assuming that they originate purely from isolated binaries or a mixture of formation channels. We explore scenarios using BH kicks with and without the effect of spin-axis tossing during BH formation. We employ simple yet robust Monte Carlo simulations of the final core collapse forming the second-born BH, using minimal assumptions to ensure transparency and reproducibility. The synthetic chi_eff distribution is compared to the empirical data from LVK science runs O1-O3 using functional data analysis, kernel density estimations, and three different statistical tests, accounting for data uncertainties. We find strong indications for spin-axis tossing during BH formation if LVK sources are dominated by the isolated binary channel. Simulations with spin-axis tossing achieve high p-values (up to 0.882) using Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling tests, while without tossing, all p-values drop below 0.001 for isolated binaries. A statistically acceptable solution without tossing, however, emerges if ~72+/-8% of detected binary BH mergers result from dynamical interactions causing random BH spin directions. Finally, for an isolated binary origin, we find a preference for mass reversal in ~30% of the progenitor binaries. Predictions from this study can be tested with LVK O4+O5 data as well as the 3G detectors, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, enabling improved constraints on formation channel ratios and the critical question of BH spin-axis tossing.
#### Meridional circulation molecular-weighted

 - **Abstract**
 Meridional circulation in stratified stellar/planetary interiors in the presence of stable molecular weight gradients remains poorly understood, thereby affecting angular momentum transport in evolutionary models. We extend the downward control principle of atmospheric sciences to include compositional stratification. Using a linearized analysis we show that stable compositional gradients slow down the penetration of circulation into the depths, emphasizing the importance of time-dependent solutions. However, additional effects such as horizontal turbulence or magnetic fields are needed to halt it completely. We also find limits demarcating linear and nonlinear regimes in terms of Schmidt and Rossby numbers. Nonlinear simulations exhibit compositional mixing due to meridional currents, enabling deeper penetration than otherwise. We propose slowly evolving and steady-state for the solar tachocline, and helioseismically observed heavy element abundances, acknowledging the absence of constraints on the radial variation of the Schmidt number. In the context of stellar evolution, differential rotation profiles of solar-type main-sequence stars may follow analytical solutions extending from Banik & Menou (2024), thereby aiding further probes into magneto/hydrodynamic instabilities and outward angular momentum transport.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Synthesizer, a fast, flexible, modular and extensible platform for modelling synthetic astrophysical observables. Synthesizer can be used for a number of applications, but is predominantly designed for generating mock observables from analytical and numerical galaxy formation simulations. These use cases include (but are not limited to) analytical modelling of the star formation and metal enrichment histories of galaxies, the creation of mock images and integral field unit observations from particle based simulations, detailed photoionisation modelling of the central regions of active galactic nuclei, and spectro-photometric fitting. We provide a number of stellar population synthesis models, photoionisation code configurations, dust models, and imaging configurations that can be used 'out-of-the-box' interactively. We invite and encourage the community to use, test and develop the code, and hope that the foundation developed will provide a flexible framework for a number of tasks in forward and inverse modelling of astrophysical observables.

 - **Abstract**
 The carbon to oxygen (C/O) abundance ratio is a valuable tracer of star formation history, as C and O enrichment occurs on different timescales. However, measurements based on ultraviolet (UV) collisionally excited lines and those based on optical recombination lines may be subject to biases from the abundance discrepancy factor (ADF), which is well established for oxygen but uncertain for carbon. We present precise UV-based measurements of gas-phase C$^{2+}$/O$^{2+}$ ionic abundance in four H II regions which have prior optical-based measurements, combined with archival UV data for two additional H II regions, in order to establish a reliable abundance scale and to investigate biases between the two methods. We find a clear ADF for the C$^{2+}$ ion which is consistent with that of O$^{2+}$, assuming a similar temperature structure in the zones of the nebula which these ions occupy. The C/O abundance derived from UV collisional lines and optical recombination lines is therefore also consistent to within $<0.1$ dex, with an offset of $0.05\pm0.03$ dex in C$^{2+}$/O$^{2+}$ for the standard T$_e$ method. While the absolute C/H and O/H abundances are subject to large uncertainty from the ADF, our results establish that C/O abundances measured from these different methods can be reliably compared. Thus we confirm the robustness of gas-phase C/O measurements for studying galaxy evolution and star formation timescales, including from rest-UV observations of high redshift galaxies with JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars that contain only trace amounts of elements heavier than helium, referred to as having low "metallicity", preserve the chemical fingerprints of the first generation of stars and supernovae. In the Milky Way, the lowest metallicity stars show an extreme over-abundance of carbon relative to other elements, which has been hypothesized to be a unique result of the first low-energy supernovae. However, the origin of this signature has remained a mystery, since no such stars have been discovered in the ancient dwarf galaxies where they are thought to have formed. Here, we present observations of a star in the >10 billion year old ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Pictor II, that shows the lowest iron and calcium abundances outside the Milky Way (<1/43,000th solar and ~1/160,000th solar), with a factor of >3000x relative carbon enhancement. As the first unambiguous second-generation star in a relic dwarf galaxy, this object demonstrates that carbon-enhanced second-generation stars can originate in primordial small-scale systems. This star supports the hypothesis that carbon-enhancement is produced by low-energy-supernovae, since the yields of energetic supernovae are harder to retain in small-scale environments. This key local signature of chemical enrichment by the first stars traces a regime inaccessible to current high-redshift observations, which cannot detect the early enrichment of the smallest galaxies.
#### Bursting at the seams: the star-forming main sequence and its scatter at z=3-9 using NIRCam photometry from JADES

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) and its scatter at redshifts $3 \leq z \leq 9$, using NIRCam photometry from the JADES survey in the GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields. Our analysis is based on a sample of galaxies that is stellar mass complete down to $\log \left(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\right) \approx 8.1$. The redshift evolution of the SFMS at an averaging timescale of 10 Myr follows a relation, quantified by the specific star-formation rates (sSFR$_{10}$), of $\mathrm{sSFR}\propto(1+z)^{\mu}$ with $\mu = 2.30^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$, in good agreement with theoretical predictions and the specific mass accretion rate of dark matter halos. We find that the SFMS normalisation varies in a complex way with the SFR averaging timescale, reflecting the combined effects of bursty star formation and rising star formation histories (SFHs). We quantify the scatter of the SFMS, revealing that it decreases with longer SFR averaging timescales, from $\sigma_{\rm{int}} \approx 0.4-0.5~\mathrm{dex}$ at 10 Myr to $\sigma_{\rm{int}} \approx 0.2~\mathrm{dex}$ at 100 Myr, indicating that shorter-term fluctuations dominate the scatter, although long-term variations in star formation activity are also present. Our findings suggest that bursty SFHs are more pronounced at lower stellar masses. Furthermore, we explore the implications of our results for the observed over-abundance of UV-bright galaxies at $z > 10$, concluding that additional mechanisms, such as top-heavy initial mass functions, increased star-formation efficiencies, or increased burstiness in star formation are needed to explain these observations. Finally, we emphasize the importance of accurate stellar mass completeness limits when fitting the SFMS, especially for galaxies with bursty SFHs.
#### Investigating the residuals in the $M_\bullet-M_*$ relation using the SIMBA cosmological simulation

 - **Abstract**
 We study the scaling relation between the black hole and stellar mass ($M_\bullet-M_*$), diagnosing the residual $\Delta \log(M_\bullet/M_\odot)$ ($\Delta$) in this relation to understand the coevolution of the galaxy and black hole (BH) in the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation SIMBA. We showed that SIMBA can reproduce the observed $M_\bullet-M_*$ relation well with little difference between central and satellite galaxies. By using the median value to determine the residuals, we found that the residual is correlated with galaxy cold gas content, star formation rate, colour and black hole accretion properties. Both torque and Bondi models implemented in SIMBA, contribute to this residual, with torque accretion playing a major role at high redshift and low-mass galaxies, while Bondi (also BH merge) takes over at low redshift and massive galaxies. By dividing the sample into two populations: $\Delta>0$ and $\Delta <0$, we compared their evolution paths following the main progenitors. With evolution tracking, we proposed a simple picture for the BH-galaxy coevolution: Early-formed galaxies seeded black holes earlier, with stellar mass increasing rapidly to quickly reach the point of triggering `jet mode' feedback. This process reduced the cold gas content and stopped the growth of $M_*$, effectively quenching galaxies. Meanwhile, during the initial phase of torque accretion growth, the BH mass is comparable between galaxies formed early and those formed later. However, those galaxies that formed earlier appear to attain a marginally greater BH mass when shifting to Bondi accretion, aligning with the galaxy transition time. As the early-formed galaxies reach this point earlier -- leaving a longer time for them to have Bondi accretion as well as merging, their residuals become positive, i.e., having more massive BHs at $z=0$ compared to these late-formed galaxies at the same $M_*$. This picture is further supported by the strong positive correlation between the residuals and the galaxy age, which we are proposing as a verification with observation data on this story suggested by SIMBA.
#### TeV Afterglows of Gamma-Ray Bursts: Theoretical Analysis and Prospects for Future Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Recent detections of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at TeV energies opened new prospects for investigating radiative environments and particle acceleration mechanisms under extreme conditions. In this paper, we study the afterglows of these GRBs - namely GRB 180720B, GRB 190114C, GRB 190829A, GRB 201216C, and GRB 221009A - modeling their synchrotron and inverse Compton emission within the framework of an optimized relativistic fireball model. We constrain the model parameters and their temporal evolution by applying our theoretical model to the high-energy emission in the X-ray and GeV-TeV energy bands observed at intermediate and late times. Our results reveal interesting differences among the TeV-detected GRBs, potentially reflecting a variety of underlying physical processes that lead to different maximum energies $E_{\text{max}}= \, \gamma_{\text{max}}\, m_e \, c^2$ of the accelerated particles responsible for the GRB high-energy emission. We indeed obtain different behaviors of the late TeV afterglows that ultimately depend on $\gamma_{\text{max}}$. We discuss how late afterglow observations - on timescales of hours and days - of X-ray and GeV-TeV emissions are crucial for providing diagnostics of the physical processes behind GRBs, and we emphasize the theoretical expectations for future TeV observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent Far-Infrared Polarimetric Large-Area Central Molecular Zone Exploration (FIREPLACE) survey with SOFIA has mapped plane-of-the-sky magnetic field orientations within the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way. Applying the Histogram of Relative Orientation (HRO) analysis to the FIREPLACE data, we find that the relative orientation between magnetic fields and column density structures is random in low-density regions (2x10^22<N(H2)<10^23 cm^{-2}), but becomes preferentially parallel in high-density regions (>10^23 cm^{-2}). This trend is in contrast with that of the nearby molecular clouds, where the relative orientation transitions from parallel to perpendicular with increasing column densities. However, the relative orientation varies between individual CMZ clouds. Comparisons with MHD simulations specific to the CMZ conditions suggest that the observed parallel alignment is intrinsic rather than artifacts caused by the projection effect. The origin of this parallel configuration may arise from the fact that most dense structures in the CMZ are not self-gravitating, as they are in super-virial states, except for the mini-starburst region Sgr B2. These findings are consistent with the low star formation efficiency observed in the CMZ compared to that in the Galactic disk.
