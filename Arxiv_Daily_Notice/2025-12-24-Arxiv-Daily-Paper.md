 - **Abstract**
 The KASI Deep Rolling Imaging Fast Telescope (K-DRIFT) is a pioneering instrument designed to explore low-surface-brightness (LSB) phenomena. This white paper presents a compelling array of science cases that showcase K-DRIFT's unique capabilities in unraveling the mysteries of intracluster light (ICL) and other LSB components within galaxy clusters. Exploring the origin of ICL in galaxy clusters and comparing the spatial distributions of ICL and dark matter will offer new insights into galaxy cluster dynamics. Moreover, investigating LSB objects in galaxy clusters, such as LSB structures in the brightest cluster galaxy, ultra-diffuse galaxies, and tidal features, will enhance our understanding of galaxy evolution within the cluster environment. We present our strategies for addressing scientific queries, encompassing LSB observation and analysis techniques, specialized simulations, and machine-learning approaches. Additionally, we examine the potential synergies between K-DRIFT and other ongoing or forthcoming multi-wavelength surveys. This white paper advocates for the recognition and support of K-DRIFT as a dedicated tool for advancing our understanding of the universe's subtlest phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of two tailed radio galaxies in the COSMOS field, associated with a massive, dynamically unrelaxed galaxy group detected in X-rays at z = 0.349. One of them is a wide-angle tail (WAT) galaxy, supporting the role of WATs as tracers of dynamically young groups and clusters. Our multiwavelength analysis combines VLA radio data, HST-ACS imaging, COSMOS2020 photometric redshifts, COSMOS2015 photometry, the newest compilation of spectroscopic redshifts in COSMOS, and X-ray observations from Chandra and XMM-Newton. We used these data to study the tailed radio galaxies, their host galaxies, and the group environment. Both radio galaxies are hosted by massive ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=11.88\pm0.03$ and $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=11.49\pm0.06$), red, elliptical galaxies with extended stellar halos, as revealed by a color, magnitude, and stellar mass analysis combined with GALFIT modeling and surface-brightness profiles. One corresponds to the brightest group galaxy (BGG), while the other is the second-brightest. A diffuse intragroup medium (IGM) is characterized by its irregular shape and the analysis of the X-ray spectra of the group core reveals high temperature ($T_X=2.4\pm0.6\hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{keV}$) and an electron density of $(8.2\pm0.3)\times 10^{-4}\hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. A galaxy overdensity associated with the group was detected via Voronoi tessellation, using COSMOS2020 CLASSIC photometric redshifts, displaying an irregular morphology, along with evidence of substructure. Assuming the jet bending results from interaction with the IGM, we find a high relative velocity between the BGG and the IGM ($v_{\mathrm{BGG/IGM}} \gtrsim 540$ km/s), primarily due to bulk gas motion. Our findings indicate a dynamically young system in the early stages of assembly via group-group merging.

 - **Abstract**
 Super-Alfvénic turbulence is widespread in astrophysical environments, including molecular clouds and the diffuse plasma of galaxy clusters. At large scales, magnetic fields play only a minor dynamical role; however, for sufficiently extended turbulent cascades, the motions transition into the MHD regime at a characteristic scale $l_A$. We introduce a new diagnostic based on the structure functions of the gradient directions, which can be obtained directly from spectroscopic and synchrotron intensity observations. We demonstrate that the new measure robustly recovers the transition scale $l_A$. Building on this result, we propose a generalized expression that replaces the traditional Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method for estimating magnetic field strength in the super-Alfvénic regime, where the DCF approach fails. We further show how the magnetization and magnetic field strength of diffuse media, such as the intracluster medium, can be inferred using synchrotron intensity maps. Our theoretical predictions are validated through numerical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Accreting X-ray pulsars (XRPs) undergo different physical regimes depending on the mass accretion rate. Recent observations have shown a dramatic change in the emission properties of this class of sources observed at low luminosity. We explore the timing and spectral properties of the XRP MAXI J0655-013 observed in the low-luminosity regime (about 5x$10^{33}$ erg/s) to witness the corresponding spectral shape and pulse profiles. We employ recent $XMM$ and $NuSTAR$ pointed observations of the MAXI J0655-013 X-ray activity during the low-luminosity stage. We explore several spectral models to fit the data and test theoretical expectations of the dramatic transition of the spectral shape. We study the pulsating nature of the source and find a phase-connected timing solution. We explore the energy-resolved pulse profiles and the derived energy-dependence of different pulsed fraction estimators ($PF_{minmax}$ and $PF_{rms}$). We also obtain $NuSTAR$ pulsed fraction spectra (PFS) at different luminosity regimes. MAXI J0655-013 spectrum is well fitted by a double Comptonization model, in agreement with recent observational results and theoretical expectations that explain the observed spectrum as being composed of two distinct bumps, each dominated by different polarization modes. We measure a spin period of $1081.86\pm0.02$ s, consistent with the source spinning-up compared to previous observations, yielding an upper limit for the magnetic field strength of B<9x$10^{13}$ G. The pulse profiles show a single broad peak interrupted by a sharp dip that coincides with an increase in the hardness ratio. For the low-luminosity observation, the $PF_{minmax}$ increases with energy up to $\sim100\%$ in the 10-30 keV band, while the $PF_{rms}$ remains steady at $\sim60\%$. The PFS obtained at high luminosity shows evidence of an iron $K\alpha$ emission line but no indications of a cyclotron line.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to account for reionization of the early Universe, galaxies at that time must have had significantly higher escape fractions of Lyman Continuum (LyC) than observed in the present Universe. Any explanation invoked to explain LyC escape must agree with this dramatic cosmic evolution. Galaxy mergers are often suggested as such a regulating mechanism. They occur an order or magnitude more frequently at $z \ge 3$ than in the local Universe, and they can trigger LyC escape either by inducing strong nuclear starbursts, or by tidally displacing the neutral ISM from the bulk of the stars. In the local Universe, LyC escape has been found to correlate with a range of physical and observable properties closely associated with strong star formation. For this reason, interest in mergers as drivers of LyC escape have been mainly focused on their capacity to induce strong star formation. However, at $z \ge 2$, these correlations are weaker, and we observe a much more diverse Lyman Continuum Emitter (LCE) population. This suggests that processes external to the LCE galaxies are more important for facilitating the escape at higher redshifts, which makes tidal displacement an interesting explanatory model; however, this has only been conclusively observed once before. In this letter, we present archival JWST/NIRSpec IFU and HST UVIS and IR imaging observations of the z = 3 Lyman-Continuum emitter LACES104037. We find that its Lyman-Continuum escape originates in a tidal bridge in the direction towards an interacting companion galaxy first identified in this work. LyC escape from tidal stripping or in-situ formed stars in tidal features could help explain both the higher cosmic LyC escape fraction and the greater diversity of LCE galaxy properties at higher redshifts.
#### Detection of dark companions via the combination of eclipse timing variation, Hipparcos and/or Gaia astrometry: the cases of V Puppis and CY Ari

 - **Abstract**
 The third body is expected to shape the formation and evolution of close binary systems. In this work, we develop a method to detect and characterize the tertiary companion around eclipsing binaries through the combined analysis of eclipse timing variation, Hipparcos and/or Gaia astrometry. This method allows us to determine both the true mass and the inclination of the tertiary body that inferred from light-travel time effect. For the massive B-type binary V Pup, we do not confirm the previously reported 5.47-yr signal; instead, we identify a longer period of 14 yr. The orbital semi-major axis and mass of the outer body are revised to $a_C={17.88}_{-0.15}^{+0.15}$\,au and $M_C={7.73}_{-0.14}^{+0.14}\,M_\odot$, confirming it as a promising stellar-mass black-hole candidate for further follow-up study. For the tertiary of the contact binary CY Ari, we obtain $P_C=5.406_{-0.016}^{+0.017}$ yr, $e_C=0.526_{-0.027}^{+0.032}$, $I_C={85.6}_{-6.5}^{+7.8}$$^\circ$, and a true mass of $M_C=0.640_{-0.029}^{+0.029}\,M_\odot$, supporting the white dwarf hypothesis proposed in previous study. The orbits of both systems are nearly edge-on ($I=90^{\circ}$), implying that they may form in a coplanar environment. We highlight the advantages of our method for detecting dark companions in binary and triple systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Spiral structures are one of the most common features in galaxies, yet their origins and evolution remain debated. Stellar age distributions offer crucial insights into galaxy evolution and star formation, though environmental effects can obscure the intrinsic age patterns. Using the Auriga cosmological gravo-magnetohydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, we investigate the azimuthal age distribution of young stars (<2 Gyr) in a sample of five Milky Way-mass spiral galaxies over the past 5 Gyr. We quantify the age gradients across spiral arms using the mean age offset (${\Delta}{\tau}$) and the non-overlap fraction ($f_{non-overlap}$). We further analyse the impact of mergers and fly-by events on the age gradients. Our results show that Auriga spiral galaxies generally feature younger stars in their leading edges compared to the trailing edges, with a typical ${\Delta}{\tau}$ between 30 and 80 Myr. However, gas-rich interactions can disrupt this age offset, resulting in similar age distributions on each side of the spiral arms. In three snapshots, we observe similar mean ages on both sides of spiral arms but differing age distribution broadness, coinciding with satellite interactions crossing the host galaxy's disc plane. Our simulation data suggest that the typical azimuthal age variation recovers within ~600 Myr after galaxy interactions. This work highlights the transient role of environmental interactions in shaping spiral arm age patterns.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) represent the closest and most accessible laboratories to study sustained super-Eddington accretion onto compact objects. Over the past decade, the discoveries of coherent pulsations in a few ULXs has proved that these systems can be powered by accreting neutron stars, while the most luminous and distant ones remain strong candidates for hosting intermediate-mass black holes. Despite the increasing number of available X-ray data and the significant progress in theoretical modeling and simulations, our understanding of ULXs remains incomplete. Key open questions include the nature and mass distribution of the compact objects, the type of the donor stars, the geometry of the accretion disc and its contribution to the observed broadband emission, the mechanisms responsible for the wide spectral and temporal phenomenology, the duration of the super-Eddington accretion phase and its feedback on the host-galaxy environment. Future ground-based facilities will play a crucial role in addressing these issues.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The bi-modality in the distribution of galaxies usually obtained from colour-colour or colour-stellar mass diagrams has been studied to show the difference between the galaxies in the blue cloud and in the red sequence and to define the green valley region. As a transition region, the green valley galaxies can give clues about morphological transformation of galaxies from late- to early-types, and therefore the selection of green valley is of fundamental importance. Aims: In this work, for the first time, we evaluate the selection effects of the most used green valley selection criteria. The aim is to understand how these criteria affect the identification of green valley galaxies, their properties, and their impact on galaxy evolution studies. Methods: Using the SDSS optical and GALEX ultraviolet data at redshift z < 0.1, we selected the eight most commonly used criteria based on colours, specific star formation rate, and star formation rate vs. stellar mass. We then studied the properties of the green valley galaxies (their stellar mass, star formation rate, specific star formation rate, intrinsic brightness, morphological and pectroscopic types) for each selection criterion. Results: We found that when using different criteria, we select different types of galaxies. UV-optical colour-based criteria tend to select more massive galaxies, with lower star formation rates, with higher fractions of composite and elliptical galaxies, than when using pure optical colours. Our results also show that the colour-based criteria are the most sensitive to galaxy properties, rapidly changing the selection of green valley galaxies. Conclusions: Whenever possible, we suggest avoiding the green valley colour-based selection and using other methods or a combination of several, such as the star formation rate vs. stellar mass or specific star formation rate.
