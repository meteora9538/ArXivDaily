 - **Abstract**
 Many stars -- if they could be imaged with enough angular resolution -- would exhibit features expected from theory but not possible to extract from spectra. We may group these by increasing complexity as follows. First, smooth variations in brightness across the surface, resembling solar limb darkening but much more prominent and involving more processes in stars with fast spin or external tides. Next, there are periodic features: not only oscillations, but also convective cells and starspots, which appear to transit across a star as its spins, and exoplanets that really do transit across the star. Then, there are transients like flares. Current optical interferometers provide synthetic apertures of a few hundred metres and angular resolutions down to about nanoradian ($\simeq 0.2\,$milliarcsecond), enough to resolve some of the above features on the nearest upper main-sequence stars, giants and supergiants. Ongoing projects aims to km-scale synthetic apertures, enough to measure the radius of the nearest white dwarf. In this White Paper we briefly discuss what could be observed with synthetic apertures over $\sim20\,$km -- resolving detail on white dwarfs at the level currently possible on supergiants.
#### MIRACLE III. JWST/MIRI expose the hidden role of the AGN outflow in NGC 1068

 - **Abstract**
 We present new JWST IFS observations of the active galaxy NGC 1068, combining Mid-IR and optical IFS data from MIRI and MUSE to characterize the multi-phase circumnuclear gas properties and its interaction with the AGN outflow and radio jet. MIRI data trace the multiphase gas emission up to 400 pc from the nucleus at 20--60 pc resolution, unveiling a clumpy ionized structure around the radio hot-spots and a rotating warm molecular disc. Innovative Mid-IR diagnostic diagrams highlight the role of the AGN as the main excitation source for the ionized gas in the entire MIRI field of view, consistent with optical diagnostics, and supporting the AGN-driven wind scenario. Density sensitive [NeV] and [ArV] Mid-IR transitions reveal high-density clumps (n_e > 10**4 cm**-3) along the edges of the jet and outflow, tracing gas compression by the expanding wind. We combined multi-cloud kinematic (MOKA) and photo-ionization (HOMERUN) modeling to characterize the ionized outflow properties and found that [OIV] traces an outflow 300 km/s faster than that inferred from [OIII], showing that the two lines originate from distinct gas components. This kinematic dichotomy is confirmed by the photoionization analysis, which requires a dust-poor component dominating the optical lines and a dust-rich component responsible for the Mid-IR emission. The Mid-IR-revealed dusty component carries a significantly larger ionized-gas mass than what can be inferred from optical lines alone, showing that most of the outflowing mass is hidden from classical optical diagnostics. Our modelling point to a two-stage acceleration scenario, with velocities up to ~2000 km/s, consistent with an energy-driven wind. Our findings indicates that the outflow entrains up to a few 10**6 solar masses of ionized gas and couples efficiently with the surrounding ISM, injecting turbulence and impacting the host-galaxy environment.

 - **Abstract**
 The center of the Galaxy harbors a supermassive black hole, Sgr\,A*, which is surrounded by a massive star cluster known as the S-cluster. The most extensively studied star in this cluster is the B-type main-sequence S2 star (also known as S0-2). These types of stars are commonly found in binary systems in the Galactic field, but observations do not seem to detect a companion to S2. This absence may be attributed to observational biases or to a dynamically hostile environment caused by phenomena such as tidal disruption or mergers. Using a $N$-body code with first-order post-Newtonian corrections, we investigate whether S2 can host a stellar or planetary companion. We perform $10^{5}$ simulations adopting uniform distributions for the orbital elements of the companion. Our results show that companions may exist for orbital periods shorter than 100~days, eccentricities below 0.8, and across the full range of mutual inclinations. The number of surviving companions increases with shorter orbital periods, lower eccentricities, and nearly coplanar orbits. We also find that the disruption mechanisms include mergers driven by Lidov-Kozai cycles and breakups that occur when the companion surpasses the Hill radius of its orbit. Finally, we find that the presence of a companion would alter S2's astrometric signal by no more than $ 5\,\mu{\rm as}$. Current radial-velocity detection limits constrain viable stellar binary configurations to approximately 4.4\% of the simulated cases. Including astrometric limits reduces to 4.3\%. Imposing an additional constraint that any companion must have a mass $\lesssim 2\,M_{\odot}$ (otherwise it would be visible) narrows the fraction of undetectable stellar binaries to just 3.0\%.
#### Balmer Transition Signatures from Gas-Enshrouded, Dust-Poor Active Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently discovered by JWST, show distinctive Balmer-transition features, including prominent Balmer absorption, pronounced Balmer breaks, and large equivalent widths of broad $\mathrm{H}\alpha$ emission, all of which indicate the presence of dense gas surrounding their central black holes. A further key property of LRDs is their large Balmer decrements with broad $\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\beta$ line-flux ratios far exceeding the Case B recombination value. These ratios of $\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\beta>3$ have often been interpreted as evidence for heavy dust extinction ($A_V\gtrsim 3$ mag), however such dust would inevitably produce strong near-to-mid infrared re-emission that is hardly seen in JWST/MIRI observations. To investigate the physical origin of these observed Balmer features, we perform radiation transfer calculations through dust-free, dense gas. We show that the observed large Balmer decrements ($\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\beta$ and $\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\gamma$) naturally arise from Balmer resonance scattering without invoking dust. At sufficiently high densities ($n_\mathrm{H} \gtrsim 10^{{8}-{10}}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), the elevated multiple Balmer-line ratios converge to values that closely mimic dust reddening, explaining why LRD spectra resemble obscured AGNs. Furthermore, when the Balmer break and broad Balmer lines originate in the same dense gas, their strengths are physically linked, allowing us to constrain the density structure and infer a low broad-line region gas mass of $\sim O(10~M_\odot)$. Such a small gas reservoir would be enriched by even a single supernova, implying that LRDs with observed low-metallicity signatures likely experienced minimal star formation in their nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide energetic feedback necessary to `turn off' star formation in high-mass galaxies (M$_{\rm halo} \geq $ 10$^{12.5}$ M$_{\odot}$, $10.4 \leq \log(\frac{M_*}{M_\odot}) \leq 11$) as observed. Cosmic rays (CRs) have been proposed as a promising channel of AGN feedback, but the nature of CR feedback from AGN remains uncertain. We analyze a set of high-resolution simulations of massive galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-3) project including multi-channel AGN feedback, explicitly evolving kinetic/mechanical, radiative, and spectrally-resolved CRs from the central black hole. Specifically, we explore different CR feedback and transport assumptions, calibrated to Milky Way local ISM constraints, and compare them to observed galaxy scaling relations. We find that all parameterizations explored self-regulate within agreement with observed galaxy scaling relations, demonstrating that CR injection efficiencies varied by $\sim$1.5 dex and locally-variable transport produce quenched galaxies with reasonable bulk properties; however, they feature orders-of-magnitude variant circumgalactic medium (CGM) gas properties. Our results indicate that multi-wavelength synthetic observations probing these varied halo properties from larger simulated samples in conjunction with observational comparisons may place novel constraints on how AGN physically quench star formation in massive galaxies.
#### Connection Between Dwarf Galaxies and Globular Clusters: Insights from the Perseus Cluster Using Subaru Imaging and Keck Spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic study of 189 dwarf galaxies and their globular cluster (GC) systems in the Perseus cluster, based on deep Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging and Keck spectroscopy, supplemented by literature data. This constitutes the largest sample of dwarfs in a single galaxy cluster to date with simultaneous deep imaging, spectroscopic coverage, and GC measurements, while uniquely spanning a broad and continuous range of galaxy properties. We find an anti-correlation between GC specific mass and galaxy stellar mass for dwarfs in Perseus similar to observations in other clusters. At fixed stellar mass, dwarfs with lower surface brightness or larger effective radius tend to be more GC-rich -- suggesting either high GC formation efficiency in an earlier compact-galaxy phase, or less efficient GC disruption. The correlation between GC richness and axis ratio in Perseus is weaker than in other environments. We find some connection between GC richness and infall time, but not with the clear correlations found in Virgo, Coma, and cosmological simulations. More complete observations are needed to test for cluster-to-cluster variations in galaxy and GC evolutionary histories. This work demonstrates the potential of new wide-field imaging and spectroscopy surveys for understanding GCs and dwarf galaxies, and highlights the need for further work in theoretical modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 In the exascale computing era, handling and analyzing massive datasets have become extremely challenging. In situ analysis, which processes data during simulation runtime and bypasses costly intermediate I/O steps, offers a promising solution. We present libyt (this https URL), an open-source C library that enables astrophysical simulations to analyze and visualize data in parallel computation with yt or other Python packages. libyt can invoke Python routines automatically or provide interactive entry points via a Python prompt or a Jupyter Notebook. It requires minimal intervention in researchers' workflow, allowing users to reuse job submission scripts and Python routines. We describe libyt's architecture for parallel computing in high-performance computing environments, including its bidirectional connection between simulation codes and Python, and its integration into the Jupyter ecosystem. We detail its methods for reading AMR simulations and handling in-memory data with minimal overhead, and procedures for yielding data when requested by Python. We describe how libyt maps simulation data to yt frontends, allowing post-processing scripts to be converted into in situ analysis with just two lines of change. We document libyt's API and demonstrate its integration into two astrophysical simulation codes, GAMER and Enzo, using examples including core-collapse supernovae, isolated dwarf galaxies, fuzzy dark matter, the Sod shock tube test, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and the AGORA galaxy simulation. Finally, we discuss libyt's performance, limitations related to data redistribution, extensibility, architecture, and comparisons with traditional post-processing approaches.

 - **Abstract**
 Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are among the densest stellar environments in the universe. In these environments, collisions can shape the stellar mass function and produce exotic stellar populations. In this work, we investigate how stellar collisions couple with stellar evolution in the inner parsec of an NSC. We simulate the evolution of a sample of $1000$ $1$ $M_\odot$ stars embedded in a uniform cluster of dynamically relaxed 0.5 $M_\odot$ stars. Using COSMIC to evolve stellar properties in time , we track the mass, radius, and evolutionary state of the stars as they collide in the cluster. Our results show that most stars within $0.1$~pc of the SMBH experience a collision while on the main-sequence. However, outside of this distance, stars collide during the red giant phase, when the stellar radius increases dramatically. We find that the most common type of collision -- main-sequence or red giant -- over the lifetime of the cluster depends on the steepness of the stellar cusp, which determines the spatial distribution of the stars in the cluster. These results show that stellar evolution plays a fundamental role in shaping the collisional history of stars in nuclear star clusters. Lastly, we consider whether the closest known stars to the Milky Way's SMBH have experienced a collision. We estimate that several of the S-stars have a high probability of experiencing a collision over their main-sequence lifetime, perhaps with implications for their observed youth and properties.
#### Kennicutt-Schmidt relation of galaxies over 13 billion years in the COLIBRE hydrodynamical simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the correlation between star formation rate (SFR) surface density and gas surface density (known as the Kennicutt-Schmidt, KS, relation) at kiloparsec (kpc) scales across cosmic time ($0\le z \le 8$) using the COLIBRE state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. These simulations feature on-the-fly non-equilibrium chemistry coupled to dust grain evolution and detailed radiative cooling down to $\approx 10$~K, enabling direct predictions for the atomic (HI) and molecular (H$_2$) KS relations. At $z\approx 0$, COLIBRE reproduces the observed (spatially-resolved) KS relations for HI and H$_2$, including the associated scatter, which we predict to be significantly correlated with stellar surface density, local specific SFR (sSFR), and gas metallicity. We show that the HI KS relation steepens for lower-mass galaxies, while the H$_2$ KS relation shifts to higher normalisation in galaxies with higher sSFRs. The H$_2$ depletion time decreases by a factor of $\approx 20$ from $z = 0$ to $z = 8$, primarily due to the decreasing gas-phase metallicity. This results in less H$_2$ and more HI being associated with a given SFR at higher redshift. We also find that galaxies with higher sSFRs have a larger molecular gas content and higher star formation efficiency per unit gas mass on kpc scales. The predicted evolution of the H$_2$ depletion time and its correlation with a galaxy's sSFR agree remarkably well with observations in a wide redshift range, $0\le z\le 5$.
#### Varying core-envelope coupling efficiency identified from stellar rotation--activity relation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11376

 - **Abstract**
 Core-envelope coupling provides a reasonable explanation of the spin-down stalling of stars in open clusters, which was not predicted by classical gyrochronology. However, it remains an open question whether the coupling efficiency is constant or variable. M dwarfs, possessing thicker convective envelopes and thus longer coupling timescales than other late-type stars, are ideal objects for this investigation. In this letter, we present a new analysis using LAMOST and DESI spectra to construct the rotation--activity ($R_{\rm{HK}}^{'}$--Ro) relation for M dwarfs. The new relation consists of three distinct regimes of fast, intermediate, and slow rotation, closely matching the three sequences of gyrochronology, namely the ``Convective'' sequence, ``Gap'', and ``Interface'' sequence. Our study reveals, for the first time, a variable activity decay rate in the intermediate-rotation regime (i.e., the ``Gap'' region). This implies a varying core-envelope coupling efficiency, peaking towards the end of this region. It also coincides with the well-known stage of stalled stellar spin-down.
#### Observational evidence of tidal torque in the primordial Universe

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal torque theory (TTT) predicts that galaxy angular momenta are imprinted by the early tidal field acting on their proto-structures, which are preserved through cosmic evolution and provide the potentially most precise measurement of the early universe. We test this prediction using the gas component of central massive elliptical galaxies, whose angular momenta respond sensitively to external torques. By comparing the observed gas angular momentum vectors with those predicted from the primordial density field reconstructed by ELUCID for the nearby universe, we conclusively detect a strong direction correlation with a significance of about $7\sigma$. These results provide the first robust observational confirmation of TTT and open a new window for cosmological measurements of neutrino mass and other cosmological parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the roles of the three competitors, namely, gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields, in controlling star formation (SF) within dense, massive clumps identified in the ATLASGAL survey. By examining scaling relations, virial parameters, and turbulent energy spectra, we evaluate the dynamical state of these clumps. We observe a weak velocity dispersion-size relation (sigma proportional to L^0.11), which is much shallower than the classical Larson-like relations, suggesting that turbulence does not mainly drive internal dynamics. The turbulent energy spectrum, E(k) proportional to k^-1.21, is also less steep than what is expected for both incompressible and compressible turbulence. We equally observe a decreasing trend in the virial parameter with increasing mass (alpha_vir proportional to M^-0.37), indicating that more massive clumps are increasingly gravitationally bound. These trends indicate an increasing relative dominance of gravity over turbulence at smaller scales, aligning with multiscale collapse scenarios; however, the absolute energy balance remains unquantifiable with the current data. Although magnetic fields are not directly measured, their potential influence is considered in the interpretation of pressure balance and dynamical support. Our findings imply that gravitational processes appear to primarily regulate the structure and evolution of massive clumps.
#### Dynamical evolution of massless particles in star clusters with NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS: II. The long-term evolution of free-floating comets

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Comets, asteroids, planetesimals, free-floating planets and brown dwarfs, are continuously injected into the intra-cluster environment after expulsion from their host planetary systems or binary system. The dynamics of large populations of such free-floating comets (ffcs) in a star cluster environment is not yet fully understood. Aims. We investigate the dynamical evolution of comet populations in star clusters, and characterize the kinematics and ejection rates of ffc in a star cluster. Moreover, we determine whether a different initial energy distribution affects the mass segregation of the less massive population. Methods. We carry out simulations using the N-body code NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS (Flammini Dotti et al. 2025), which allows fast integration of star clusters that contain large numbers of massless particles, to characterize the dynamics of populations of low-mass particles with sub-virial and super-virial distributions. Results. Comets do not participate in the mass segregation process, similarly to planet-size objects, regardless of their initial energy distribution. The latter is slightly changing the whole dynamical evolution at the start of the simulation. We only observe an initial relaxation or collapse of the objects for super-virial and sub-virial ratios, respectively. The external regions of the ffcs population tend to be pulled back in the cluster core at the end of the simulation, suggesting the gravitational pull of the stars is pulling them back in the core. This phenomenon occurs at later times if the system in virial equilibrium. Compared to less massive bodies, brown dwarfs experiences more mass segregation the inner regions tend to be more mixed with the stellar population

 We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the counterpart of EP240801a, at z=1.67, the first fast X-ray transient (FXT) identified as an X-ray flash (XRF) by the Einstein Probe (EP) and Fermi-GBM. Our observations reveal strong photometric and spectroscopic evidence for an associated broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN) SN 2024aihh, the most distant spectroscopically identified gamma ray-burst (GRB)-SN to date. The SN exhibits similar luminosity and light curve evolution to the proto-type GRB-SN 1998bw with an absolute magnitude of the SN at $\sim$23 days rest-frame of $M_{F140W} \approx$-19 mag. The SN is located in a host galaxy with complex morphology at a large ($\sim$6 kpc) offset in a region of relatively low surface brightness. The region around the SN has a modest star formation rate and is dominated by an intermediate mass-weighted age (1.4$\pm$0.3 Gyr) population, despite the apparent presence of a young, massive broad-lined Type Ic SN progenitor. These observations demonstrate that observations with HST and JWST can greatly extend the redshift range over which the GRB/FXT-SN connection can be studied, including in relatively low luminosity, X-ray rich events. They demonstrate little apparent evolution in the SN properties from local examples despite EP240801a originating from an epoch 10 Gyr ago.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the spatially resolved star formation, gas ionisation, and outflow properties of 1813 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the MaNGA survey, which we classify into infrared (IR), broad-line (BL), narrow-line (NL), and radio (RD) AGNs based on their mid-infrared colours, optical spectra, and/or radio photometry. We also provide estimations of AGN power at different wavelengths. AGN incidence is found to increase with stellar mass following a power-law, with the high-mass end dominated by RDAGNs and the low-mass end dominated by NLAGNs. Compared to their mass-matched non-AGN counterparts, we find that IRAGNs, BLAGNs, and NLAGNs on average show enhanced specific star formation rates, younger stellar populations, and harder ionisation towards the centre. RDAGNs, in contrast, show radial profiles similar to quiescent galaxies. [OIII] outflows are more common and stronger in BL/IRAGNs, while RDAGNs on average show no outflow features. The outflow incidence increases with [OIII] luminosity, and the features in BL/IRAGNs on average extend to ~2 kpc from the nuclei. We further discuss a possible evolutionary sequence of AGNs and their host galaxies, where AGNs with strong emission lines or dust tori are present in star-forming galaxies. Later, young compact radio jets emerge, the host galaxies gradually quench, and the AGN hosts eventually evolve into globally quiescent systems with larger radio jets that prevent further gas cooling.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: This paper presents new results from the ESO Large Programme Looking into the faintEst WIth MUSE (LEWIS). The sample consists of low-surface brightness (LSB) and ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) located inside 0.4 R$_{vir}$ of the Hydra I cluster. Integral field spectroscopy is acquired for 24 galaxies with the MUSE spectrograph mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Aims: Our main objective is to analyse possible correlations between the environment and the integrated stellar population properties. Methods: For each galaxy, we extract the 1D stacked spectrum in an aperture of one effective radius and adopt previously published stellar kinematics to derive age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] through a full spectral fitting technique. Results: We find that the analysed LEWIS sample has a mean metallicity of [M/H] = -0.9 dex, a mean age of 10 Gyr, comparable to results of UDGs in other clusters. According to the projected phase-space, galaxies can be classified into two groups: early infallers, with slightly higher metallicities ([M/H]$_{early} = -0.8 \pm 0.1$ dex), and late infallers, with slightly lower values ([M/H]$_{late} = -1.0 \pm 0.1$ dex). Two types of galaxies are found in the early-infall region: half of them have metallicities consistent with the dwarf mass-metallicity relation, while the other half show higher values. Moreover, they display different timescales for stellar mass assembly. Conclusions: We identified different classes of UDGs in the Hydra I cluster, which suggest different formation mechanisms taking place. Almost all of the UDGs and LSBs in the cluster are consistent with the puffed-up dwarf formation scenario, having dwarf-like metallicities and being consistent with the dwarf mass-metallicity relation. In the innermost regions of the cluster, where metal-richer UDGs lie, tidal or environmental effects might have influenced their formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy of GLIMPSE-16043, a promising $z\sim6$ Pop III candidate originally identified through NIRCam photometry as having weak [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ emission. Our follow-up reveals clear [OIII] emission, ruling out a genuine zero-metallicity nature. However, the combination of the measured line fluxes and photometry indicates that its spectral energy distribution requires an extraordinarily strong Balmer jump ($-1.66 \pm 0.47$ mag) and H$\alpha$ equivalent width ($3750\pm1800$ Å), features that cannot be reproduced by current stellar+nebular or pure nebular photoionization models. The only models approaching the observations to almost within $1\sigma$ involve a hot ($T_{\rm eff}\!\simeq\!10^{4.7}$ K) single blackbody embedded in a low-$T_{\rm e}$ nebular environment, suggestive of scenarios such as a tidal-disruption event or a microquasar with strong disk winds. This cautions that photometric Pop~III selections are vulnerable to contamination when the rest-frame optical continuum is undetected. Motivated by this, we refine the photometric Pop III selection criteria to exclude the locus of extreme Balmer-jump objects. The revised criteria also recover the recently reported spectroscopic candidate AMORE6, demonstrating that the updated selection preserves sensitivity to genuine Pop III-like sources while removing key contaminants. Applying the refined criteria across legacy survey fields and five newly released CANUCS lensing cluster fields, we revisit the Pop III UV luminosity function and estimate the Pop III cosmic star-formation rate density to be $\approx[10^{-6}$--$10^{-4}]$~$M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$~cMpc$^{-3}$ at $z\simeq6$--7, falling in the range of current theoretical predictions.
