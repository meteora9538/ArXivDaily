 - **Abstract**
 SRGt 062340.2-265751, a cataclysmic variable identified by SRG/eROSITA due to its significant X-ray variability, remains poorly characterised despite multi-wavelength follow-up. We present spectral and timing analyses from the first dedicated X-ray and ultraviolet observations with XMM-Newton, complemented by SRG/eROSITA data from four all-sky surveys (eRASS1-4) and ASAS-SN optical photometry. Our timing analysis reveals a >8$\sigma$-significant modulation at 3.6 $\pm$ 0.5 hours, likely representing the orbital period. Long-term ASAS-SN monitoring confirms the source as a VY Sculptoris-type nova-like system, while short-timescale X-ray and ultraviolet variability, down to a few minutes, suggests a possible underlying magnetic white dwarf. Two additional significant X-ray modulations at 43 $\pm$ 1 min and 36.0 $\pm$ 0.7 min tentatively point to the spin period of an intermediate polar. The best-fit XMM-Newton energy spectra reveal a multi-temperature thermal plasma ($kT$ = 0.23, 0.94, and 5.2 keV), while the SRG/eROSITA spectra are consistent with a single-temperature thermal plasma of a few keV. We estimate unabsorbed X-ray luminosities of $\gtrsim$$10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (0.2-12 keV). Broadband spectral energy distribution modelling, from near-ultraviolet to infrared, indicates a disc-dominated system consistent with a nova-like classification. We discuss these results in the context of the source's confirmed nova-like classification and its possible magnetic nature, a scenario increasingly supported by discoveries of intermediate polars exhibiting VY Sculptoris-type nova-like features.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to measure the evolution of individual galaxies around the Star Formation Main Sequence (SFMS) during the last Gyr as a function of their stellar mass to quantify how much of its scatter is due to short-term this http URL derived star formation histories using full spectral fitting for a sample of 8,960 galaxies from the MaNGA survey to track the position of the galaxies in the SFMS during the last this http URL variability correlates with both the stellar mass of the galaxies and their current position in both the SFMS and the mass-metallicity relation (MZR), with the position in the latter strongly affecting variability in SFR. While most of the fluctuations are compatible with stochasticity, there is a very weak but statistically significant preference for $\sim135-150$ Myr time-scales. These results support a strong self-regulation of SFR within galaxies, establishing characteristic intensities and time-scales for bursts of star formation and quenching episodes. We also find that short-term variability cannot account for the entirety of the scatter in the SFMS. It appears to originate to a similar degree in short-term variability and long-term (halo-level) differentiation and fits predictions from models.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometric perturbations of lensed arcs behind galaxy clusters have been recently suggested as promising probes of small-scale ($\lesssim10^9 M_{\odot}$) dark matter substructure. Populations of cold dark matter (CDM) subhalos, predicted in hierarchical structure formation theory, can break the symmetry of arcs near the critical curve, leading to positional shifts in the observed images. We present a novel statistical method to constrain the average subhalo mass fraction ($f_{\rm sub}$) in clusters that takes advantage of this induced positional asymmetry. Focusing on CDM, we extend a recent semi-analytic model of subhalo tidal evolution to accurately simulate realistic subhalos within a cluster-scale host. We simulate the asymmetry of lensed arcs from these subhalo populations using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Using mock data, we demonstrate that our method can reliably recover the simulated $f_{\rm sub}$ to within 68\% CI in 73\% of cases, regardless of the lens model, astrometric precision, and image morphology. We show that the constraining power of our method is optimized for larger samples of well observed arcs, ideal for recent JWST observations of cluster lenses. As a preliminary test, we apply our method to the MACSJ0416 Warhol arc and AS1063 System 1. For Warhol we constrain the upper limit on $\log f_{\rm sub} < -3.40^{+1.06}_{-0.97}$, while for AS1063 System 1 we constrain $\log f_{\rm sub} = -2.36^{+0.56}_{-0.89}$ (both at 68\% CI), consistent with CDM predictions. We elaborate on our method's limitations and its future potential to place stringent constraints on dark matter properties in cluster environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a hybridized unsupervised clustering algorithm Hisaxy as a novel way to identify frequently occurring magnetic structures embedded in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) carried by the solar wind. The Hisaxy algorithm utilizes a combination of indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (iSAX) and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to efficiently identify clusters of patterns embedded in time series data. We utilized Hisaxy to identify small-scale structures, known as discontinuities, embedded in time series measurements of the IMF. In doing so, we demonstrate the capability of the algorithm to significantly reduce the amount of human analysis hours required to identify these structures, all the while maintaining a high degree of self similarity within a given cluster of time series data.

 - **Abstract**
 Positioned at geostationary orbit (GEO) ~36,000 km above Earth, NOAA's GOES series has recorded real-time energetic proton flux measurements crucial for space weather monitoring for over three decades. Although machine learning models have advanced solar energetic particle (SEP) event prediction using GOES data, the sudden yet sparse nature of SEP events necessitates high-quality proton flux measurements. Previous studies have identified contamination issues in GOES data, when the presence of higher-energy protons can cause parasitic signals in lower-energy GOES channels and lead to artificially elevated fluxes in lower energy ranges (e.g., 10 - 50 MeV). As of now, no universal correction method has been implemented for the publicly available NOAA data. In addition, the effects of Earth's magnetosphere on the 10 - 50 MeV particles are not fully understood yet. This study assesses a reconstruction method using concurrent solar proton event (SPE) measurements from SOHO-EPHIN, which align well with GOES measurements of SPEs across solar cycles 23 and the bulk of cycle 24, but represent the off-magnetospheric environment of the Lagrange 1 point. We train regression models on GOES proton fluxes across multiple energy bins, employing EPHIN fluxes as prediction targets. We expect that similar approaches can allow us to derive non-contaminated flux proxies that preserve valuable data and more accurately capture the characteristics of SPEs, providing a more stable dataset for analyzing SEP behavior and potentially improving SEP event prediction models.
#### Unveiling the Nature of Superorbital Modulation of SMC X-1 using NinjaSat

 - **Abstract**
 We report a long-term, high-cadence timing and spectral observation of the X-ray pulsar SMC X-1 using NinjaSat, a 6U CubeSat in low-Earth orbit, covering nearly a full superorbital cycle. SMC X-1 is a high-mass X-ray binary exhibiting a 0.7 s X-ray pulsar and a non-stationary superorbital modulation with periods ranging from approximately 40 to 65 days. Its peak luminosity of $1.3\times10^{39}$~\lumcgs\ makes it a local analogue of ultraluminous X-ray pulsars powered by supercritical accretion. We find that the spin-up rate during the high state remains consistent with the long-term average, with no significant correlation between spin-up rate and flux. This result indicates that the modulation is primarily geometric rather than accretion-driven. The hardness ratio and spectral shape are stable throughout the entire superorbital cycle, supporting obscuration by optically thick material or energy-independent scattering. In addition, the 2--20 keV pulse profile varies with superorbital phase, which may be explained either by variable covering fraction due to geometric obscuration, or by free precession of the neutron star. This represents the first complete measurement of spin-up rate and spectral evolution across a single superorbital cycle in SMC X-1, highlighting the scientific capability of CubeSat-based observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 The most luminous and obscured quasars (QSOs) detected in infrared all-sky surveys could represent a key co-evolutionary phase from nuclear to circum-galactic (CG) scales in the formation of massive galaxies. In this context, Hot Dust Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) at z ~2-4 provide a unique opportunity to study the link between cosmic mass assembly and nuclear accretion in high-z luminous QSOs/galaxies. W0410-0913 (hereafter W0410-09) is a luminous ($\rm ~L_{\rm bol} \sim 6.4 \times10^{47} \rm erg\ s^{-1}$) obscured QSO at z = 3.631, with a 30 kpc CG Ly$\alpha$ nebula (CGLAN), smaller than the ~ 100 kpc nebulae around unobscured Type-I QSOs, and an exceptional overdense environment of ~ 19 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) within 300 kpc and $\pm$ 200 $\rm km ~s^{-1}$ of the Hot DOG. We aim to detect and characterize nuclear accretion in W0410-09 and its environment. Exploiting a deep proprietary ~280 ks Chandra observation, using empirical and physically motivated models for obscured sources, we show that W0410-09 exhibits Compton-thick obscuration ($\rm~ N_H > 10^{24} \rm cm^{-2}$) and high intrinsic luminosity ($\rm ~L_{2-10} > 10^{45} \rm erg ~s^{-1}$), making it one of the most luminous obscured QSOs at z $>$ 3.5. With the exclusion of W0410-09 we do not detect X-ray emission from any of the 19 LAEs, except for a 3$\sigma$ signal in the 6-7 keV rest-frame band, interpreted as Fe K$\alpha$ emission, suggesting the presence of heavily obscured yet undetected AGN emission in several LAEs. Including W0410-09, the estimated AGN fraction is $f_{\rm AGN}^{\rm LAE} = 5^{+12}_{-4}$%, potentially up to ~35% if unresolved obscured AGN are considered as suggested by the Fe K$\alpha$ line detection. We conclude that W0410-09 is in a critical transitional blow-out phase, during which powerful QSO-driven outflows are clearing the nuclear obscuration, ultimately leading to an unobscured luminous quasar.
#### Quokka-based understanding of outflows (QED) - IV. Limitations of H$α$ as an outflow diagnostic

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of broad wings in the H$\alpha$} line is commonly used as a diagnostic of the presence and properties of galactic winds from star-forming galaxies. However, the accuracy of this approach has not been subjected to extensive testing. In this paper, we use high-resolution simulations of galactic wind launching to calibrate the extent to which broad H$\alpha$} wings can be used to infer the properties of galactic outflows. For this purpose, we analyse a series of high-resolution wind simulations from the QED suite spanning two orders of magnitude in star formation surface density ($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$). We show that the broad component of H$\alpha$} emission correlates well with the wind mass flux at heights $\sim1$ kpc above the galactic plane, but that the correlation is poor at larger distances from the plane, and that even at 1 kpc the relationship between mass flux and surface brightness of broad H$\alpha$} is significantly sub-linear. The sub-linear scaling suggests that the electron column density in the wind increases systematically with outflow strength, and that the conventional assumption of constant electron density in the wind leads to a systematic overestimate of how steeply mass loading factors depend on $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$. We provide empirical scaling relations that observers can apply to correct for this effect when converting H$\alpha$} measurements to mass outflow rates. Finally, we use synthetic observations of the density-diagnostic $[\mathrm{S_{II}}]\,\lambda\lambda6716,6731$ doublet to show that using this diagnostic only slightly improves estimates of wind outflow rates compared to the naive assumption of constant electron density, and performs significantly worse than the empirical correlation we provide.

 - **Abstract**
 PSR J1928+1815, the first recycled pulsar-helium (He) star binary discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, consists of a 10.55 ms pulsar and a companion star with mass $1-1.6\,M_{\sun}$ in a 0.15-day orbit. Theoretical studies suggest that this system originated from a neutron star (NS) intermediate-mass or high-mass X-ray binary that underwent common envelope (CE) evolution, leading to the successful ejection of the giant envelope. The traditional view is that hypercritical accretion during the CE phase may have recycled the NS. However, the specific mechanism responsible for accelerating its spin period remains uncertain due to the complex processes involved in CE this http URL this study, we investigate the influence of Roche lobe overflow (RLO) accretion that takes place prior to the CE phase on the spin evolution of NSs. Our primary objective is to clarify how this process affects the spin characteristics of pulsars. We utilized the stellar evolution code \texttt{MESA} and the binary population synthesis code \texttt{BSE} to model the formation and evolution of NS-He star binaries. We calculated the distributions of the orbital period, He star mass, NS spin period, and magnetic field for NS + He star systems in the Galaxy. Our results indicate that RLO accretion preceding the CE phase could spin up NSs to millisecond periods through super-Eddington accretion. Considering a range of CE efficiencies $\alpha_{\rm CE}$ from 0.3 to 3, we estimate the birthrate (total number) of NS + He star systems in our Galaxy to be 9.0$\times 10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ (626 systems) to 1.9$\times 10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$ (2684 systems).

 - **Abstract**
 Ram pressure stripping (RPS) plays a crucial role in shaping galaxy evolution in dense environments, yet its impact on the molecular and dusty phases of the interstellar medium remains poorly understood. We present JWST/NIRCam 3.3 micrometres PAH emission maps for the nine most striking RPS galaxies in the Abell 2744 cluster at redshift z_cl = 0.306, tracing the effects of environmental processes on small dust grains. Exploiting multi-band JWST/NIRCam and HST photometry, we perform spatially-resolved UV to mid-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, characterising stellar populations in both galactic disks and clumps detected in the stripped tails. We detect PAH_3.3 mission in eight of the nine galaxies at 5 sigma, with morphologies revealing disk truncation and elongation along the RPS direction. In three galaxies, PAH_3.3 emission is also found in star-forming clumps embedded in the stripped tails up to a distance of 40 kpc. Star formation rates inferred from PAH_3.3 emission agree with those derived from SED fitting averaged over the past 100 Myr within an intrinsic scatter of 0.4 dex, but the relation appears to be age dependent. The spatial correlation between PAH strength, stellar age, and SFR - consistent across disks and tails - demonstrates that PAH-carrying molecules can survive and be stripped by ram pressure. Finally, age gradients revealed by the SED fitting provide the first observational evidence outside the Local Universe for the fireball model of star formation in stripped clumps. This work represents the first detailed study of PAH emission in cluster galaxies, offering new insights into the fate of dust and star formation in extreme environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of GW231123, a gravitational-wave (GW) event with exceptionally massive and rapidly spinning black holes, suggests the possible formation within an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk, which provides a favorable environment for potentially generating an observable electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. We conduct a search for such a counterpart by crossmatching the GW localization with a comprehensive catalog of AGN flares from the Zwicky Transient Facility. Our analysis yields six plausible optical flare candidates that are spatially and temporally coincident with GW231123 and exhibit significant deviations from their AGN baseline flux. Although these candidates represent a crucial first step, their true nature remains inconclusive. Confirming any one of these flares via future observations would provide a landmark validation of the AGN formation channel and unlock the multi-messenger potential of this extraordinary merger.
#### Co-existence of Internal Gravity Waves and Tayler-Spruit Magnetic Fields in the Radiative Core of Low-mass Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The Tayler-Spruit dynamo (TSD) is able to generate a small-scale magnetic field in the differentially rotating stably stratified layers of stars and was recently observed in numerical simulations. In parallel, the propagation of internal gravity waves in stars can be modified in the presence of a magnetic field. Here we first want to estimate the interaction between a magnetic field generated by the TSD and internal gravity waves in the radiative core of low-mass stars. This allows us to then characterise the effect of this interplay on the observed standing modes spectrum and on the internal transport of angular momentum by progressive waves. To do this, we use the STAREVOL evolution code to compute the structure of low-mass rotating stars along their evolution. In particular, we implement a formalism to describe the TSD and estimate the regions where the generated magnetic field is strong enough to change the identity of internal gravity waves to magneto-gravity waves. In addition, we evaluate the possible limitation of angular momentum transport by the combined action of rotation and magnetism. We show that along the pre-main sequence and main-sequence evolution, the lowest frequencies of the excited gravity wave spectrum could be converted to magneto-gravity waves by the magnetic field generated by the TSD. During the red-giant branch we find that most of the excited spectrum of progressive internal gravity waves could be converted into magneto-gravity waves in the very central region.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the stellar mass function (SMF) of quiescent and star-forming galaxies and its dependence on morphology in 10 redshift bins at $0.2<z<5.5$ using the COSMOS2025 catalog built from $0.54 \, {\rm deg}^2$ JWST imaging from COSMOS-Web. Galaxies are selected by type using the $NUVrJ$ rest-frame color diagram and classified morphologically by bulge-to-total light ratio ($B/T$). The quiescent SMF shows rapid early build-up, with the most massive systems (${\rm log}(M_{\star}/{\rm M_{\odot}})\gtrsim11$) assembled by $z\sim1$ and evolving little since. The star-forming SMF evolves more slowly, following a mass-evolution scenario where galaxies grow via star formation and quench at the characteristic mass $\log(M^{*}/{\rm M}_{\odot})\sim10.6$. Bulge systems ($B/T>0.6$) dominate the quiescent SMF at ${\rm log}(M_{\star}/{\rm M_{\odot}})>10$ at all redshifts, while disks ($B/T<0.2$) dominate at ${\rm log}(M_{\star}/{\rm M_{\odot}})<9$. However, most bulge-dominated galaxies are star-forming, with their fraction increasing with redshift and decreasing mass, consistent with being progenitors of quiescent bulges. We find evidence for environmental quenching onset at $z\sim3$ from the upturn in the quiescent SMF at ${\rm log}(M_{\star}/{\rm M_{\odot}})<9.5$, contributed by disk-dominated galaxies consistent with satellite quenching that retains disk morphologies. Number densities of ${\rm log}(M_{\star}/{\rm M_{\odot}})>10$ quiescent galaxies are lower than recent literature by $0.1-0.7$ dex, but agree well with simulations at $2<z<3$. At $z>3$, simulations increasingly underpredict observations. Finally, we build an empirical model describing galaxy number density evolution by parametrizing quenching rates, baryon conversion efficiency, and bulge formation. Our model supports a scenario where star-forming galaxies grow central bulges before quenching in massive halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave observations of massive, rapidly spinning binary black holes mergers provide increasing evidence for the dynamical origin of some mergers. Previous studies have interpreted the mergers with primary mass $\gtrsim45\,M_\odot$ as being dominated by hierarchical, second-generation mergers, with rapidly spinning primaries being the products of previous black hole mergers assembled in dense stellar clusters. In this work, we reveal confident evidence of another subpopulation with rapid and isotropic spins at low mass containing the two exceptional events GW241011 and GW241110, consistent with a hierarchical merger hypothesis. Our result suggests the mass distribution of the second-generation black holes is peaked at low primary masses of $\sim16\,M_\odot$ rather than $\gtrsim45\,M_\odot$ in the pair-instability gap. Such low-mass second-generation black holes must be formed from the merger of even lighter first-generation black holes, implying that dense, metal-rich stellar environments contribute to the binary black hole population. By separating the contamination of higher-generation black holes, our result reveals the primary mass distribution of first-generation black holes formed from stellar collapse, which shows a significant dip between $\sim12\,M_\odot$ to $\sim20\,M_\odot$. This may indicate a dearth of black holes due to variation in the core compactness of the progenitor.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter (DM) halos form hierarchically in the Universe through a series of merger events. Cosmological simulations can represent this series of mergers as a graph-like ``tree'' structure. Previous work has shown these merger trees are sensitive to cosmology simulation parameters, but as DM structures, the outstanding question of their sensitivity to DM models remains unanswered. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of deep learning methods trained on merger trees to infer Warm Dark Matter (WDM) particles masses from the DREAMS simulation suite. We organize the merger trees from 1,024 zoom-in simulations into graphs with nodes representing the merger history of galaxies and edges denoting hereditary links. We vary the complexity of the node features included in the graphs ranging from a single node feature up through an array of several galactic properties (e.g., halo mass, star formation rate, etc.). We train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict the WDM mass using the graph representation of the merger tree as input. We find that the GNN can predict the mass of the WDM particle ($R^2$ from 0.07 to 0.95), with success depending on the graph complexity and node features. We extend the same methods to supernovae and active galactic nuclei feedback parameters $A_\text{SN1}$, $A_\text{SN2}$, and $A_\text{AGN}$, successfully inferring the supernovae parameters. The GNN can even infer the WDM mass from merger tree histories without any node features, indicating that the structure of merger trees alone inherits information about the cosmological parameters of the simulations from which they form.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal features provide signatures of recent galaxy mergers, offering insights into the role of mergers in galaxy evolution. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will allow for an unprecedented study of tidal features around millions of galaxies. We use mock images of galaxies at $z\sim0$ ($z\sim0.2$ for \textsc{NewHorizon}) from \textsc{NewHorizon}, \textsc{eagle}, \textsc{IllustrisTNG}, and \textsc{Magneticum Pathfinder} simulations to predict the properties of tidal features in LSST-like images. We find that tidal features are more prevalent around blue galaxies with intrinsic colours $(g-i)\leq0.5$, compared to redder ones, at fixed stellar mass. This trend correlates with elevated specific star formation rates ($\mathrm{sSFR}>10^{-10}\mathrm{\:yr}^{-1}$), suggesting that merger-induced star formation contributes to the bluer colours. Tidal feature hosts in the red sequence appear to exhibit colour profiles offset to bluer colours for galaxies with stellar masses $10^{10}<M_{\star\mathrm{,\:30\:pkpc}}/\mathrm{M}_\odot<10^{11}$, similarly blue cloud tidal feature host galaxies appear to have their colour profiles offset to bluer colours for $10^{9.5}<M_{\star\mathrm{,\:30\:pkpc}}/\mathrm{M}_\odot<10^{10.5}$. However, the differences in colour profiles in either the red sequence or the blue cloud are not statistically robust and larger samples are needed to test if these differences are real. The predictions across the simulations are quantitatively distinct; therefore, LSST observations will allow us to further constrain the differences between different subgrid physics models.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar and planetary magnetic fields play a crucial role in the habitability of a planet and the integrity of its atmosphere. The recently claimed detection of biosignatures, methane, carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulfide/disulfide, in the atmosphere of K2-18 b, a sub-Neptune orbiting an M dwarf star present an intriguing question regarding the stellar magnetic environment and the resistance of the planet's magnetosphere (if it exists) to erosion by magnetic activity from the host. To probe for radio emission from the system, we have conducted observations using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at S, C and X-bands (2-4, 4.5-7.5 and 8-10 GHz respectively) to search for coherent and incoherent radio emission. We detect no radio emission associated with incoherent emission mechanisms. We report $3\sigma$ Stokes I upper limits of $49.8\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at S-band, $17.7\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$at C-band and $18.0\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at X-band and an upper limit of the ratio of the radio to the total bolometric luminosity of $\log L_\text{R}/\log L_\text{bol}<-8.8$. We have also searched for short duration bursts associated with coherent emission mechanisms at C and X-bands . No signals above a $3\sigma$ significance threshold are detected. Although no signals are detected our radio observations offer constraints, albeit limited, on the stellar magnetic environment supporting recent X-ray observations indicating K2-18 is a very faint emitter. Our results also contextualise any planetary transmission spectra by providing constraints on the activity level of the host.

 - **Abstract**
 Several gamma ray bursts have recently been associated with a kilonova emission. We study the mechanisms which could account for this effect, by means of radioactive decay of elements synthesized in accretion disk wind. We model the r-process nucleosynthesis in the accretion disk wind system, asscociated with the prompt GRB phase. We compute the time-dependent GR MHD evolution of a GRB central engine where the newly formed black hole is accreting the mass from post-merger remnant. We explore the wind properties, for a range of the initial parameters of the system, and study representative cases for compact binary merger progenitors. We compute a suite of 2D and 3D time-dependent General Relativistic numerical simulations with a tabulated 3-parameter equation of state that allows for evolution of chemical composition evolution of the accretion flow. The neutrino emission is accounted for by incorporating the leakage scheme, where neutrino optical depth is calculated along the radial rays. We parameterize the optically thick and thin tori with different values of the pressure maximum and entropy in the disk, while the strength of large-scale poloidal magnetic fields is parameterized according to the chosen gas-to-magnetic pressure ratio. To probe the winds, we follow the particle trajectories. Upon this, we derive the nucleosynthetic yields of heavy elements in the outflows, and we map the regions of Lanthanide rich and poor ejecta. We find that the outflow carries high mass of neutron rich material expanding with mildly relativistic velocities. Our accretion disks operating under the SANE mode can power the GRB jets via neutrino annihilation, if the disk to BH mass ratio is larger than about 0.01 and the black hole is spinning. Slowly spinning black holes surrounded by massive post-merger disks can power these jets, and also be the sites of efficient nucleosynthesis of Lanthanides.
