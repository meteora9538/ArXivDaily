 - **Abstract**
 Protoclusters represent the most extreme environments in the very early Universe. They form from large-scale dark matter overdensities, harbouring an overabundance of galaxies fed by large gas reservoirs. Their early and accelerated evolution results in a distinct difference in the properties of galaxies resident in protoclusters versus the field, which is known to be in place by $z\sim 5-6$. We utilise JWST NIRCam observations of the A2744-z7p9OD protocluster at $z=7.88$ to constrain the properties of resident galaxies. We identify seven new protocluster members, bringing the total number to 23 and the total stellar mass of the protocluster to in excess of $10^{10}\ \rm{M_{\odot}}$. These galaxies are remarkably evolved just 650 Myr after the Big Bang, preferentially showing redder UV-slopes and stronger Balmer breaks than is typical of field galaxies. We use the PROSPECTOR spectral energy distribution fitting code to derive key galaxy properties, finding distinct populations in the core versus the outskirts of the protocluster. The core is largely composed of dusty, massive galaxies which can be characterised as undergoing a synchronised (mini)-quenched phase, while galaxies in the protocluster outskirts are undergoing recent bursts of star formation. Finally, a strong suppression of the continuum around the Ly$\alpha$-break evidences extreme neutral hydrogen column densities in many resident galaxies ($N_{\rm HI}\gtrsim10^{23}\ {\rm cm^{-2}}$). The A2744-z7p9OD system is the most extreme, evolved overdensity yet observed at $z>7$, with higher stellar masses, gas densities, and dust attenuation, revealing the intersection of local environment and high-redshift galaxy formation at their extremes.

 - **Abstract**
 In its first two years of operation, the James Webb Space Telescope has enabled the discovery of a surprising number of UV-bright galaxies at $z\sim10-14$. Their number density is still relatively uncertain, due to cosmic variance effects, and the limited survey area with deep imaging. Here, we combine pure parallel imaging from the PANORAMIC survey with data from legacy fields to constrain the bright end (M$_{\rm UV}<-18.5$) of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) over $0.28\,$deg$^2$ of NIRCam imaging in 6 or more filters, and along 35 independent lines of sight. Using conservative color selections, we compile robust dropout samples at $z\sim10$, $z\sim13$, and $z\sim17$, and identify 16 new candidates from PANORAMIC. Our inferred UVLFs at $z\sim10$ are consistent with literature results and we confirm the high abundance of galaxies at the bright end (M$_{\rm UV}\lesssim-21$) with better number statistics. We find somewhat lower number densities at $z\sim13$ compared to previous studies, and no robust candidates at $z\sim17$, indicating a rapid evolution of the galaxy population from $z\sim10-17$. The improved upper limits at $z\sim17$ imply that the cosmic UV luminosity density drops by at least a factor $\sim50$ from $z\sim10$ to $z\sim17$. Comparing our results to models proposed to explain the abundance of UV-bright galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$, we conclude that a modest increase in the star formation efficiency, or in the burstiness of star formation, a more top-heavy initial mass function, a lack of dust attenuation, or a combination of these effects at $z\gtrsim10$, is sufficient to match our observational constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the MOPTOP polarimeter on the 2-meter Liverpool Telescope, we conducted a monitoring campaign targeting three optically-discovered TDEs (AT2024bgz, AT2024pvu, and AT2024wsd) and two Bowen flares in AGN (AT2020afhd and AT2019aalc). The three thermal TDEs showed low intrinsic polarization levels ($\Delta P \approx 0$-$6\%$) with stable polarization angles. The Bowen flares also showed variable polarization degree ($ \Delta P \approx 0$-$8\%$), but significant polarization angle variability: AT2020afhd exhibited a $\Delta \theta = 83 \pm 8 \,^\circ$ shift at 150 days post-optical peak, while the AT2019aalc displayed quasi-periodic swings of $\Delta \theta \approx 40 \, ^\circ$ amplitude starting 190 days after peak brightness. The TDEs of this study are well described by models invoking rapid disk formation and reprocessed emission from optically thick outflows, whereas the Bowen flares reveal more complex reprocessing geometries, potentially consistent with TDEs occurring in AGN gas-rich environments. We find that moderate polarization is observed at later times for TDEs with low-Eddington ratios and highly extended photospheres. This implies that, as the accretion level declines, we expect more asymmetric reprocessing layers along a given viewing angle. Since the outflow density and velocity depend sensitively on the inclination angle, we expect TDEs with low-Eddington ratios and highly extended photospheres to exhibit varying levels of polarization. The polarization of AT2019aalc (Seyfert 1) hints at a clumpy, asymmetric outflow and the presence of a tilted, precessing accretion disk, while the polarization of AT2020afhd (AGN type 2) is consistent with the detection of a scattered light echo.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic field is known to play a crucial role in star formation. Dust polarization is an effective tool for probing the morphology of the field, yet it does not directly trace its strength. Several methods have been developed, combining polarization and spectroscopic data, to estimate the strength of the magnetic field, including the DCF method, which relates these quantities to the magnetic-field strength under the assumption of Alfvénic turbulence. Skalidis & Tassis (2021) (ST), relaxed this assumption to account for the compressible modes, deriving more accurate estimates of the field strength. We evaluate the accuracy of these methods in star-forming regions and propose a systematic approach for calculating the key observational parameters involved: the velocity dispersion (dv), the dispersion of polarization angles (d\theta), and the cloud density (rho). We use a 3D MHD chemodynamical simulation of a turbulent molecular cloud and generate synthetic observations, for seven different inclination angles. We employ various approaches for estimating the parameters dv, d\theta, and rho and find that the approach used to calculate these parameters plays a crucial role in estimating the magnetic field strength. We show that the value probed by both the DCF and ST methods corresponds to the median of the molecular-species-weighted POS component of the magnetic field. The ST outperforms DCF, accurately following the expected cosine trend with respect to the inclination angle, and remains within 1\sigma from the true strength of the field. Based on our analysis, we proposed that, in self-gravitating clouds, the intrinsic parameters (rho, dv, d\theta) should be calculated as follows: rho using radiative transfer analysis, dv using the second moment maps, and d\theta by fitting Gaussians to the polarization angle distributions to remove the contribution of the hourglass morphology.

 - **Abstract**
 Proto-planetary disks display the so-called size-luminosity relation, where their mm-wavelength fluxes scale linearly with their emitting areas. This suggests that these disks are optically thick in mm-band, an interpretation further supported by their near-black-body spectral indexes. Such characteristics are seen not only among disks in very young star-forming regions like Lupus (1-3 Myrs), but, as we demonstrate here, also among disks in the much older Upper Scorpius region (5-11 Myrs). How can disks shine brightly for so long, when grain growth and subsequent radial drift should have quickly depleted their solid reservoir? Here, we suggest that the "bouncing barrier" provides the answer. Even colliding at very low speeds (below 1cm/s), grains already fail to stick to each other but instead bounce off in-elastically. This barrier stalls grain growth at a near-universal size of $\sim 100 \mu m$. These small grains experience much reduced radial drift, and so are able to keep the disks bright for millions of years. They are also tightly coupled to gas, offering poor prospects for processes like streaming instability or pebble accretion. We speculate briefly on how planetesimals can arise in such a bath of 100-micron grains.

 - **Abstract**
 Multimessenger astronomy seeks to uncover the origins of cosmic rays and neutrinos. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory plays a key role in monitoring the sky for revealing high energy neutrinos and neutrino time clusters possibly associated with astrophysical sources, issuing alerts to the astrophysical community for significant excesses. This enables joint observations with other astronomical facilities that could reveal the hidden mechanisms behind the most extreme environments in the Universe. In particular, since 2006 the Gamma-ray Follow-Up (GFU) program shares cluster alerts with partner Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes. The faint cosmic signals, searched against large atmospheric backgrounds, are widely masked by the statistical penalties that arise when scanning the full sky in an unbiased way. Hence, targeted analyses of pre-selected neutrino source candidates have proven to increase our search sensitivity. Our understanding of astrophysical environments has improved in recent years, with evidence of neutrino emission from the blazar TXS 0506+056 and the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. The aim of expanding observational possibilities and engaging the broader scientific community through public cluster alerts has motivated the creation of a new list of target sources to be monitored by IceCube. This contribution presents the systematic compilation of this list, which extends the well-established focus on gamma-ray bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) to include X-ray bright AGN and binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous and Ultra-luminous IR galaxies ((U)LIRGs) are critical for investigating feedback mechanisms due to a combination of intense star formation (SF) episodes and active galactic nuclei (AGN), particularly in the context of complex galaxy interactions. We conduct a detailed analysis of the II ZW 096 merging system using the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), combining high-resolution Narrow Field Mode (NFM) and large-area Wide Field Mode (WFM) observations. We mapped the morphology, kinematics, and ionizing radiation of the system's gas by fitting atomic emission lines and the optical continuum. We identify three or more distinct galaxies within II ZW 096, revealing rotational patterns and complex interactions consistent with a collapsing small galaxy group. The kinematics and ionization structures suggest high star formation rates and shock-driven processes, which align with this proposed scenario. Focusing on the D1 compact region, which contributes 40-70% of the system's IR emission, and combining information from archival multi-wavelength observations, we find strong evidence of a heavily obscured AGN powering it. Our analysis of the internal structure, interactions, and merger state of II ZW 096 offers novel insights into the galaxy evolution processes in this dynamic and highly chaotic system

 - **Abstract**
 The central 5 parsecs of our Galactic Center is rich in various molecular tracers. The region is observed to be hot, highly ionized, and volatile, resulting in complex chemistry and kinematics. Countless molecular observations of the central region orbiting the central super-massive black hole Sgr A* have revealed a stable grouping of clouds with a disk-like structure known as the circumnuclear disk (CND) orbiting Sgr A* between 1.5 and 3 pc. The CND houses the densest population of gas outside the ionized streams in the minispiral falling onto Sgr A*. However, the small-scale kinematics of the clouds and gas are poorly understood in this region. In this paper, we report single dish SiO (1-0) observations of the central 5 pc surrounding Sgr A* taken with the Green Bank Telescope. Most of the SiO (1-0) traces the southern streamer and Sgr A East-neither of which are associated with the CND. However, one region in the CND, known as the NE Arm, shows high-intensity SiO emission unlike in the rest of the CND, indicating the NE Arm as a candidate region of either cloud-cloud collision or early star formation. Further high resolution observations of the region are needed to distinguish between the two scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying galaxy evolution requires knowledge not only of the stellar properties, but also of the interstellar medium (in particular the molecular phase) out of which stars form, using a statistically significant and unbiased sample of galaxies. To this end, we introduce here the integrated Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution (iEDGE), a collection of integrated stellar and nebular emission lines, and molecular gas properties from 643 galaxies in the local Universe. These galaxies are drawn from the CALIFA datasets, and are followed up in CO lines by the APEX, CARMA, and ACA telescopes. As this database is assembled from data coming from a heterogeneous set of telescopes (including IFU optical data and single-dish and interferometric CO data), we adopted a series of techniques (tapering, spatial and spectral smoothing, and aperture correction) to homogenise the data. Due to the application of these techniques, the database contains measurements from the inner regions of the galaxies and for the full galaxy extent. We used the database to study the fundamental star formation relationships between star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass ($M_*$), and molecular gas mass ($M_{\rm mol}$) across galaxies with different morphologies. We observed that the diagrams defined by these quantities are bi-modal, with early-type passive objects well separated from spiral star-forming galaxies. Additionally, while the molecular gas fraction ($f_{\rm mol}=M_{\rm mol}/M_*$) decreases homogeneously across these two types of galaxies, the star formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/$M_{\rm mol}$) in the inner regions of passive galaxies is almost two orders of magnitude lower compared to the global values. This indicates that inside-out quenching requires not only low $f_{\rm mol}$, but also strongly reduced SFE in the galactic centres.
#### The EDGE-CALIFA survey: Star formation relationships for galaxies at different stages of their evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy evolution is largely driven by star formation activity or by the cessation of it, also called star formation quenching. In this paper, we present star formation scaling relations for galaxies at different evolutionary stages. To do so, we used the integrated Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution (iEDGE), which collects CO, optical continuum, and emission line information for 643 galaxies from the CALIFA IFU dataset. By considering the patterns described by star-forming and retired regions, we grouped the galaxies into quenching stages using the emission line classification scheme, QueStNA. We observed that the molecular gas mass ($M_{\rm mol}$) decreases from star-forming to retired systems and so does the molecular-to-stellar mass ratio ($f_{\rm mol}$). In contrast, star formation efficiency (SFE) is constant in the quenching stages dominated by star formation and rapidly declines afterwards. We observed that this rapid decline is more pronounced in the centre of the galaxies compared to the rest of the discs, reflecting the inside-out quenching displayed by nearby galaxies. We noticed that the relations between $M_{\rm mol}$ and the stellar mass ($M_*$) become increasingly shallow with the quenching stages; however, the relations between the star formation rate (SFR) and $M_{\rm mol}$ steepen when going from star-forming to retired systems. We observed that a three-dimensional relation between SFR, $M_*$, and $M_{\rm mol}$ exists for star-forming galaxies, while data points from other quenching groups are scattered across the parameter space. Taken together, these pieces of evidence indicate that the quenching of the galaxies cannot be explained solely by a depletion of the molecular gas and that a significant decrease in the SFE is necessary to retire the centre of the galaxies beyond the star formation green valley.
#### The Distribution of Atomic Hydrogen in the Hosts Galaxies of FRBs

 - **Abstract**
 We probe the atomic hydrogen (HI) emission from the host galaxies of fast radio bursts (FRBs) to investigate the emerging trend of disturbance and asymmetry in the population. Quadrupling the sample size, we detect 13 of 14 new hosts in HI, with the only non-detection arising in a galaxy known to be transitioning towards quiescence. With respect to typical local Universe galaxies, FRB hosts are generally massive in HI ($M_{HI}>10^9 M_\odot$), which aligns with previous studies showing that FRB hosts also tend to have high stellar masses and are star-forming. However, they span a broad range of other HI derived properties. In our independent sample of repeater hosts, we observe a statistically insignificant preference towards lower HI masses compared to non-repeater hosts, similar to the low-significance trend toward lower stellar masses previously reported. Using visual inspection alongside various asymmetry metrics, we identify four unambiguously settled host galaxies, demonstrating for the first time that a disturbed HI morphology is not a universal feature of FRB host galaxies. However, we find another six that show clear signs of disturbance, and three which require deeper, more targeted observations to reach a conclusion; this brings the confirmed ratio of disturbed-to-settled FRB hosts to 11:4. Given that roughly a 1:1 ratio is expected for random background galaxies of similar type, our observed ratio yields a p-value of 0.065. Unlike earlier indications based on smaller samples, this no longer crosses the conventional threshold for statistical significance, though is still near enough to hint at a legitimate excess of disturbance among FRB hosts. Thus, an even larger sample size of FRB hosts observed in HI is required to fully clarify whether the trend is genuine or still a consequence of low-number statistics - a sample that upcoming data releases are well positioned to provide.
#### Long-Lived Isomers of C$_{11}$H$_9^+$: New Experimental Insights from the PIRENEA Setup

 - **Abstract**
 The dehydrogenated cation of methylated benzene is known to exist in two isomeric forms: benzylium and tropylium. Structurally similar forms have been proposed for the -H cations of methylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, but their spectroscopic characterization remains limited, and their photophysical properties are still poorly understood. Previous studies identified 2-naphthylmethylium and benzyltropylium as specific long-lived isomers of the -H fragment of methylnaphthalene cations. Here, we investigate the photodissociation spectroscopy and photoprocessing of gas-phase C$_{11}$H$_9^+$ ions in the visible range. Experiments are conducted using the versatile laboratory astrophysics setup PIRENEA, which enables studies over long timescales ($\sim$1000 s) and allows photoprocessing to be combined with ion-molecule reaction experiments. We confirm the presence of 2-naphthylmethylium and benzyltropylium and additionally identify 1-naphthylmethylium, previously undetected in experiments. Moreover, we present the first complete quantitative analysis of the relative abundances of these isomers and provide clear evidence of interconversion among the three long-lived species. These isomerization processes occur below the dissociation threshold, a finding supported by molecular dynamics simulations. The photophysical properties of C$_{11}$H$_9^+$ isomers -- including isomerization and fluorescence -- make them intriguing candidates for consideration in astrophysical environments exposed to mild UV irradiation (h$\nu$ < 7 eV). Moreover, their detection via rotational spectroscopy in such regions is facilitated by their closed-shell electronic structure.

 We report the detection of a gravitationally lensed galaxy by the nearby spiral galaxy CGCG 012-070 ($z = 0.048$) using Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The lensed galaxy is identified through the flux distributions of emission lines in the rest-frame optical, consistent with a source located at a redshift of $z\sim2.89$. The system is detected in [O III]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, H$\beta$, and H$\alpha$ emission lines, exhibiting line ratios typical of a star-forming galaxy. The emission-line flux distributions reveal three distinct components, which are modeled using an elliptical power-law (EPL) mass profile for the lens galaxy. This model provides a good characterization of the source and reveals a disturbed star-forming morphology consistent with those of galaxies at cosmic noon.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy quenching, the intricate process through which galaxies transition from active star-forming states to retired ones, remains a complex phenomenon that requires further investigation. This study investigates the role of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in regulating star formation by analyzing a sample of 643 nearby galaxies with redshifts between 0.005 and 0.03 from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey. Galaxies were classified according to the Quenching Stages and Nuclear Activity (QueStNA) scheme, which categorizes them based on their quenching stage and the presence of nuclear activity. We further utilized the integrated Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution (iEDGE), which combined homogenized optical integral field unit and CO observations. This allowed us to examine how AGNs influence the molecular gas reservoirs of active galaxies compared to their non-active counterparts at similar evolutionary stages. Our Kolmogorov-Smirnov and chi-squared tests indicate that the star formation property distributions and scaling relations of AGN hosts are largely consistent with those of non-active galaxies. However, AGN hosts exhibit systematically higher molecular gas masses across all quenching stages except for the quiescent nuclear ring stage. We find that AGN hosts follow the expected trends of non-active quenching galaxies, characterized by a lower star formation efficiency and molecular gas fraction compared to star-forming galaxies. Our results suggest that signatures of instantaneous AGN feedback are not prominent in the global molecular gas and star formation properties of galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse the stellar mass-metallicity (M-Z) and stellar mass-star formation rate (M-SFR) relations for star-forming galaxies classified by their environment and compare them with matched control samples of field galaxies. Using data from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and the filament catalogue, which categorises galaxies into filaments, tendrils, and voids, we correct emission lines for dust extinction and select star-forming galaxies based on the BPT diagram. Metallicity and star formation rate are estimated and used to fit the M-Z and M-SFR relations through both Bayesian and least-squares approaches. We find that metallicity increases in denser environments, while star formation rate decreases, with the most notable contrasts seen between filament/tendril galaxies and those in voids. Galaxies in filaments and tendrils that are not group members show little to no deviation from their control samples. Morphological analysis reveals no significant differences. Overall, galaxies in denser environments appear more chemically enriched with lower SFRs, likely due to processed material and reduced cold gas availability, while isolated void galaxies maintain higher SFRs and lower metallicities, possibly due to ongoing cold gas accretion. These results suggest that local environmental conditions, rather than large-scale structure alone, are the main drivers of the observed trends.

We detect the H$\alpha$ line emission in this system, revealing a spatially-resolved structure of the H$\alpha$ emitting gas, which consists of two distinct galaxies, E and W, at a projected distance of 0.4". Galaxy E is very compact in the rest-frame UV, while W galaxy is more extended, showing a clumpy structure reminiscent of a tidal tail. The total H$\alpha$ luminosity implies that the system is forming stars at a Star Formation Rate (SFR) of 76$\pm$8 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and 30$\pm$4 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for E and W, respectively. The ionizing photon production efficiency is within the range measured in galaxies at similar redshifts. The high values derived for the H$\alpha$ equivalent widths (EW) and the distinct locations of the E and W galaxies in the $\log(\zeta_\mathrm{ion}$) $-$ EW (H$\alpha$) plane, indicate that the system is dominated by a young (less than 10 Myr) stellar population. The overall spectral energy distribution suggests that in addition to a young stellar population, the two galaxies may have mature stellar population and very different dust attenuation. The derived SFR and stellar masses identify the two galaxies as going through a starburst phase. The kinematics of the ionized gas traced by the H$\alpha$ line show a velocity difference of 175 $\pm$ 28 km s$^{-1}$ between the two components of B14-65666. The in-depth study of systems like B14-65666 reveal how galaxy mergers in the early Universe drive intense star formation, shape the interstellar medium, and influence the buildup of stellar mass, just 700 $-$ 800 Myr after the Big Bang.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical neutrinos provide crucial insights into their sources and play a key role in multi-messenger astronomy. The neutrino flavor composition at Earth allows us to probe the mechanisms of neutrino production and cosmic ray acceleration, as well as the properties of the environments in which they originate. Understanding the flavor composition also offers a unique opportunity to test new physics in the neutrino sector. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory consists of 1 km$^3$ of ice instrumented with photomultipliers that detect neutrinos through Cherenkov radiation from their interaction products. Different neutrino interactions result in distinct event topologies, such as tracks, cascades, and double cascade events, which allow for the identification of the interacting neutrino type and measurement of the flavor composition of the astrophysical neutrino flux. In this contribution we present the results of the measurement of the flavor ratio of the High-Energy Starting Event Selection based on 12 years of data, a high-purity sample of neutrino interactions that occur inside the detector. In addition, we discuss various methods that could further improve the analysis in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 While cosmic voids are now recognized as a valuable cosmological probe, identifying them in a galaxy catalog is challenging for multiple reasons: observational effects such as holes in the mask or magnitude selection hinder the detection process; galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution; and it is non-trivial to estimate the detection significance and parameter uncertainties for individual voids. Our goal is to extract a catalog of voids from constrained simulations of the large-scale structure that are consistent with the observed galaxy positions, effectively representing statistically independent realizations of the probability distribution of the cosmic web. This allows us to carry out a full Bayesian analysis of the structures emerging in the Universe. We use 50 posterior realizations of the large-scale structure in the Manticore-Local suite, obtained from the 2M++ galaxies. Running the VIDE void finder on each realization, we extract 50 independent void catalogs. We perform a posterior clustering analysis to identify high-significance voids at the 5$\sigma$ level, and we assess the probability distribution of their properties. We produce a catalog of 100 voids with high statistical significance, available at this https URL, including the probability distributions of the centers and radii of the voids. We characterize the morphology of these regions, effectively producing a template for density environments that can be used in astrophysical applications such as galaxy evolution studies. While providing the community with a detailed catalog of voids in the nearby Universe, this work also constitutes an approach to identifying cosmic voids from galaxy surveys that allows us to account rigorously for the observational systematics intrinsic to direct detection, and provide a Bayesian characterization of their properties.
#### Influence of interstellar environment near the solar system on cosmic-ray spectra and dipole anisotropy

 - **Abstract**
 Properties of interstellar environment near the solar system have been probed by missions like IBEX, Voyager over the last two decades. Although it has been well recognized that properties of cosmic rays up to the PeV energy can be affected by the local interstellar environment, detailed modeling has not been done. We show that a three component model for the cosmic ray proton and helium spectra from GV to several PV can naturally explain the energy dependence of the dipole anisotropy of cosmic ray fluxes by considering effects of the local interstellar environment on cosmic ray transport, addressing the so-called cosmic ray anisotropy problem. In particular, it is shown that the dipole amplitude and position angle below $\sim 100$ TeV are very sensitive to the velocity of the heliosphere in the local interstellar cloud and the motion of the local interstellar cloud in the local standard of rest. Better measurement of cosmic ray flux anisotropy by experiments like LHAASO and properties of the local interstellar environment by future missions like IMAP will be able to test this model.
#### Ray-tracing Fast Radio Bursts Through IllustrisTNG: Cosmological Dispersion Measures from Redshift 0 to 5.5

 - **Abstract**
 The dispersion measures (DMs) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) arise predominantly from free electrons in the large-scale structure of the Universe. The increasing number of FRB observations have started to empirically constrain the distribution of cosmic baryons, making it crucial to accurately forward model their propagation within cosmological simulations. In this work, we present a method for measuring FRB DMs in IllustrisTNG that continuously traces rays through the simulation while reconstructing all traversed line segments within the underlying Voronoi mesh. Leveraging this technique, we create over $20$ publicly available DM catalogs, including a full-sky DM map observed from a Milky Way-like environment. Our method addresses a problem in previous TNG-based studies, in which a sparse snapshot sampling in the path integral leads to a misestimation of the standard deviation and higher moments of the DM distribution $p(\rm{DM}|z)$ by over $50\%$. We show that our results are consistent with the most recent observational data from the DSA-110, ASKAP, and CHIME. We offer a functional form for $p(\rm{DM}| z)$ that provides very good fits across all redshifts from $0$ to $5.5$, showing that the previously proposed log-normal distribution is not well matched to the data. We find that using simulation box sizes smaller than $35\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc or resolutions with baryonic masses of less than $5\times10^{8}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ can distort the derived DM signal by more than $8\%$. Our findings provide new insights into how the cosmic web shapes FRB signals, and highlight the importance of accurate methodology when comparing cosmological simulations against observations.
