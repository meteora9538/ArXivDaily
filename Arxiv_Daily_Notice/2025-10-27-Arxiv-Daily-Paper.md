 - **Abstract**
 The role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in dwarf galaxies remains poorly understood, with conventional wisdom suggesting it primarily suppresses star formation. Using high-resolution MACER3D simulations that directly resolve the Bondi radius, we demonstrate that AGN feedback can significantly enhance rather than suppress star formation in starburst dwarf galaxies. Our simulations reveal that AGN feedback increases global star formation rates by approximately 25% when comparing our models with both AGN and supernova feedback to those with only supernova feedback. This enhancement occurs through AGN-driven outflows creating compressed gas regions where efficient cooling preserves the high density while quickly radiating away thermal energy, creating ideal conditions for star formation. This positive feedback mechanism operates in gas-rich starburst environments with efficient cooling and moderate AGN energy input that compresses gas without expelling it from the galaxy. Critically, it requires both AGN and supernova feedback working in concert: without SN feedback to regulate black hole activity, AGN outflows become too powerful and expel gas rather than compress it. Our results closely match observations of the starburst dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10, where similar shock-compressed regions of enhanced star formation have been observed. These findings challenge conventional understanding of AGN feedback and suggest that AGN may play a previously unrecognized role in accelerating star formation during active phases of dwarf galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Dust grains undergo significant growth in star-forming environments, especially in dense regions prone to gravitational collapse. Although dust is generally assumed to represent $1 \%$ of the gas mass, dust density variations are expected on small scales due to differential dynamics with the gas, leading to enhanced coagulation rates in regions of dust enrichment. Aims: We aim to investigate the clumping of charged dust in the turbulent magnetized dense regions of the interstellar medium. Methods: We develop a dusty model that goes beyond the standard non-ideal MHD and use the code {\ttfamily shark} to perform multifluid 1D simulations of a single size charged dust species and neutral gas with large scale driven turbulence and including ion-neutral friction. Results: We identify a mechanism similar to the parametric instability that efficiently forms dust clumps even in presence of dissipative processes. Such strong clumping survives and is sustained when driving turbulence, and thus high levels of dust concentration are produced due to compressive magnetic effects in regions of shocks. Dust density enhancements are favored by a high transverse-to-longitudinal magnetic ratio which is controlled by: transverse Mach number and plasma parameter. We find that a substantial fraction of dust experiences a density increase of more than a factor of 10 under reasonable conditions, thus promoting dust growth. Conclusion: Our novel dusty non-ideal MHD model shows that dust grains (main charge carriers) are subject to small-scale compressive magnetic effects driven by a parametric instability - like mechanism in regions of shocks, and consequently experience high density enhancements in turbulent environments that go beyond those permitted by pure hydrodynamical processes, making in-situ formation of large grains (sub-mm) in protostellar envelopes a plausible scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of morphologies, based on deep $u^{*}g^{\prime}i^{\prime}z^{\prime}$ imaging of the Virgo Cluster from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS), for 3689 Virgo cluster members spanning a mass range of $\sim$$10^{11}M_{\odot}$ to $\sim$$10^5~M_{\odot}$. Our analysis introduces a new, two-component visual classification scheme developed to capture the morphological diversity of galaxies over more than six orders of magnitude in stellar mass. Our morphological classifications use two parameters to describe the global structure and star formation activity of each galaxy. Structural sub-codes denote features such as spiral arms, bars, disks, shells, streams, while star formation sub-codes indicate the form and location of the current star formation activity (e.g., in cores, clumps, filaments, etc). These visual classifications rely on deep $g^\prime$-band images, supplemented by $u^{*}g^{\prime}i^{\prime}$ color images, as well as unsharp-masked images for a subset of objects. We compare our classifications to previous results for bright member galaxies that used more established schemes, finding good agreement. We also measure quantitative classification statistics (e.g., CASGM$_{20}$) for a subset of the brighter galaxies, and present catalogs for some galaxy types of special interest, including structurally compact galaxies, ultra-diffuse galaxies, candidate ultra-compact dwarf transition objects, as well as candidate post-merger systems. These morphological classifications may be useful as a training set in the application of machine learning tools to the next generation of wide-field imaging surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) carried out a public survey for optical transients between 2007 and 2019, discovering more than 16,000 transient candidates. Here we present the spectra and highlight the results of the spectroscopic follow-up of CRTS extragalactic transients. As expected, we find that the bulk of these transients are normal supernovae. However, as we prioritised transients exhibiting unusual features or environments during our spectroscopic follow-up, we focus on the rarer types of transients. These objects include more than a dozen type-I superluminous supernovae and dozens of type-I and II supernovae that underwent circumstellar medium interactions. We highlight several specific supernovae, including a new analysis of SN 2008iy, a type-IIn which exhibited a bright pre-supernova outburst event similar to SN 2009ip and lasted more than 1800 days; CSS111225:140122+161705, a type-I supernova that showed an extreme 2.5 magnitude rebrightening event more than 200 days after its initial outburst; and SN 2009ny, a type-Ibn supernova that exhibited strong helium emission lines similar to SN 2002ao. We confirm our previous finding that numerous CRTS transients are associated with galaxies of extremely low luminosity. We discuss the difficulty in determining the origin of transients associated with outbursts in active galactic nuclei (AGN), tidal disruption events, and type-IIn supernovae. As an example, we present CSS150120:110008+385352, a CRTS transient similar to CSS100217:102913+404220 that occurred within a quiescent AGN and peaked at Mv = -23.6.

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), putative counterparts of massive, low-metallicity Population III (Pop III) stars, are a promising probe of the first stars. We assess the detectability of these Pop III GRBs using a metallicity-based progenitor criterion and cosmological $N$-body/hydrodynamical simulations with three distinct Pop III initial mass functions (IMFs), focusing on the capabilities of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) aboard the Einstein Probe (\emph{EP}) and the coded-mask gamma-ray imager (ECLAIRs) aboard the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}). Our population synthesis model, calibrated to \emph{Swift} data, predicts the following Population II/I (Pop II/I) GRB detection rates at $z>6$: $\sim2.4\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ for \emph{EP}/WXT and $\sim0.9\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ for \emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs. For the IMF with very massive first stars ($\mathrm{100\textrm{--}500\,M_\odot}$), we derive upper limits on the Pop III GRB rate at $z>6$ of $<0.06\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ (\emph{EP}/WXT) and $<0.13\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ (\emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs), based on the absence of confirmed Pop III progenitors in \emph{Swift} bursts at $z>5.5$. Our results indicate that while Pop III GRBs are subdominant to Pop II/I GRBs at $z<10$, their fractional contribution rises significantly with redshift, reaching $\sim8\%$ ($\sim34\%$) at $z>10$ and $\sim28\%$ ($\sim68\%$) at $z>16$ for \emph{EP}/WXT (\emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs). This trend is systematically enhanced in the other two IMF models, which adopt a lower stellar mass range of $\mathrm{[0.1,\,100]\,M_\odot}$. We conclude that detecting Pop III GRBs at high redshifts is a realistic prospect, and any GRB detected at $z>16$ is most likely of Pop III origin.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations suggest that UV-bright, compact star-forming galaxies produce enough ionizing (Lyman continuum; LyC) photons to reionize the Universe. Yet, the efficiency of LyC escape and the roles of radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae remain uncertain. Using medium-resolution spectra of six nearly identical local star-forming galaxies, we directly trace, for the first time, the evolution of a multiphase wind through individual spectral lines alongside measurements of the LyC escape fraction. We find that LyC escape peaks early, during a period dominated by intense radiation and stellar winds but lacking a fast galactic wind. As the starbursts age, supernovae drive and accelerate the wind, progressively suppressing LyC escape. These results highlight the need for cosmological simulations to incorporate early feedback as a key driver of reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the relationship among the jet magnetic field, black hole spin, black hole mass, Eddington ratio, and optical variability timescales in jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs). By fitting a damped random walk (DRW) model to the g-band light curves, we obtain the characteristic variability timescale ($\tau_{\rm DRW}$) for 41 jetted AGNs with precise supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass measurements. Our main results are as follows: (i) Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between the jet magnetic field ($B_{\rm 1pc}$), black hole spin ($j$) and the characteristic variability timescale within our sample. These findings suggest that the optical variability of jetted AGNs is influenced by the jet magnetic field and black hole spin. Furthermore, the characteristic variability timescale aligns with the electron escape timescale, as evidenced by the relationship between the characteristic variability timescale and jet magnetic field ($\tau_{\rm DRW}\propto B_{\rm 1pc}^{0.76\pm0.22}$). (ii) We confirm a significant correlation between the characteristic variability timescale and SMBH mass, expressed as: $\log \rm \tau_{\rm DRW} = 0.52(\pm0.21)\log M _{\rm BH}/M_{\rm \odot}-3.12(\pm1.90)$, with an intrinsic scatter of 0.08 dex. The slope of this relationship is consistent with that between the thermal timescale and black hole mass. Our results support the hypothesis that magnetorotational instability (MRI) fluctuations drive the intrinsic variability observed in the light curves emitted by the AGNs accretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Assembly bias, which is the variation in halo clustering at fixed mass driven by formation history, has long been predicted by numerical simulations but remains difficult to confirm observationally. In this work, we present one of the first direct observational tests of luminosity-dependent assembly bias using a large sample of galaxy clusters with spectroscopically confirmed brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Combining galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering measurements, we find evidence for assembly bias: brighter BCGs reside in more concentrated halos yet are less strongly clustered on large scales, yielding a relative bias ratio deviating from the unity at about the $3\sigma$ level. Our findings are further supported by the FLAMINGO and MillenniumTNG hydrodynamical simulations, in which we directly detect assembly bias signals consistent with the observations, thereby confirming the connection between galaxy luminosity and halo formation history.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia DR3 data have revealed new massive runaway stars, while spectroscopic surveys enable detailed characterization. The relative contributions of binary supernova (BSS) and dynamical ejection (DES) scenarios to explain their runaway origin remain poorly constrained, particularly in the Milky Way. We aim to characterize the largest sample of Galactic O-type runaway stars ever investigated through their kinematics, rotation, and binarity to shed light into their origins. We use the GOSC-Gaia DR3 catalog, and IACOB spectroscopic information to build a sample with 214 O-type stars with projected rotational velocities ($v \sin{i}$), and a subsample of 168 O-type stars with additional information about their likely single (LS) or single-lined (SB1) spectroscopic binary nature. We also consider an additional sample of 65 double-lined (SB2) spectroscopic binaries. We find that among our sample of Galactic O-type runaways, most (74%) have $v \sin{i}<200$ km/s, whereas for normal stars this fraction is slightly higher (82%). There are no fast-moving runaways being fast rotators, except for HD 124 979. Runaways show lower SB1 fractions than normal stars, with no runaway SB1 fast-rotating systems; on average, runaways rotate faster than normal stars; and their runaway fraction is higher among fast rotators (44%) vs. the slow rotators (34%). This is consistent with BSS dominance for fast rotators. We also found that SB2 systems hardly reach runaway velocities with a low runaway fraction (10%). Runaways with 2D velocities > 60 km/s are mostly single and interpreted as DES products, while runaways with 2D velocities > 85 km/s are also interpreted as two-step products. Three of 12 runaway SB1 systems are HMXBs. Our study reveals that most Galactic O-type runaways are slow rotators, suggests a dominance of BSS among fast-rotating runaways, and of DES and two-step among the high-velocity ones. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are among the most energetic and complex astrophysical phenomena, requiring threedimensional (3D) simulations to capture their intricate explosion mechanisms. One of the key ingredients for such simulations is the 3D pre-collapse structure, which can impact the development and geometry of the subsequent explosion. While stellar convection simulations can provide such 3D initial conditions, these remain too expensive and demanding for widespread use. In this work, we present a method to generate synthetic 3D velocity fields for convective zones from 1D initial conditions, creating initial conditions for CCSN simulations using a vector spherical harmonics expansion without the need for expensive hydrodynamic progenitor simulations. The synthetic velocity field is designed to capture the typical scales and velocities of the convective flow as the most relevant parameters for the subsequent explosions. In addition, it respects relevant physical constraints such as the near-anelasticity of flow, vanishing radial vorticity, and zero net angular momentum in the convective zones. A Python implementation of this method is publicly available, offering the CCSN community a practical tool for generating synthetic velocity fields for multi-dimensional simulations to study the impact of 3D progenitor asymmetries on the CCSN mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 Superrotation is a common feature of quickly rotating gas giants, slowly rotating planetary bodies, and tidally-locked planets. In this paper we compare and contrast the mechanisms of superrotation in slow rotators and tidally-locked planets. We cover a wide range of planetary properties, varying in particular the thermal Rossby number Ro_T (controlled by planetary size, rotation rate, and instellation) and a radiative relaxation timescale T_rad (which parameterizes atmospheric optical thickness). We use a two-level model that contains the principal mechanisms for superrotation in both regimes yet remains analytically tractable. Linearizations of the model elucidate the behavior of superrotation-inducing eddies. In tidally-locked planets a Matsuno-Gill-like structure organizes the eddy effects but of itself is insufficient to produce superrotation; baroclinicity and low-level drag are additional essential ingredients. Nonlinear integrations further explore the superrotating regimes and exhibit significant time variability even in statistical equilibrium. Not all tidally-locked regimes superrotate: subrotation arises at high T_rad (optically thick atmospheres) and weak low-level drag. On axisymmetrically-forced slow rotators, superrotation is always linked to a previously identified Rossby-Kelvin instability. Perhaps surprisingly, the instability itself is also linked to the spinup of superrotation in some tidally-locked regimes. Finally, we explore the continuous transition in the mechanisms of superrotation from axisymmetrically-forced to tidally-locked planets by applying a progressively stronger asymmetric equatorial forcing. The Matsuno-Gill pattern quickly dominates over traveling planetary Rossby-Kelvin waves in forcing superrotation, although both mechanisms can coexist. These results provide a unified view of superrotation mechanisms across a wide range of planetary bodies.

 - **Abstract**
 Does cosmic ray (CR) pressure matter for the circumgalactic medium (CGM)? Despite growing interest, this remains a debated question, complicated by limited observational constraints and differing implementations of CR physics in simulations. While prior studies suggest that CRs influence the thermal and dynamical state of the CGM, their role in shaping cold gas structures remains underexplored. This paper investigates how CRs affect ram-pressure stripped cold gas clouds originating from satellite galaxies in a Milky Way-like halo. Using high-resolution simulations with varying CR energy densities, we find that CRs can significantly modify the size and survival of stripped clouds. Specifically, CR pressure puffs up the cold clouds, increasing their surface area and enabling more efficient mixing-layer cooling, allowing them to grow in mass. This enhanced growth results in higher cold gas inflow rates into the central galaxy, leading to an increase in the star formation rate compared to the no-CR case at a later time. Moreover, CRs can boost the total cold gas mass in the CGM by up to a factor of four. These effects are most pronounced in simulations where the CR energy density is in equipartition with the thermal gas. Our results demonstrate that CRs can play a critical role in regulating the cold phase of the CGM contributed by satellites and therefore their ability to feed galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new framework for modeling the chemical enrichment histories of galaxies by integrating the chemical evolution with resolved star formation histories (SFHs) derived from color-magnitude diagrams. This novel approach links the time evolution of the metallicity of the star-forming ISM to the cumulative stellar mass formed in the galaxy, enabling a physically motivated, self-consistent description of chemical evolution. We apply this methodology to four isolated, gas-rich Local Group dwarf galaxies -- WLM, Aquarius, Leo A, and Leo P -- using deep HST and JWST imaging. For WLM, Aquarius, and Leo A, we independently validate our metallicity evolution results using ages and metallicities of individual red giant stars with spectroscopic measurements, finding good agreement. We quantify systematic uncertainties by repeating our analysis with multiple stellar evolution and bolometric correction libraries. We then compare the observed chemical enrichment histories to predictions from the TNG50 and FIREbox cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and the Galacticus semi-analytic model. We find that the enrichment history of WLM is best reproduced by the FIREbox simulation, while TNG50 and Galacticus predict higher metallicities at early times. Our results suggest that differences in stellar feedback and metal recycling prescriptions drive significant variation in the predicted chemical enrichment of dwarf galaxies, particularly at early times. This work demonstrates the power of combining resolved SFHs with physically motivated chemical evolution models to constrain galaxy formation physics and highlights the need for further observational and theoretical studies of metal retention and recycling in low-mass dwarf galaxies.
