 - **Abstract**
 To support the selection of large optical/infrared telescope sites in western China, long-term monitoring of atmospheric conditions and astronomical seeing has been conducted at the Muztagh-Ata site on the Pamir Plateau since 2017. With the monitoring focus gradually shifting northward, three stations were established: the South Point, North-1 point, and North-2 point. The North-1 point,selected as the site for the 1.93m Muztagh Optical Survey Telescope (MOST), has recorded seeing and meteorological parameters since late 2018. In 2023,the North-2 point was established approximately 1.5 km northeast of North-1 point as a candidate location for a future large-aperture telescope. A 10m DIMM tower and a PC-4A environmental monitoring system were installed to evaluate site quality. This study presents a comparative analysis of data from the North-1 and North-2 points during this http URL median seeing is 0.89 arcsecs at North-1 and 0.78 arcsecs at North-2. Both points show clear seasonal and diurnal variations,with winter nights offering optimal observing this http URL average, about 64% of the nighttime duration per year is suitable for astronomical observations. Nighttime temperature variation is low :2.03 at North-1 and 2.10 at North-2 .Median wind speeds are 5-6 m/s, with dominant directions between 210 and 300, contributing to stable airflow. Moderate wind suppresses turbulence, while strong shear and rapid fluctuations degrade image quality. These findings confirm that both the North-1 and North-2 points offer high-quality atmospheric conditions and serve as promising sites for future ground-based optical/infrared telescopes in western China.

 - **Abstract**
 The orbits of stars around Sgr A*, the Milky Way's supermassive black hole, provide a unique laboratory for testing its environment with unprecedented precision. In this work, we compute the apsidal precession induced by extended matter distributions through Lagrange's equations and compare it with the measured precession of S2, reproducing and extending GRAVITY's constraints. In particular, we push bounds on boson clouds to larger gravitational couplings $\alpha$ and to the second-fastest superradiant mode. We also show that environments with mass of order $1\%$ of Sgr A* drive stellar orbits to decay by dynamical friction within a few Myr. The inner star cluster is however efficiently replenished, masking this effect observationally. We also show that orbital resonances from boson clouds have no impact on relevant timescales. While S2 currently provides the cleanest dataset, our framework is readily applicable to other stars that we identify as particularly promising, whose orbits will be measured with increasing accuracy, opening up new opportunities to probe the environment of Sgr A*.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent observations of highly accreting supermassive black holes (SMBH) at very high redshift ($>$4) with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allowed us to shed light for the very first time on the early evolutionary phases of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps unsurprisingly, several of the physical properties observed in these new objects, including those known as little red dots (LRDs), are closely reminiscent of the low-mass and high-Eddington AGN in the local Universe, and in particular of the class of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies. However, some differences also emerged, likely due to the radically different evolutionary path and the environment where LRDs and NLS1s live. In this work, we review the multiwavelength properties of local NLS1s and compare them with type 1 AGN found at high-$z$, showing that despite some differences, the study of NLS1s can be extremely useful to better understand the extreme accretion physics of high-$z$ quasars and the early stages of AGN evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the star formation activity and black hole scaling relations in a sample of 1451 AGN hosted by dwarf galaxies at redshift 0.5 to 0.9, drawn from the VIPERS survey. The sample comprises Seyferts and LINERs identified through emission-line diagnostics, as well as IR-selected AGN based on WISE colors. Using the parameter SFRnorm, defined as the ratio of the SFR of a galaxy hosting an AGN to the median SFR of star-forming galaxies of similar stellar mass and redshift, we compare AGN hosts to a control sample of non-AGN star-forming galaxies. We examine how SFRnorm varies with AGN power ([O III] luminosity), black hole mass, local environment, and stellar population age. We also analyze the MBH-Mstar relation and the evolution of the MBH/Mstar ratio, incorporating comparisons to X-ray AGN and high-redshift quasars (z > 4). Our key findings are: (i) all AGN populations show suppressed star formation at low AGN luminosities, with SFRnorm rising above unity at different luminosity thresholds depending on AGN type; (ii) LINERs show flat SFRnorm trends with MBH, remaining broadly consistent with unity; Seyferts display a mild increase with MBH, while IR AGN show a more pronounced positive trend; (iii) LINERs exhibit older stellar populations than Seyferts; (iv) at fixed stellar mass, Seyferts host more massive black holes than LINERs, with IR AGN falling in between; (v) the MBH/Mstar ratio is elevated relative to local scaling relations and remains approximately constant with redshift, in agreement with high-z AGN; (vi) the ratio decreases with stellar mass up to log(Mstar/Msun) approximately 11, beyond which it flattens toward values consistent with those of local, inactive galaxies, with this trend clearest for Seyferts and IR AGN. These results suggest that AGN in dwarf galaxies follow diverse evolutionary pathways shaped by gas availability, feedback, and selection effects.
#### Unraveling the Nature of the Nuclear Transient AT2020adpi

 - **Abstract**
 Transient events associated with supermassive black holes provide rare opportunities to study accretion and the environments of supermassive black holes. We present a multiwavelength study of AT2020adpi (ZTF20acvfraq), a luminous optical/UV transient in the nucleus of the galaxy WISEA J231853.77$-$103505.6 ($z=0.26$) that exhibits the properties of an ambiguous nuclear transient. Near peak, its spectral energy distribution is well described by a power law ($\lambda L_\lambda \propto \lambda^{-\alpha}$, $\alpha = 0.44 \pm 0.04$), with a maximum $g$-band luminosity of $(3.6 \pm 0.6)\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is consistent with luminous AGN flares. We detect a strong mid-infrared flare ($L_\mathrm{peak}^{\mathrm{MIR}} = (2.3 \pm 0.05)\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) delayed by $\sim$240 rest-frame days, indicating a hot dust echo from material at $\sim$0.2 pc. The optical and near-infrared spectra show broad H, He I, [OIII] lines, as well as narrow Fe II, and prominent Mg II, which is a combination not typical of TDEs. Taken together, these features suggest AT2020adpi is an ambiguous nuclear transient, where an accretion episode was triggered by stellar disruption of an accretion disk or instabilities within an active nucleus. This source demonstrates the need for careful multiwavelength analysis to distinguish between extreme AGN variability and TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation surveys are expected to uncover thousands of globular cluster (GC) stellar streams, motivating the need for a theoretical framework that produces realistic GC streams in a fully cosmological, Milky Way-like environment. We present $\textsf{CosmoGEMS}$, a star-by-star cosmological GC stream framework that self-consistently links small-scale cluster physics with large-scale Galactic dynamics. The initial phase-space positions of stream stars are informed by post-processed GC populations within the FIRE cosmological simulation. Escaped stars are orbit-integrated from their time of escape to the present day in a time-evolving Galactic potential extracted from the same simulation using a basis function expansion. We explore two example streams on different orbits. One forms a long, thin stream with a velocity dispersion consistent with Milky Way GC streams. However, it exhibits a clump and orbital-phase-dependent misalignments due to the evolving potential. The other stream develops both a thin component and a diffuse, shell-like structure, similar to features observed in streams like Jhelum. These results highlight the power of fully cosmological models in producing realistic stream morphologies and kinematics. Unlike idealized simulations, our models naturally incorporate time-dependent changes in the progenitor's orbit, including orbital plane evolution, which significantly affects stream structure. This challenges common assumptions in stream-finding algorithms and interpretation. $\textsf{CosmoGEMS}$ provides a key step toward connecting future stellar stream observations with the physics of globular cluster evolution and hierarchical galaxy formation in a cosmological context.
#### Weakened Magnetic Braking Signals the Collapse of the Global Stellar Dynamo

 - **Abstract**
 Weakened magnetic braking (WMB) was originally proposed in 2016 to explain anomalously rapid rotation in old field stars observed by the Kepler mission. The proximate cause was suggested to be a transition in magnetic morphology from larger to smaller spatial scales. In a series of papers over the past five years, we have collected spectropolarimetric measurements to constrain the large-scale magnetic fields for a sample of stars spanning this transition, including a range of spectral types from late F to early K. During this time, we gradually improved our methods for estimating the wind braking torque in each of our targets, and for evaluating the associated uncertainties. Here, we reanalyze the entire sample with a focus on uniformity for the relevant observational inputs. We supplement the sample with two additional active stars to provide more context for the evolution of wind braking torque with stellar Rossby number (Ro). The results demonstrate unambiguously that standard spin-down models can reproduce the evolution of wind braking torque for active stars, but WMB is required to explain the subsequent abrupt decrease in torque as Ro approaches a critical value for dynamo excitation. This transition is seen in both the large-scale magnetic field and the X-ray luminosity, indicating weakened coronal heating. We interpret these transitions as evidence of a rotational threshold for the influence of Coriolis forces on global convective patterns and the resulting inefficiency of the global stellar dynamo.

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2019hnl. Discovered within ~26 hr of explosion by the ATLAS survey, SN 2019hnl is a typical Type IIP supernova with a peak absolute V band magnitude of -16.7+-0.1 mag, a plateau length of ~107 days, and an early decline rate of 0.0086+-0.0006 mag (50 days)^-1. We use nebular spectroscopy and hydrodynamic modeling with the SNEC, MESA, and STELLA codes to infer that the progenitor of SN 2019hnl was a M_ZAMS ~ 11M_solar red supergiant which produced 0.047+-0.007M_solar of 56Ni in the explosion. As a part of our hydrodynamic modeling, we reduced hydrogen envelope mass by scaling the mass loss within the "Dutch" wind scheme to fit our light curve, showing that the progenitor of a relatively typical Type IIP SN may experience partial stripping during their evolution and establish massive (~0.2M_solar) CSM environments prior to core collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 Some black holes in X-ray binaries accrete at rates far above the Eddington limit. In this supercritical regime, photons are trapped in a radiation-dominated, geometrically thick disk. The innermost regions form a complex environment of intense radiation, strong magnetic fields, and powerful outflows, where radiation-driven winds expel large amounts of mass. These conditions suppress primary relativistic electrons within the transparent funnel along the black hole's spin axis. We show that high-energy electrons can instead arise as secondary pairs from Bethe-Heitler interactions between relativistic protons and ambient photons. Using self-similar models of accretion disks with strong winds of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), we compute particle acceleration via magnetic reconnection and diffusive shocks, evaluate energy losses, and assess the efficiency and spectral imprint of Bethe-Heitler pair production. Our results suggest that secondary pairs can yield nonthermal radiation in the 0.1-100 MeV range with luminosities from $10^{34}$ up to $10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This emission could be detectable by future MeV instruments from Galactic ULXs, offering evidence of relativistic protons in their inner funnels and revealing misaligned, otherwise hidden, super-Eddington sources in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) exhibit strong variability over timescales of minutes to decades. However, much theoretical work assumes that CTTS are in stable spin states. Here, we test expectations for CTTS angular momentum regulation by comparing star and disk rotation. We measure stellar rotation periods and disk corotation radii ($R_{\rm co}$) for 47 CTTS from the HST ULLYSES sample. We compare $R_{\rm co}$ to the magnetospheric truncation radii ($R_{\rm i}$) and show that most CTTS are in the spin-up regime based on model predictions, which may indicate efficient angular momentum loss processes. We find evidence of magnetospheric outflows and episodic accretion, and our observations are consistent with the presence of accretion-powered stellar winds. We confirm predictions that $R_{\rm i}$ is variable over timescales of days, causing some CTTS to cross accretion stability regime boundaries. We characterize light curve morphologies and confirm that our inclined CTTS with $R_{\rm i}\sim R_{\rm co}$ show dipper light curves, consistent with expectations from disk warp models. However, dippers occur at all values of $R_{\rm i}/R_{\rm co}$, suggesting that they do not need to be near the propeller regime. Finally, we show that our measured $R_{\rm i}$ locations are consistent with observed ultra-short-period planet (USP) semi-major axes. If USPs are stable against tidal dissipation, as has been suggested in the literature, then our work provides a plausible USP formation channel. These results show that the star-disk connection produces a large variety of accretion and stellar spin configurations, most of which are likely not in equilibrium.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a joint analysis of TESS photometry and radial velocity measurements obtained from the Minerva-Australis facility for two short-period eclipsing binaries, TIC 48227288 and TIC 339607421. TIC 339607421 hosts an M-dwarf companion ($M_B = 0.294 \pm 0.013 \: M_{\odot}$, $R_B = 0.291 \pm 0.006 \: R_{\odot}$) orbiting an F6V star ($M_A=1.09 \pm 0.04 \: M_{\odot}$, $R_A=1.21^{+0.03}_{-0.02} \: R_{\odot}$). While TIC 48227288 contains a late K class companion ($M_B=0.635 \pm 0.037 \: M_{\odot}$, $R_B = 0.605 \pm 0.011 \: R_{\odot}$) orbiting an F3V star ($M_A = 1.36^{+0.06}_{-0.08} \: M_{\odot}$, $R_A = 1.61 \pm 0.03 \: R_{\odot}$). Both companions follow short period, near-circular orbits ($P_B = 2.4-3.0$ d, $e \approx 0.001$). Sky-projected obliquities for each system were derived using a classical analysis of the RV perturbation and the Reloaded Rossiter-McLaughlin (RRM) technique. The classical method indicates minor spin-orbit misalignment for both systems ($\lambda_A = -14.7^{+5.4}_{-5.9}$ deg and $-17.8^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$ deg for TIC 339607421 and TIC 48227288, respectively). The RRM analysis yields smaller obliquities ($\lambda_A = -8.2 \pm 0.2$ deg and $-9.5 \pm 0.2$ deg respectively), but confirms the minor misalignment inferred from the classical analysis. The findings of misaligned, circular orbits are notable even though the misalignments are not large, and suggest potential gaps in current models of binary formation and orbital evolution. As such, further investigation of these and similar systems appears warranted.

 - **Abstract**
 Most baryons in present-day galaxy clusters exist as hot gas ($\boldsymbol{\gtrsim10^7\,\rm}\mathrm{K}$), forming the intracluster medium (ICM). Cosmological simulations predict that the mass and temperature of the ICM rapidly decrease with increasing cosmological redshift, as intracluster gas in younger clusters is still accumulating and being heated. The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect arises when cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons are scattered to higher energies through interactions with energetic electrons in hot ICM, leaving a localized decrement in the CMB at a long wavelength. The depth of this decrement is a measure of the thermal energy and pressure of the gas. To date, the effect has been detected in only three systems at or above $z\sim2$, when the Universe was 4 billion years old, making the time and mechanism of ICM assembly uncertain. Here, we report observations of this effect in the protocluster SPT2349$-$56 with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). SPT2349$-$56 contains a large molecular gas reservoir, with at least 30 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) and three radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a 100-kpc region at $z=4.3$, corresponding to 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang. The observed tSZ signal implies a thermal energy of $\mathbf{\sim 10^{61}\,\mathrm{erg}}$, exceeding the possible energy of a virialized ICM by an order of magnitude. Contrary to current theoretical expectations, the strong tSZ decrement in SPT2349$-$56 demonstrates that substantial heating can occur and deposit a large amount of thermal energy within growing galaxy clusters, overheating the nascent ICM in unrelaxed structures, two billion years before the first mature clusters emerged at $\mathbf{z \sim 2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 This work investigates the use of stellar occultation measurements to enhance the orbit determination performance of the Lunar Meteoroid Impact Observer (LUMIO) mission, operating from a quasi-Halo orbit around the Earth-Moon L2 point. During science phases, when radiometric tracking is sparse and low illumination limits conventional optical navigation methods, occultation events, defined as precise timings of stellar appearances/disappearances behind the Moon's limb, offer a suitable alternative. A simulation tool based on JPL's MONTE library was developed to identify valid occultation events, applying geometric and illumination constraints to exclude non-observable cases. These events were integrated into a batch least-squares orbit determination filter alongside conventional radiometric data. The covariance analysis shows that occultation observables reduce the transverse and normal position uncertainties of LUMIO by up to a factor of two, especially during tracking gaps or occultation-rich arcs. This uncertainty reduction is expected to facilitate station-keeping operations and constrain the surface localization of Lunar Impact Flashes (LIFs), enhancing the mission's scientific return. Sensitivity analyses confirm that the orbit determination performance is primarily driven by the timing accuracy of occultation events, with limited dependence on lunar shape uncertainty below 100 m. These findings confirm the potential of occultation-based navigation to enhance spacecraft autonomy and robustness in low-visibility environments, making it a valuable complement to radiometric techniques for future lunar and deep-space missions.
#### SISSI: Supernovae in a stratified, shearing interstellar medium. II. Star formation near the Sun is quenched by expansion of the Local Bubble

 - **Abstract**
 The age of the Local Bubble (LB) can be used to constrain the timescales, on which the interstellar medium in the solar neighborhood is evolving. Previous estimates have put the age of the LB at $\gtrsim 14\,\text{Myr}$, and suggested that its expansion was powered by $\sim 15-20$ SNe, yet in a companion paper we have seen hints that this age might be too high. Following up on these hints, we aim to place new constraints on the age of the LB. We reconstruct the geometry and momentum of the LB using publicly available 3D dust maps to compare its geometry to that of the high-quality sample of simulated supernova remnants in the SISSI project. We find that, in contrast to previous estimates, $\gtrsim 20$ SNe over $\sim 4\,\text{Myr}$ are required to explain both the momentum and the size of the LB. The julia source-code for our analysis is made available at this https URL. Previous estimates of the age of the LB have seemingly overestimated its age and underestimated the number of SNe powering its expansion. Our results are in tension with the assumption that the LB is powered solely by SNe associated with the nearby Scorpius-Centraurus OB association, which appears to have stopped forming stars at about the same time as the LB began to expand. In light of this new evidence, our results cast serious doubts on the claim that star formation in the solar neighborhood was driven by the expansion of the LB, and might have instead quenched it.
#### The changing transit shape of TOI-3884 b

 - **Abstract**
 TOI-3884 b is a sub-Saturn transiting a fully convective M-dwarf. Observations indicate that the transit shape is chromatic and asymmetric as a result of persistent starspot crossings. This, along with the lack of photometric variability of the host star, indicates that the rotational axis of the star is tilted along our line of sight and the planet-occulted starspot is located close to the stellar pole. We acquired photometric transits over a period of three years with the Swiss 1.2-meter Euler telescope to track changes in the starspot configuration and detect any signs of decay or growth. The shape of the transit changes over time, and so far no two observations match perfectly. We conclude that the observed variability is likely not caused by changes in the temperature and size of the spot, but due to a slight (5.64 $\pm$ 0.64$^{\circ}$) misalignment between the spot center and the stellar pole, i.e., a small spin-spot angle ($\Theta$). In addition, we were able to obtain precise measurements of the sky-projected spin-orbit angle ($\lambda$) of 37.3 $\pm$ 1.5\degree, and the true spin-orbit angle ($\psi$) of 54.3 $\pm$ 1.4\degree. The precise alignment measurements along with future atmospheric characterisation with the James Webb Space Telescope will be vital for understanding the formation and evolution of close-in, massive planets around fully convective stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Current observations taken by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to observe the absorption features of icy mantles that cover interstellar dust grains, which are mainly composed of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, and $\mathrm{CO_2}$, along with other minor species. Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation. However, identifying the spectral features of the different species and quantifying the ice composition is not trivial and requires complex spectroscopic analysis. We present Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE), a new tool based on artificial neural networks. Based on the infrared (IR) ice absorption spectrum between 2.5 and 10 microns, AICE predicts the ice fractional composition in terms of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$, $\mathrm{NH_3}$, and $\mathrm{CH_4}$. To train the model, we used hundreds of laboratory experiments of ice mixtures from different databases, which were reprocessed with baseline subtraction and normalisation. Once trained, AICE takes less than one second on a conventional computer to predict the ice composition associated with the observed IR absorption spectrum, with typical errors of $\sim$3 $\%$ in the species fraction. We tested its performance on two spectra reported towards the NIR38 and J110621 background stars observed within the JWST Ice Age program, demonstrating a good agreement with previous estimations of the ice composition. The fast and accurate performance of AICE enables the systematic analysis of hundreds of different ice spectra with a modest time investment. In addition, this model can be enhanced and re-trained with more laboratory data, improving the precision of the predictions and expanding the list of predicted species.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a massive and potentially largest Ly$\alpha$ Nebula, RaJav, at z=2.25, associated with a quasar pair: the bright SDSS~J162029.07+433451.1 (hereafter J1620+4334) and the faint newly discovered quasar JPAS-9600-10844, at 2.265 $\pm$ 0.021 using the early data release (17 deg$^{2}$) of the J-PAS. The quasar JPAS-9600-10844 embedded in the nebula is located at ~ 60.2 kpc (7.3'') from J1620+4334, and shows a compact structure with broad emission lines (> 3000 km/s), typical of active galactic nuclei. At a 2$\sigma$ surface brightness (SB) contour of $\sim 1.86 \times 10^{-16}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$, the nebula extends > 100 kpcs and has a total Ly$\alpha$ luminosity of $\sim 7.7 \pm 0.6 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ signify the presence of a giant Enormous Ly$\alpha$ Nebula (ELAN). The nebula traces an over density of quasars at redshift of 2.2-2.3 consistent with the progenitor of a massive galaxy cluster. The extended CIV emission indicates that the circum-galactic medium (CGM) is metal-enriched and not primordial. The current J-PAS observations suggest photoionization and shocks due to outflows as possible ionization mechanisms. The faint extended FUV and NUV continuum emission likely points to ongoing star formation around the two quasars, suggesting a complex interaction in their environments. These findings provide new insights into the environment of quasars and their role in shaping the dynamics and evolution of the CGM at cosmic noon. Further spectroscopic observations will be required to fully characterize the object's nature and its kinematic properties. This study demonstrates the unique capability of J-PAS to detect massive and rare Ly$\alpha$ nebulae, providing new insights into their properties, environments, and connections to large-scale structures in the cosmic web such as filaments and overdensities in a large cosmological volume.
