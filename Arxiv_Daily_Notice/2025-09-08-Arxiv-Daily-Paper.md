 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery and characterization of a wide binary population in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Boötes I using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our sample consists of 52 candidate binaries with projected separations of 7,000 - 16,000 au and stellar masses from near the hydrogen-burning limit to the main-sequence turnoff ($\sim0.1$ - $0.8~{\rm M_\odot}$). By forward-modeling selection biases and chance alignments, we find that $1.25\pm0.25\%$ of Boötes I stars are members of wide binaries with separations beyond 5,000 au. This fraction, along with the distributions of separations and mass ratios, matches that in the Solar neighborhood, suggesting that wide binary formation is largely insensitive to metallicity, even down to [Fe/H] $\approx -2.5$. The observed truncation in the separation distribution near 16,000 au is well explained by stellar flyby disruptions. We also discuss how the binaries can be used to constrain the galaxy's dark matter properties. We show that our detection places new limits on primordial black hole dark matter, finding that compact objects with $M \gtrsim 5~{\rm M_\odot}$ cannot constitute more than $\sim1\%$ of the dark matter content. In contrast to previous work, we find that wide binaries are unlikely to provide robust constraints on the dark matter profile of ultrafaint galaxies given the uncertainties in the initial binary population, flyby disruptions, and contamination from chance alignments. These findings represent the most robust detection of wide binaries in an external galaxy to date, opening a new avenue for studying binary star formation and survival in extreme environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Episodic mass accretion is the dominant mechanism for mass assembly in the proto-stellar phase. Although prior optical time-domain searches have allowed detailed studies of individual outbursts, these searches remain insensitive to the earliest stages of star formation. In this paper, we present the characterization of two FU Orionis (FUor) outbursts identified using the combination of the ground-based, near-infrared Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) and the space-based, mid-infrared NEOWISE survey. Supplemented with near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up, we show that both objects are bona fide FUor type outbursts based on i) their proximity to star-forming regions, ii) large amplitude (2-4 magnitudes) infrared brightening over the last decade, iii) progenitor colors consistent with embedded (Class I) protostars, and iv) "mixed-temperature" infrared spectra exhibiting characteristic signatures of cool outer envelopes and a hot inner disk with a wind. While one source, WNTR24-cua, is a known FUor which we independently recover; the second source, WNTR24-egv, is a newly confirmed object. Neither source is detected in contemporaneous ground-based optical imaging, despite flux limits $\gtrsim 100\times$ fainter than their infrared brightness, demonstrating the capabilities of WINTER to identify heavily obscured young stellar object (YSO) outbursts. We highlight the capabilities of the Galactic Plane survey of the recently commissioned WINTER observatory in addressing the poorly understood FUor population with its unique combination of real-time detection capabilities, multi-color sensitivity, weekly cadence, and wide area coverage.

 - **Abstract**
 We review our current understanding of nuclear stellar discs (NSDs), rotating, and flattened stellar structures found in the central regions of both early- and late-type galaxies. We examine their demographics, kinematics, stellar populations, metallicity gradients and star formation histories. We derive scaling relations linking NSDs to properties of their host galaxies, and compare them with analogous relations for nuclear star clusters. The relationship between NSDs and other central galactic components, including nuclear rings, nuclear bars, and nuclear star clusters, is explored. The role of NSDs as tracers of the secular evolution of barred galaxies is highlighted, emphasising how they can be used to constrain properties of galactic bars such as their ages. Special attention is given to the Milky Way's NSD, which serves as a unique case study thanks to its proximity and the ability to resolve individual stars. The review covers the Milky Way's NSD structure, kinematics, dynamics and stellar content, addressing ongoing debates about the presence of a nuclear bar and implications of the latter for central gas dynamics. We argue that NSDs form by in-situ star formation, most of them because of bar-driven gas inflow, but possibly in some cases because of external acquisition of gas during a gas-rich merger. The review concludes by outlining open questions, future research directions and the exciting prospects provided by upcoming observational facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 We report Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) \hii\ imaging of NGC\,4141, the host galaxy of FRB\,20250316A at $z=0.0063$. Our GMRT \hii\ images have spatial resolutions, at $z\approx0.0063$, of $\approx0.48-8.0$~kpc, and find evidence for (i)~a companion galaxy, LEDA\,2582852, to the south-west, (ii)~a nearby (27-kpc distant) H{\sc{i}} cloud to the south-west, (iii)~disturbances in the H{\sc{i}} distributions of both NGC\,4141 and LEDA\,2582852, and (iv)~high H{\sc{i}} column densities in the south-western outskirts of NGC\,4141. A Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrum shows evidence for a low metallicity and a high star-formation rate (SFR) surface density activity in the south-western disk of NGC\,4141, while H$\alpha$-based SFR estimates over the last 10~Myr are higher than radio-based SFRs over the last 100~Myr. The above evidence indicates that NGC\,4141 has recently acquired metal-poor gas, via either a merger or accretion, that resulted in the south-western starburst and that may have also triggered large-scale star-formation activity in NGC\,4141, resulting in the formation of the stellar progenitor of FRB\,20250316A and the other transients. Our highest-resolution (480~pc) GMRT H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm image finds no H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm emission from the location of FRB\,20250316A or the nearby star-forming region, suggesting that most of the H{\sc{i}} here has been either ionized or converted into the molecular phase. Our non-detection of continuum emission at the location of FRB\,20250316A yields the $3\sigma$ upper limit $<3.2\times10^{25}$~erg~s$^{-1}$~Hz$^{-1}$, on the 1.4~GHz specific luminosity of a putative persistent radio source associated with FRB\,20250316A, one of the strongest constraints on the radio luminosity of such an associated persistent radio source.
#### SDSS-V LVM: Detectability of Wolf-Rayet stars and their He II ionizing flux in low-metallicity environments I. The weak-lined, early-type WN3 stars in the SMC

 - **Abstract**
 The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is the nearest low-metallicity dwarf galaxy. Its proximity and low reddening has enabled us to detect its Wolf-Rayet (WR) star population with 12 known objects. Quantitative spectroscopy of the stars revealed half of these WR stars to be strong sources of He ii ionizing flux, but the average metallicity of the SMC is below where WR bumps are usually detected in integrated galaxy spectra showing nebular He ii emission. Utilizing the Local Volume Mapper (LVM), we investigate regions around the six SMC WN3h stars, whose winds are thin enough to avoid He recombination and allow photons with > 54 eV to escape. Focusing on He ii 4686 Å, we show that the broad stellar wind component, the strongest optical diagnostic of the WN3h stars, is diluted within 24 pc in the integrated light from LVM, making the WR stars hard to detect in low-metallicity integrated regions. In addition, we compare the He ii ionizing flux from LVM with the values inferred from the stellar atmosphere code PoWR and find that the nebular emission around them only in some cases reflects the high amounts emitted by the stars. We conclude that early-type WN stars with comparably weak winds are viable sources to produce the observed He ii ionizing flux in low-metallicity galaxies. The easy dilution of the stellar signatures can explain the rareness of WR bump detections at 12 + log O/H < 8.0, while at the same time providing major candidates for the observed excess of nebular He ii emission. This constitutes a challenge for population synthesis models across all redshifts as the evolutionary path towards this observed WR population at low metallicity remains enigmatic.

 - **Abstract**
 Local galaxies follow scaling relations between mass and stellar population properties such as age and metallicity, which encode key information on their evolutionary histories. We revise these relations using the largest spectroscopic dataset from SDSS DR7 (0.005<z<0.22), improved Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS) models, aperture-corrections, and statistical weights to account for selection biases. In a Bayesian framework, we estimate stellar masses, mean ages, and metallicities by comparing spectral indices and photometry with composite SPS models. We adopt updated prescriptions for Star Formation Histories (SFH) and Chemical Enrichment Histories (CEH), while also testing different models and priors. We measure light-weighted ages for 354,977 galaxies (SNR>10) and metallicities for 89,852 galaxies (SNR>20), analyzing their dependence on stellar mass. Key findings include: i) A revised bimodal mass-age distribution, with a young sequence at low mass and an old sequence at high mass, partly overlapping in mass and transitioning at 10^10.8 solar masses. ii) A Mass-Metallicity Relation (MZR) shifted upwards by 0.2 dex relative to previous works. Aperture corrections lower masses, ages, and metallicities in a mass-dependent way, enhancing the young sequence and steepening the MZR. iii) Using Halpha-based SFRs, we found that while star-forming/young and quiescent/old correspondences generally hold, exceptions exist for many galaxies. Quiescent galaxies show a flatter, less scattered MZR than star-forming ones, with convergence at high mass. iv) SPS assumptions strongly affect our results, particularly SFHs and CEHs. These revised relations provide new benchmarks for galaxy evolution studies and simulations. Systematic uncertainties of 0.15 dex may arise from aperture biases and SPS modelling choices, highlighting the need for consistent assumptions when comparing observations and models.

 - **Abstract**
 We combine near-infrared imaging in two bands from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with archival observations of molecular gas to study SDSS J160705.16+533558.6 (J1607), an extremely luminous broad-line quasar at $z = 3.65$ that is also bright in the submillimeter (sub-mm). Via subtraction of the quasar point spread function, we show that its host galaxy is massive, with a stellar mass of $(5.8 \pm 3.0) \times 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$, making it comparable to giant early-type galaxies (ETGs) at $z\sim0$. If the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the quasar is accreting at the Eddington limit, then its mass is $3.5 \times 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, which is also consistent with local massive ETGs. The host has an extremely high star formation rate (SFR) of $4300 \pm 500$\sfr and a molecular gas mass of $(2.4 \pm 0.9)\times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. The quasar has two companions: one at a projected separation of 11 kpc with a stellar mass of $(7.9 \pm 5.0) \times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ but no detected molecular gas, and one 6 kpc further away in the same direction with a molecular gas mass of $(2.6 \pm 1.3) \times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ but no detected stellar emission. Since neither companion shows evidence for AGN activity, this may represent merger-driven quenching, in which the dynamics of the merger strip molecular gas from infalling galaxies. Overall, irrespective of whether the host is merging with the companions, these properties mark J1607 as forming what will become an extremely massive ($\sim10^{12}M_{\odot}$) galaxy by $z=0$.

 - **Abstract**
 As sites of some of the most efficient star formation in the Universe, globular clusters (GCs) have long been hypothesized to be the building blocks of young galaxies. Within the Milky Way, our best tracers of the contribution of GCs to the proto-Galaxy are stars with such anomalous overabundance in nitrogen and depletion in oxygen ("high-[N/O] stars") that they can be identified as having originated in a cluster long after they have escaped. We identify associations between these high-[N/O] field stars and GCs using integrals of motion and metallicities and compare to chemically typical halo stars to quantify any excess association, enabling a population-level exploration of the formation sites of the nitrogen-enhanced stars in the field. Relative to the halo as a whole, high-[N/O] stars show stronger associations with the most initially massive, inner Galaxy GCs, suggesting that many nitrogen-rich stars formed in these environments. However, when compared to a sample matched in orbital energy, the excess largely disappears: high-[N/O] stars are, on average, no more associated with surviving GCs than energy-matched halo stars, despite their [N/O] abundances indicating GC origins, consistent with a scenario in which a substantial fraction of low-energy inner-halo stars originate in GCs, so an energy-matched control dilutes any differential excess. We argue that associations between high-[N/O] stars and their parent GCs are further weakened because dynamical friction and the Galactic bar have altered integrals of motion, limiting the reliability of precise present-day associations and, especially, individual star-to-cluster tagging.

 - **Abstract**
 We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) integral-field spectroscopy of the nearby blue compact dwarf II Zw 40, which has a low metallicity of 25% of solar. Leveraging the high spatial/spectral resolution and wavelength coverage of JWST/NIRSpec, we present robust detections of the 3.3 um polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission on 20 pc scales. The strength of the Pf delta emission relative to the 3.3 PAH feature is significantly stronger than typical higher metallicity star-forming galaxies. We find that 3.3 um PAH emission is concentrated near the northern super star cluster and is co-spatial with CO gas. A strong correlation exists between the 3.3/11.3 PAH ratio and radiation hardness probed by NeIII/NeII, providing evidence of photodestruction of PAH molecules in intense radiation environments. Our analysis shows that while the overall PAH fraction is lower in II Zw 40 than in higher metallicity galaxies, the contribution of the 3.3 um PAH feature to the total PAH emission is higher. We propose that the PAH size distribution is fundamentally shaped by two competing mechanisms in low-metallicity environments: photo-destruction and inhibited growth. Additionally, the high radiation field intensity in II Zw 40 suggests that multi-photon heating of PAHs may be an important effect. As one of the first spatially resolved studies of aromatic emission in a low-metallicity environment, our spectroscopic results offer practical guidance for future observations of the 3.3 um PAH feature in low-metallicity galaxies using JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Clusters of galaxies are unique laboratories for investigating the dependence of galaxy evolution on their environment. The Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (HeViCS) mapped the central 84 square degrees region of the Virgo Cluster in five bands between 100 and 500 micron, which resulted in the first detailed view of cold dust in cluster galaxies. Major limitations of the HeViCS survey were the lack of data, or its limited availability, in the 20 to 80 micron range, and the quite low sensitivity of the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer instrument, resulting in poor constraints on the warmer dust component. The PRIMAger instrument onboard PRIMA offers the capability to map a large portion of the Virgo Cluster -- including regions beyond its virial radius -- in hyperspectral and polarimetric bands from 25 to 265 micron, enabling a direct comparison with the area previously covered by HeViCS. By combining PRIMA and Herschel data with existing multi-wavelength photometry, it becomes possible to explore the connection between stellar and dust properties in a complete sample of cluster galaxies, to investigate environmental effects on the warm dust component within the Virgo Cluster, to map the magnetic field structure of the cold interstellar medium (ISM), to search for dust emission from the intra-cluster medium, and to study the ISM in background galaxies projected behind the cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 Angular momentum transport in high-mass stars is commonly modeled by extrapolating the behavior of better-observed low-mass stars. According to the conventional picture, the cores of most black hole progenitors lose almost all of their angular momentum when their outer layers are ejected before core collapse. Accordingly, most black holes are expected to be born with dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\chi \lesssim 0.01$, even if some black holes are born with non-negligible spin due to tidal interactions in a progenitor binary. One might therefore expect to find a large fraction of $\chi \lesssim 0.01$ black holes in merging binary black hole (BBH) systems. We find that the conventional picture of angular momentum transport is in tension with data from LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA's fourth gravitational-wave transient catalog. We find no support for a sub-population of BBH systems with $\chi \lesssim 0.01$. Neither do we find support for a sub-population with only one spinning black hole as expected for tidal spin-up scenarios. Instead, we find evidence for two subpopulations in which both black holes have non-negligible spin. Approximately 84% of BBH systems contain two black holes with modest spins $\chi \approx 0.1$ and approximately 16% contain two black holes with large spins $\chi \approx 0.8$. These estimates come from our best-fit model, which is favored with natural log Bayes factors $\ln B \gtrsim 3$ over models that require a sub-population of $\chi \lesssim 0.01$ black holes, and models that do not contain multiple spin sub-populations. These results are difficult to reconcile with our current understanding of angular momentum transport.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence influences the structure and dynamics of molecular clouds, and plays a key role in regulating star formation. We therefore need methods to accurately infer turbulence properties of molecular clouds from position-position-velocity (PPV) spectral observations. A previous method calibrated with simulation data exists to recover the 3D turbulent velocity dispersion from PPV data. However, that method relies on optically-thin conditions, ignoring any radiative transfer (RT) and chemical effects. In the present study we determine how opacity, RT, and chemical effects influence turbulence measurements with CO lines. We post-process a chemo-dynamical simulation of a turbulent collapsing cloud with a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium line RT code to generate PPV spectral cubes of the CO (1-0) and CO (2-1) lines, and obtain moment maps. We isolate the turbulence in the first-moment maps by using a Gaussian smoothing approach. We compare the CO results with the optically-thin scenario to explore how line excitation and RT impact the turbulence measurements. We find that the turbulent velocity dispersion (sigma_v) measured via CO requires a correction by a factor R_CO, with R_CO,1-0 = 0.88 (+0.09, -0.08) for the CO (1-0) line and R_CO,2-1 = 0.88 (+0.10, -0.08) for the CO (2-1) line. As a consequence, previous measurements of sigma_v were overestimated by about 10-15% on average, with potential overestimates as high as 40%, taking the 1-sigma uncertainty into account.

 - **Abstract**
 To date, quantification of the on-sky motion for interstellar clouds have relied on proxies such as young stellar objects (YSO) and masers. We present the first direct measurement of an interstellar cloud proper motion using the VISTA Star Formation Atlas (VISIONS) multi-epoch infrared images of the Corona Australis star-forming region. Proper motions are extracted by tracking the morphology of extended structures in the cloud complex based on image registration techniques implemented in SimpleITK. Our determined values ($\mu_{\alpha^*} \sim +15$ mas/yr, $\mu_{\delta} \sim -30$ mas/yr) are in good agreement with those obtained for YSOs and young stellar clusters in the region. This study demonstrates the potential of image registration for directly mapping the kinematics of nearby molecular clouds, opening a new window into the study of cloud dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) are cold, dense structures representative of the initial conditions of star formation. Many studies of IRDCs employ CO to investigate cloud dynamics. However, CO can be highly depleted from the gas phase in IRDCs, impacting its fidelity as tracer. CO depletion is also of great interest in astrochemistry, since CO ice in dust grain mantles provides the raw material for forming complex organic molecules. We study CO depletion toward four IRDCs to investigate how it correlates with volume density and dust temperature, calculated from Herschel images. We use 13CO(1-0) and (2-1) maps to measure CO depletion factor, $f_D$, across IRDCs G23.46-00.53, G24.49-00.70, G24.94-00.15, and G25.16-00.28. We also consider a normalized CO depletion factor, f_D', which takes a value of unity, i.e., no depletion, in the outer, lower density, warmer regions. We then investigate the dependence of f_D and f_D' on gas density, $n_H$ and dust temperature, $T_{dust}$. We find CO depletion rises as density increases, reaching maximum values of f_D'$\sim$10 in regions with $n_H>3\times10^5\:{cm}^{-3}$, although with significant scatter at a given density. We find a tighter, less scattered relation of f_D' with temperature, rising rapidly for temperatures <18 K. We propose a functional form $f_D^\prime = \:{exp}(T_0/[T_{dust}-T_1])$ with $T_0\simeq4\:$K and $T_1\simeq12\:$K to reproduce this behaviour. We conclude that CO is heavily depleted from the gas phase in cold, dense regions of IRDCs. Thus CO depletion can lead to underestimation of total cloud masses based on CO line fluxes by factors up to 5. These results indicate a dominant role for thermal desorption in setting near equilibrium abundances of gas phase CO in IRDCs, providing important constraints for both astrochemical models and the chemodynamical history of gas during the early stages of star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse interstellar band (DIB) at 6196 A exhibits notable profile variations across the Milky Way. This study addresses three open issues: the unusual broadening of the DIB profile towards Upper Sco (USco), the lack of profile variations towards stars near $\eta$ Car, and the origin of the blueshift observed in Sco OB1. Using archival spectra of 453 early-type stars across the Galactic disk and in its proximity, we created a catalogue of the DIB's profile parameters. Our analysis identified Doppler-split components within the DIB profiles across most regions with no evidence for these splits being able to account for the observed broadening (23 km/s) in USco or other regions such as Orion, Vela OB2, and Melotte 20 ($\alpha$ Per cluster). We propose that neither the ages of the studied stellar populations nor the distances between clusters and nearby clouds significantly contribute to the broadening. However, we detect a gradient in the full width at half maximum within the Sco-Cen and Orion regions, where broadening decreases with distance from the star-forming centres. This result points to a possible connection between the DIB broadening and star formation (likely via the impact of recent supernovae). Regarding the Carina Nebula, we confirm the lack of DIB profile variations in a small region near $\eta$ Car, although an adjacent southern area exhibits significant variations, comparable to those in USco. In addition to the Carina Nebula, we find that the Rosette Nebula and NGC 6405 also show consistently narrow profiles (<20 km/s) with minimal deviations from the median over spatial scales of a few parsecs. Finally, regarding the origin of the blueshift observed in Sco OB1, we used a comparison with the Lagoon Nebula and argue that the most natural explanation is the presence of an unresolved kinematic component in the profile of the DIB, shifting the measured centre of the band.

 - **Abstract**
 From 2002 to 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys has suffered in the harsh radiation environment above the protection of the Earth's atmosphere. We track the degradation of its image quality, as Solar protons and galactic cosmic rays have damaged its photosensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging sensors. The damage is consistent with defects in the silicon lattice that have all annealed into one of three configurations. The rate of damage in low Earth orbit is modulated by $18.5^{+4.5}_{-0.5}$ per cent during an 11 year Solar cycle, peaking $430^{+11}_{-5}$ days after Solar minimum as recorded in the number of sunspots. We also present the open-source Algorithm for Charge Transfer Inefficiency correction (ArCTIc) v7. This models the (instantaneous or gradual) capture of photoelectrons into lattice defects, and their release after (a discrete set or continuum of) characteristic time delays, which creates spurious trailing in an image. Calibrated using the trailing of hot pixels, and applied during post-processing of astronomical images, ArCTIc can correct 99.5% of Charge Transfer Inefficiency trailing averaged over the camera's lifetime, and 99.9% of trailing in the worst-affected recent data.

 - **Abstract**
 T CrB is a nearby symbiotic binary and a recurrent nova with a period of ca. 80 years. The next eruption is expected to take place in 2025 or 2026. We present our pre-eruption observations made in ALMA frequency Bands 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 in August to November 2024 and constrain the properties of the environment into which the imminent next nova will erupt. We find that in the second half of 2024, the quiescent T CrB was a faint mm source with a spectral energy distribution well described by a powerlaw with index $\alpha=$0.56$\pm$0.11 and a flux density of ca. 0.1 mJy at 44 GHz and 0.4 mJy at 400 GHz. There is no significant line emission. This is in agreement with expectations for free-free emission from the partially ionized wind of the red giant donor star and, in extrapolation to 35 GHz, a factor 5 fainter than the emission observed in 2016/17 during the latest high state. Comparing the spectra from that high-state between 13.5 GHz and 35 GHz with our spectrum from 2024, our spectrum is softer. The spectral index is on average lower by 0.34$\pm$0.11 . Our per-band and aggregate bandwidth images of T CrB show an unresolved point source with no evidence for extended structure. A simple model of a free-free emitting, fully-ionized stellar wind seems to describe well the 2016/17 high state of T CrB but not our 2024 ALMA measurements with their low flux and high turnover frequency suggesting that in 2024, the wind was far from fully ionized.

 - **Abstract**
 The quenching of star formation in galaxies is an important aspect of galaxy evolution, but the physical mechanisms that drive it are still not understood. Measuring the spatial distribution of quenching can help determine these mechanisms. We present the star-formation histories (SFHs) and stellar metallicity evolution of rapidly quenched regions in 86 local post-starburst (PSB) galaxies from the MaNGA integral field survey, obtained through Bayesian full spectral fitting of their rest-frame optical spectra. We found that regardless of spatial location, the PSB regions have similar past SFHs and chemical evolution, once radial metallicity gradients are accounted for. This suggests that all PSB regions are regulated by a common set of local scale processes in the interstellar medium, regardless of the broader triggering mechanism. We show that the centres of galaxies with outer PSB regions are also quenching. The central specific star-formation rate (sSFR) has declined by $\sim1.0\;$dex on average during the last 2 Gyr, a significantly steeper decline than main sequence galaxies over the same period ($\approx0.2\;$dex). This central quenching can be either synchronous, outside-in or inside-out, and slower or as fast as the outer regions, highlighting the diversity of quenching pathways for local galaxies. Our results imply a primary quenching mechanism that is both catastrophic and global in rapidly halting star formation in local galaxies. We suggest the predominant cause is galaxy mergers or interactions, with large scale feedback from a starburst or a central supermassive black hole playing a lesser role.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the milliarcsecond localization of a high (1379 pc/cc) dispersion measure (DM) repeating fast radio burst, FRB 20190417A. Combining European VLBI Network detections of five repeat bursts, we confirm the FRB's host to be a low-metallicity, star-forming dwarf galaxy at z = 0.12817, analogous to the hosts of FRBs 20121102A, 20190520B and 20240114A. We also show that FRB 20190417A is spatially coincident with a compact, luminous persistent radio source (PRS). Visibility-domain model fitting constrains the transverse physical size of the PRS to < 23.1 pc and yields an integrated flux density of 191(39) microJy at 1.4 GHz. Though we do not find significant evidence for DM evolution, FRB 20190417A exhibits a time-variable rotation measure (RM) ranging between +3958(11) and +5061(24) rad/m2 over three years. We find no evidence for intervening galaxy clusters in the FRB's line-of-sight and place a conservative lower limit on the rest-frame host DM contribution of 1212.0 pc/cc (90% confidence) -- the largest known for any FRB so far. This system strengthens the emerging picture of a rare subclass of repeating FRBs with large and variable RMs, above-average host DMs, and luminous PRS counterparts in metal-poor dwarf galaxies. We explore the role of these systems in the broader FRB population, either as the youngest or most extreme FRB sources, or as a distinct engine for FRB emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a hybrid active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback model that features three accretion disc states (the thick, thin, and slim discs at low, moderate, and super-Eddington accretion rates, respectively), and two feedback modes: thermal isotropic and kinetic jets. The model includes black hole (BH) spin evolution due to gas accretion, BH mergers, jet spindown, and Lense-Thirring torques. The BH spin determines the jet directions and affects the feedback efficiencies. The model is implemented in the SWIFT code and coupled with the COLIBRE galaxy formation model. We present the first results from hybrid AGN feedback simulations run as part of the COLIBRE suite, focusing on the impact of new parameters and calibration efforts. Using the new hybrid AGN feedback model, we find that AGN feedback affects not just massive galaxies, but all galaxies down to $M_*\approx10^8$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$. BH spins are predicted to be near-maximal for intermediate-mass BHs ($M_\mathrm{BH}\in[10^6,10^8]$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$), and lower for other BH masses. These trends are in good agreement with observations. The intergalactic medium is hotter and impacted on larger scales in the hybrid AGN feedback simulations compared to those using purely thermal feedback. In the hybrid AGN simulations, we predict that half of the cumulative injected AGN energy is in thermal and the other half in jet form, broadly independent of BH mass and redshift. Jet feedback is important at all redshifts and dominates over thermal feedback at $z<0.5$ and $z>1.5$, but only mildly.
#### Improving Solar Flare Nowcasting with the Hot Onset Precursor Event (HOPE) Technique

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the statistical behavior of plasma properties during Hot Onset Precursor Events (HOPEs) of solar flares and evaluates their potential for improving flare nowcasting. Two datasets are analyzed: (a) new Soft X-Ray (SXR) spectra of 25 flares (C2.6 to M1.0) obtained from the Dual-zone Aperture X-ray Solar Spectrometer (DAXSS), and (b) SXR irradiance data from 137 flares (C5.0 to X7.1) recorded by the X-Ray Sensor on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-XRS). Plasma temperature, emission measure (EM), and low First Ionization Potential (e.g., Mg, Si, Fe) elemental abundance factors (AFs) are derived from DAXSS using Astrophysical Plasma Emission Code model fitting. Isothermal plasma temperature and emission measure are derived from GOES-XRS using the XRS-A/XRS-B ratio method. Results indicate that the HOPE phase exhibits elevated temperatures (10-15 MK) and an order-of-magnitude increase in EM before the impulsive phase. Elemental AFs show a transition from coronal to photospheric values as the flare progresses. Using GOES-XRS data, we develop an improved nowcasting algorithm that detects flares utilizing HOPE signatures. The algorithm is tested across three categories of flares (C5.0-M1.0, M1.0-X1.0, and X1.0+), consistently predicting flare alerts 5-15 minutes ahead of the flare peak. We also explore the possibility of approximate flare magnitude prediction, by calculating correlation between onset parameters and flare peak magnitude. This HOPE-based system shows potential for earlier warnings than current NOAA R3 alerts, which could be useful for High-frequency communication systems operators and targeted flare observation campaigns.
#### Rethinking mass transfer: a unified semi-analytical framework for circular and eccentric binaries. I. Orbital evolution due to conservative mass transfer

 - **Abstract**
 Mass transfer (MT) is a fundamental process in stellar evolution. While MT in circular orbits is well studied, observations indicate that it also occurs in eccentric ones. To date, no framework simultaneously accounts for both conservative and non-conservative MT across arbitrary eccentricities while also incorporating the donor star`s spin. We present a new semi-analytic framework for the secular orbital evolution of mass-transferring binaries, treating stars as extended bodies and accounting for the donor star`s spin. The model is applicable to both circular and eccentric orbits and accommodates conservative and non-conservative MT across a broad range of mass ratios and stellar spins. We derive secular, orbit-averaged equations describing the orbital evolution by treating MT, mass loss, and angular momentum loss as perturbations to the general two-body problem. Assuming conservative MT, we compare our results to previous models and validate them against numerical integrations. Our model predicts stronger orbital widening at a given mass ratio than previous models. For circular orbits, we find that the transitional mass ratio $q_{trans,a}$, which separates orbital widening from shrinkage, increases from $q_{trans,a} = 1$ up to $q_{trans,a} \sim 1.5$ when accounting for extended bodies. For eccentric orbits, the model predicts a broader parameter space for both orbital widening and eccentricity pumping. We find that stable MT naturally explains the observed correlation between longer orbital periods and higher eccentricities, providing a robust mechanism for the formation of wide and eccentric post-interaction binaries. Our model can be integrated into binary evolution and population synthesis codes to consistently treat conservative and non-conservative MT in arbitrarily eccentric orbits with applications ranging from MT on the main sequence to gravitational-wave progenitors.
