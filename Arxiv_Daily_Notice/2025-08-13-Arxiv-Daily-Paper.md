#### On bursty star formation during cosmological reionization -- influence on the metal and dust content of low-mass galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Observations indicate that high-redshift galaxies undergo episodic star formation bursts, driving strong outflows that expel gas and suppress accretion. We investigate the consequences for metal and dust content of galaxies at $z\geq\!5$ using our semi-analytical model, ASHVINI. We track gas-phase and stellar metallicities $(Z_\text{g}, Z_\star)$ and dust mass $(M_{\rm d})$ in dark matter haloes spanning $M_{\rm h} = 10^6 - 10^{11}\,M_\odot$, comparing continuous and bursty star formation scenarios, which reflect underlying assumptions of instantaneous and delayed feedback, and we allow for metallicity-dependent feedback efficiency. Delayed feedback induces oscillations in $Z_{\rm g}$ and $Z_\star$, with $Z_{\rm g}$ declining sharply at low stellar and halo masses. This decline shifts to higher stellar and halo masses as the redshift decreases. Reionization introduces significant scatter, producing an upturn followed by rapid $Z_{\rm g}$ decline. Metallicity-dependent feedback moderates this decline at $z=7-10$, flattening the $Z_{\rm g}$-mass relation to $\simeq 0.03 - 0.04\,Z_\odot$. Dust production tracks $Z_{\rm g}$ but is sensitive to burst history, causing delayed enrichment. Our results show that burst-driven feedback decouples $Z_{\rm g}$ and $Z_\star$, imprints intrinsic scatter in mass-metallicity relations, and delays dust growth. These effects are strongest in low-mass halos $(M_{\rm h}\sim 10^7\,M_\odot)$, where shallow potentials amplify the impact of feedback. Our results are consistent with recent hydrodynamical and semi-analytical simulations and provides context for interpreting JWST metallicity and dust measurements, highlighting the importance of episodic star formation in early galaxy chemical evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We combine James Webb Space Telescope images of the nearby galaxy NGC 5194 in the hydrogen recombination line Pa-alpha (lambda=1.8756 micron) from the Cycle 1 program JWST-FEAST with 21 micron dust continuum images from the Cycle 2 Treasury program JWGT to quantify the difference in the calibration of mid-infrared star formation rates (SFR) between HII regions and galaxies. We use the archival HST H-alpha image to correct the Pa-alpha emission for the effects of dust attenuation. Our data confirm previous results that the dust-corrected Pa-alpha flux is tightly correlated with the 21 micron emission at the scales of HII regions. When combined with published JWST data for the HII regions of the galaxy NGC 628 and Spitzer 24 micron data for whole galaxies and for kpc-size galaxy regions, we show that the L(24)-L(Pa-alpha) correlation has exponent >1 across six decades in luminosity. In addition, the hybrid 24 micron+H-alpha SFR indicator has a scaling constant about 4.4 times higher for HII regions than for whole galaxies, also in agreement with previous results. Models of stellar populations with a range of star formation histories reveal that the observed trends can be entirely ascribed to and quantified with the contribution to the IR emission by stellar populations older than ~5-6 Myr. Based on the models' results, we provide: (1) a calibration for the infrared SFR across six orders of magnitude in L(24), from HII regions to luminous galaxies, and (2) a prescription for the scaling constant of the hybrid infrared SFR indicators as a function of the star formation timescale.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep and wide-field near-infrared (NIR) surveys have recently discovered and confirmed ultramassive galaxies (UMGs; $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})>11$) spectroscopically at high redshift. However, most are characterized using only ultraviolet (UV)-to-NIR photometry, offering limited insight into obscured star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. In this work, we add ten far-infrared (FIR)-to-radio passbands to the existing UV-to-NIR catalogs for two spectroscopically confirmed UMGs from the MAGAZ3NE survey, COS-DR3-195616 ($z_{\rm spec} = 3.255$) and COS-DR1-209435 ($z_{\rm spec} = 2.481$). Utilizing the full UV-to-radio photometry, we revise our earlier UV-NIR-based interpretation of the nature of these galaxies. While both were previously identified as quiescent, our analysis reveals that 195616 is an unobscured galaxy undergoing quenching, and 209435 is a heavily obscured, actively star-forming UMG. We find that 195616 has already depleted most of its molecular gas and is expected to experience minimal future stellar mass growth. In contrast, 209435 contains a substantial molecular gas reservoir and has a prolonged depletion timescale. It is anticipated to increase 0.34 dex in stellar mass, reaching a stellar mass of $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})$ = 11.72 over the next 0.72 Gyr. We present multi-pronged evidence for AGN activity in both UMGs. Our findings support a scenario where AGN feedback in 195616 may have contributed to gas depletion during quenching, while 209435 continues to form stars despite hosting an obscured AGN, suggesting feedback has not yet suppressed star formation. Our work shows the importance of FIR-to-radio observations for accurately inferring the nature and properties of galaxies at $z\gtrsim3$.
#### Accretion is All You Need: Black Hole Spin Alignment in Merger GW231123 Indicates Accretion Pathway

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123 represents the most massive binary-black-hole merger detected to date, lying firmly within, or even above, the pair-instability mass gap. The component spins are both exceptionally high ($a_1 = 0.90^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$, $a_2 = 0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$), which is difficult to explain with repeated mergers. Here we show that the black hole spin vectors are closely aligned with each other while significantly tilted relative to the binary's orbital angular momentum, pointing to a common accretion-driven origin. We examine astrophysical formation channels capable of producing near-equal, high-mass, and mutually aligned spins consistent with GW231123 -- particularly binaries embedded in AGN disks and Pop~III remnants, which grew via coherent misaligned gas accretion. We further argue that other high-mass, high-spin events, e.g., GW190521 may share a similar evolutionary pathway. These findings underscore the critical role of sustained, coherent accretion in shaping the most extreme black hole binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the number density of massive ($ \mathrm{ log (M_{*}/M_{\odot}) > 10.3} $) quiescent galaxies at $2<z<5$ using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectra. This work relies on spectra from RUBIES, which provides excellent data quality and an unparalleled, well-defined targeting strategy to robustly infer physical properties and number densities. We identify quiescent galaxy candidates within RUBIES through principal component analysis and construct a final sample using star formation histories derived from spectro-photometric fitting of the NIRSpec PRISM spectra and NIRCam photometry. By inverting the RUBIES selection function, we correct for survey incompleteness and calculate the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at these redshifts, providing the most complete spectroscopic estimates prior to cosmic noon to date. We find that early massive quiescent galaxies are surprisingly common ($\gtrsim 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ by $4<z<5$), which is consistent with previous studies based on JWST photometry alone and/or in smaller survey areas. We compare our number densities with predictions from six state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy formation simulations. At $z>3$, most simulations fail to produce enough massive quiescent galaxies, suggesting the treatment of feedback and/or the channels for early efficient formation are incomplete in most galaxy evolution models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a kinematic study of young stars in Messier 16 (M16) using the Gaia Data Release 3 and high-resolution spectra. A total of 345 stars are selected as genuine members using the published lists of X-ray, infrared sources, and early-type stars as well as the Gaia data. There is severe differential reddening across this region and the reddening law of the intracluster medium appears abnormal. The distance to M16, derived from the parallaxes of the members, is about 1.7 kpc. The ages of members, estimated by comparing their color-magnitude diagram with theoretical isochrones, range from 1 Myr to 4 Myr. This star-forming region is composed of an open cluster (NGC 6611) and a distributed population. This cluster shows a clear pattern of expansion and rotation. Some of the distributed population are spatially associated with the gas pillars located at the ridge of H II bubble. In particular, several stars moving away from the cluster are physically associated with the northeastern pillar. In addition, their younger ages support the idea that the formation of these stars was triggered by the feedback from massive stars in NGC 6611. On the other hand, the other stars do not show systematic radial or stream motions; therefore, they likely formed through spontaneous star formation events. We discuss the formation of young stars in the context of cluster expansion, spontaneous star formation, and feedback-driven star formation, and suggest that all of these mechanisms possibly contributed to their formation.
#### C3PO V: Comoving Pairs Indicate Rotational Spin-Down Drives the Main-Sequence Li-Dip

 - **Abstract**
 The lithium-dip observed in mid-F dwarfs remains a long-standing challenge for stellar evolution models. We present high-precision stellar parameters and A(Li) for 22 new comoving pairs, primarily located on the hotter side of the Li-Dip. Combined with pairs from the C3PO catalog, our sample includes 124 stars with Teff between 6000 and 7300 K, encompassing and extending slightly beyond the Li-Dip. Among them, 49 comoving pairs (98 stars) have both components within the temperature range of interest. Using this expanded set of comoving pairs observed with high-resolution spectroscopy, we show that rotational spin-down is the dominant process responsible for Li depletion in the Li-Dip. First, within comoving pairs, the star with v sin i > 12 km/s shows higher A(Li) than its more slowly rotating companion within the Li-Dip, indicating that rotation-dependent mixing drives lithium depletion. Second, we observe a correlation between A(Li) and v sin i: fast rotators retain higher A(Li) with less scatter, while slow rotators show lower A(Li) and greater dispersion. Third, among slow rotators, A(Li) varies widely, suggesting that differences in initial rotation rates and spin-down histories influence how much Li is depleted. Some stars may have formed as fast rotators and spun down rapidly, leading to more Li depletion, while others may have started as slow rotators and retained more of their initial Li. These results demonstrate that rotational induced mixing plays an important role in shaping the Li-Dip beyond the effects of stellar age and mass.
#### Pushchino multibeam pulsar search. VII. The results of the timing of 12 slow pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 We have performed timing of a number of known slow pulsars with poorly known coordinates and parameters of their intrinsic rotation. We used data from the archive of round-the-clock monitoring observations on the third (stationary) beam pattern of the Large Phased Array radio telescope (LPA LPI) at a frequency of 111 MHz, which has an unsatisfactory connection of the local quartz time standards to the reference scale (UTC). To compensate for the resulting errors, we applied an algorithm previously developed by us, which uses Pulsar Timescale as an intermediate reference scale to compute corrections to the pulses Times of Arrival (TOAs) measured by the local clocks and to switch to UTC. Analyzing a ten-year observational data set we substantially refined the rotational and astrometric parameters of 12 pulsars. The spin frequencies $\nu$ and their first derivatives $\dot\nu$ were determined with accuracies of $10^{-10}$ Hz and $10^{-19}$ s$^{-2}$, respectively, which is 5-6 orders of magnitude better than the values quoted in the catalogue. The coordinates are determined with accuracies ranging from units to tens of arcseconds.
#### Relation between colour gradient and central asymmetric features for post-starburst galaxies at $z \sim 0.8$

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08741

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated colour gradients of photometrically selected post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) at $0.7 < z < 0.9$ in the COSMOS field as a function of central concentration of asymmetric features, $C_{A}$, in order to understand their origins. We measured the colour gradients for 33 PSBs, 332 quiescent galaxies (QGs), and 1136 star-forming gaaxies (SFGs) by using COSMOS $HST$/ACS $I_{F814W}$-band and COSMOS-DASH $HST$/WFC3 $H_{F160W}$-band data. We found that the colour gradient, $\Delta (I-H) = (I-H)_{in} - (I-H)_{out}$, decreases with increasing $C_{A}$ for all the three populations. Only PSBs with $\log{C_{A}} > 0.6$ show positive gradients, which suggests that their central asymmetric features are caused by disturbed distribution of relatively young stars near the centre. The colour gradients are also closely related with half-light radius rather than stellar mass for all the populations. The positive colour gradients and very small sizes of those PSBs with high $C_A$ suggest that a nuclear starburst caused by gas-rich major merger occurred in the recent past. On the other hand, similarly massive PSBs with $\log C_A < 0.6$ show the negative colour gradients, heavier dust extinction, and larger sizes, and their origins may be different from those PSBs with high $C_A$.
#### Evidence for optical pulsations from a redback millisecond pulsar

 - **Abstract**
 Recent detections of optical pulsations from both a transitional and an accreting millisecond pulsar have revealed unexpectedly bright signals, suggesting that the presence of an accretion disk enhances the efficiency of optical emission, possibly via synchrotron radiation from accelerated particles. In this work, we present optical observations of the redback millisecond pulsar PSR J2339-0533, obtained with the SiFAP2 photometer mounted on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. Data accumulated during the campaign with the longest exposure time (12 hr) suggest that its $\sim$18 mag optical counterpart exhibits pulsations at the neutron star's spin frequency. This candidate signal was identified by folding the optical time series using the pulsar ephemeris derived from nearly simultaneous observations with the 64-m Murriyang (Parkes) radio telescope. The detection significance of the candidate optical signal identified in those data lies between 2.9 and 3.5 $\sigma$, depending on the statistical test employed. The pulsed signal has a duty cycle of $\approx 1/32$, and the de-reddened pulsed magnitude in the V band is $(26.0 \pm 0.6)$ mag. At a distance of 1.7 kpc, this corresponds to a conversion efficiency of $\sim 3 \times 10^{-6}$ of the pulsar's spin-down power into pulsed optical luminosity, comparable to values observed in young, isolated pulsars like the Crab, but 50-100 times lower than in disk-accreting millisecond pulsars. If confirmed, these findings suggest that optical pulsations arise independently of an accretion disk and support the notion that such disks boost the optical emission efficiency.
#### Stable Collisionless Tori Around Kerr Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 In low luminosity active galactic nuclei like M87$^*$ and Sgr A$^*$, the accretion flow in the vicinity of the black hole is in the collisionless regime, meaning that the collisional mean free path of charged particles is much larger than the dynamic length scales. To properly model the particle energization and emission from the collisionless accretion flow, a promising approach is to employ the global general relativistic particle-in-cell simulations -- a newly developed, fully kinetic, first-principles method. However, it has been challenging to set up an initial condition that involves collisionless gas with finite angular momentum. We present, for the first time, a class of analytic kinetic equilibria of collisionless tori around a Kerr black hole. We have successfully implemented the collisionless tori in our GPU-based GRPIC code framework Aperture, and found them to be stable for hundreds to thousands of dynamical times in 2D axisymmetric simulations when there is no initial seed magnetic field. These kinetic equilibria serve as ideal starting points for future studies of the physics of collisionless accretion and jet launching.

 - **Abstract**
 Line intensity mapping (LIM) is an emerging technique for probing the large scale structure (LSS) in the post-reionisation era. This captures the integrated flux of a particular spectral line emission from multiple sources within a patch of the sky without resolving them. Mapping different galaxy line emissions, such as the HI $21$-cm and CO rotational lines via LIM, can reveal complementary information about the bias with which the line emitters trace the underlying matter distribution and how different astrophysical phenomena affect the clustering pattern of these signals. The stage where the structures in the cosmic web merge to form a single connected structure is known as the percolation transition. Using mock HI $21$-cm and CO($1-0$) LIM signals in the post-reionisation universe, we explore the connectivity of structures through percolation analysis and compare it with that of the underlying galaxy distribution. We probe the relative contributions of voids, filaments, and sheets to the galaxy density and line intensity maps using a morphological measure known as the local dimension. The CO($1-0$) map exhibits an increased filamentary behaviour and larger contribution from sheets than the $21$-cm map. We attempt to explain such an emission of the CO($1-0$) line from biased environments. The upcoming SKA-Mid will produce tomographic intensity maps of the $21$-cm signal at $z \lesssim 3$ in Band-1. CO maps can be produced at these redshifts in phase 2 of SKA-Mid, where the frequency coverage is expected to increase up to $\sim 50$ GHz. We present forecasts for the recovery of the local dimensions of these intensity maps contaminated by instrumental noise, considering SKA-Mid observations.
#### Dynamical properties of high-[Mg/Fe] stars in the Milky Way bar region

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the high-alpha component of the Galactic bulge remains debated, unlike the bar-driven origin of the low-alpha bulge. We examine the metallicity-dependent dynamical properties of high-[Mg/Fe] stars in the bar region, using samples of low- and high-[Mg/Fe] stars from APOGEE DR17, complemented by the PIGS catalogue of [Fe/H] $ < -1 $ stars. The mean Galactocentric rotational velocity $ \overline V_\phi(R) $ is nearly cylindrical for both low- and high-[Mg/Fe] stars across the bulge and outer bar. $\overline V_\phi(R)$ of high-[Mg/Fe] stars with [Fe/H] $ \ge -0.6 $ is similar within errors to low-[Mg/Fe] stars in the bulge, and $ 10-20\% $ lower in the outer bar. The mean radial velocity field of these stars exhibits a quadrupole pattern similar to low-[Mg/Fe] stars. Orbit integrations in realistic barred Galactic potentials show that these model-independent properties correspond to a peanut bulge in the orbital density distributions for high-[Mg/Fe] stars with [Fe/H] $ \ge -0.6 $, transitioning toward a more spheroidal structure at lower metallicities. Additionally, $ \overline V_\phi$ ([Fe/H]) increases steeply as metallicity rises from about [Fe/H] $ \sim -1.3 $, resembling the spin-up observed at larger Galactic radii. This is accompanied by a transition in the dominant orbit families, from co- and counter-rotating cloud A and $ \rm x_4 $ orbits at low metallicities to co-rotating bar-supporting $ \rm x_1 $ family tree, box, and cloud A orbits at solar metallicity. Our results strengthen the case that the bulk of the high-[Mg/Fe] component in the bar region evolved from an alpha-enhanced disc, while metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] $ < -1 $ trace a more turbulent origin.

 Aims. We aim to identify and classify BCs using high-precision astrometric and kinematic data, and to investigate their physical properties, mutual gravitational interactions, and formation rates. Methods. We used a comprehensive star cluster catalog that contains 4,084 high-quality clusters. Based on spatial and kinematic proximity, we identified 400 cluster pairs involving 686 unique clusters. These pairs were classified into three types: primordial BCs, systems formed through tidal capture or resonant trapping, and hyperbolic encounter pairs. For each system, we calculated the tidal factor to quantify the strength of mutual tidal interaction. Additionally, we constructed multi-cluster systems by identifying transitive connections among cluster pairs. Results. Among the 400 identified cluster pairs, nearly 60.8% (243 pairs) are probably primordial BCs, exhibiting both similar ages and motions. This supports a scenario where they formed together in the same giant molecular cloud. We find that 82.5% of the cluster pairs have strong mutual tidal forces. In addition, 278 star clusters are identified as members of 82 multi-cluster systems, including 27 newly reported groups. Cross-matching with the literature confirms the recovery of previously reported systems and leads to the discovery of 268 new cluster pairs. In our sample, about 16.8% of star clusters are involved in some type of interaction with another cluster, and 9.94% of star clusters are likely born in primordial BCs. Conclusions. Our results provide a comprehensive, homogeneously identified sample of Galactic BCs. The high fraction of primordial BCs and their mutual tidal interaction suggest that cluster formation in pairs is a main outcome of star formation. This work offers new observational constraints on the formation and dynamical evolution of multiple star cluster systems.
