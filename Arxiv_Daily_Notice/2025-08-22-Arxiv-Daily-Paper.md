 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift galaxies exhibit compact regions of intense star formation, known as ``clumps,'' which are conspicuous in the rest-frame ultraviolet. Studying them can shed light on how they form and evolve and inform theoretical models of galaxy evolution. We examine the evolution of clumpy galaxies with redshift and stellar mass over $2<z<12$ with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging from the JWST Advanced Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Off-center clumps are detected in the rest-frame near-ultraviolet (NUV) using similar techniques to those in earlier studies based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. This is done for a sample of 9,121 star-forming galaxies with stellar masses $\log\left(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\right) \geq 8$. The fraction of clumpy galaxies, $f_{\rm{clumpy}}$, increases from $\sim20\%$ at $z>6.5$ to $\sim80\%$ at $z\sim2.75$ at $\log\left(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\right) \geq 9$. Our $f_{\rm{clumpy}}$ values are generally higher at fixed redshift and increase faster with decreasing redshift than what studies based on HST data found, which we attribute largely to the higher sensitivity of JWST. Clumps make up $15-20\%$ of the NUV luminosity of clumpy galaxies, with little dependence on redshift or stellar mass. $f_{\rm{clumpy}}$ correlates with stellar mass and there is little correlation with specific star-formation rate. Our $f_{\rm{clumpy}}$ measurements are compared with those from simulations as well as other observations. At low redshifts ($z\lesssim5.75$) and intermediate-to-high stellar masses ($\log\left(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\right) \geq 9$), our results suggest gas fragmentation due to violent disk instabilities to be the dominant mechanism for forming clumps. At high redshifts and low stellar masses, compression of gas during mergers appears to dominate.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have revealed star-forming regions as possible origin sites of very-high-energy (TeV) cosmic rays, not associated with supernova remnants. Colliding-wind binaries (CWBs) are strong X-ray and radio synchrotron emitters and have been proposed as potential accelerators of such particles. We perform high-resolution three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations coupled with test-particle integration to investigate how local plasma conditions affect particle acceleration in CWBs. We find that the maximum particle energies and the hardness of the energy distributions depend on the shock magnetization and cooling efficiency. For moderate magnetization ($\gt$1 G), CWBs can accelerate hadronic particles up to hundreds of TeV or even PeV energies, with more than 1\% of particles reaching the very-high-energy range. By correlating the local acceleration rate with plasma quantities - \textit{magnetic field strength, current density, vorticity, and velocity divergence} - we show that turbulence and magnetic field complexity dominate the acceleration, while classical diffusive shock acceleration plays a limited role. These results suggest that turbulent, magnetically driven processes are key to producing relativistic particles in CWBs, with implications for future high sensitivity $\gamma$-ray observations (e.g. LACT and CTAO).

 - **Abstract**
 SCUPOL, the polarimeter for SCUBA on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), was used for polarization observations of 104 regions at 850 micron wavelength and 15 arcsec resolution in the mapping mode by Matthews et al. (2009). They presented the polarization values and magnetic field morphologies in these regions. In this work, we took the opportunity to use this big legacy survey data to investigate further the collective statistical properties of the measured polarization in different star-forming regions containing cores and filaments. We did not reproduce the polarization maps but used the polarization value catalogs to investigate the statistics of distributions. In some of these regions, the data from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) polarization observation at 1.3 mm wavelength and 2.5 arcsec resolution were also available from the TADPOL survey (Hull et al., 2014). We used that data and compared it with JCMT/SCUPOL values. We also study how the direction of outflows appears to relate to the mean B-field direction from large scale (JCMT observation at 15 arcsec) to small scale (CARMA observation at 2.5 arcsec) for the nine core regions common in both.

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-ray emission (DGE) provides a valuable probe for investigating the cosmic ray propagation and interactions within our Galactic environment. Recent observations have demonstrated systematic excesses of DGE compared with the conventional cosmic-ray propagation model predictions. While $\gamma$-ray emissions have been detected in a subset of globular clusters, their undetected populations may significantly contribute to the DGE. Motivated by this possibility, we present a comprehensive assessment of potential contributions from unresolved globular clusters to the DGE. In our analysis, a nonparametric method is employed to estimate the luminosity function and spatial distribution function of globular clusters using the Fermi-LAT fourth source catalog (4FGL) combined with a reference globular cluster catalog. Based on these distributions, we calculate the cumulative contribution of unresolved globular cluster populations to the DGE observed by Fermi-LAT and the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Our results reveal that globular clusters account for only $\sim$2\% of the DGE at the TeV range, and smaller than $1\%$ in the GeV regime, which is effectively negligible.
#### The Missing Giant: Do FAST Spectroscopic Observations Reveal a Scarcity of Large Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Astronomical Environments?

 - **Abstract**
 The search for large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with over 100 carbon atoms is crucial to resolving the origin of unidentified infrared emission (UIE) bands. These bands are commonly observed in nebulae and the interstellar medium, yet their spectroscopic assignment has remained unknown for decades. Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), the world's most sensitive instrument operating in the decimeter-wavelength range, we conducted a search for rotational transitions of large, quasi-symmetric PAHs. Our sample included two prototypical UIE sources, NGC 7027 and TMC-1, along with a non-UIE source, IRC+10216, for comparison. A matched filter technique was employed to isolate comb-like spectral features from quasi-symmetric PAHs containing 138 to 194 carbon atoms in the FAST spectra. This method significantly enhanced detection sensitivity to these astrophysically critical molecular signatures. Although no such features were detected, we derived upper limits on the abundance of large PAHs based on simplifying assumptions. These upper limits are lower than the values predicted by theoretical models, which might tentatively suggest that large PAHs may not be the primary carriers of UIE bands. However, this conclusion should be treated as tentative, given that it rests on simplistic assumptions which have not been empirically validated.

 - **Abstract**
 The dense and gaseous environments of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can catalyze repeated mergers of stellar-mass black holes (BHs), potentially explaining the high-mass tail of binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). We present a semi-analytical population synthesis framework that captures key physical processes in AGN disks, including gas capture, migration, binary pair-up, gas hardening, and dynamical binary-single interactions. Our simulations show that AGN disks can produce hierarchical mergers, especially near migration traps, and may contribute to the high-mass, high-spin BBH population. This work opens prospects for constraining both the AGN channel and supermassive black hole growth with future gravitational-wave detections.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary black hole (BBH) mergers,, an important source of gravitational-waves(GWs), are assumed to be hosted in galaxies. The probability of a galaxy to host a BBH is related to its properties, for example stellar mass and star formation rate. These properties can be estimated from observables, such as the luminosity in certain observation bands. We refer to this description of host galaxy properties as host galaxy weighting models. However, the host galaxy weighting model for BBHs has yet to be accurately determined. Population synthesis has provided a variety of host galaxy weighting models. Here we investigate whether it is possible to distinguish different host galaxy weighting models using a data driven approach. We use the GW cosmology tool gwcosmo with a simulated IGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) fifth observing run (O5)-like observing scenario. We also construct a mock spectroscopic galaxy catalogue from MICECATv2. Our analysis compares the Bayes factors among three simple luminosity weighting models, r-band, g-band, and uniform weighting. The Bayes factors among different host galaxy weighting models show a minor preference for the true model for a ~200-detection case, and a decisive preference for the true model over the uniform model for a ~1000-detection case, which is strongly driven by a small number of well-localised events.
#### Main and interpulse interaction in PSRs J1842+0358 and J1926+0737: evidence for interpole communication

 - **Abstract**
 Our understanding of the elusive radio-pulsar emission mechanism would be deepened by determining the locality of the emission. Pulsars in which the two poles interact can potentially help solve this challenge. We here report the discovery of interaction of emission between the main and the interpulse in two pulsars -- J1842+0358 and J1926+0737, based on FAST and MeerKAT data. When emission is bright in one pulse, it is dim in the other. Even when split in just 2 groups (strong versus weak) the anti-correlated brightness can change by a factor $\gtrsim$2. Both sources furthermore show the same quasi-periodic modulation from the main and interpulse, at timescales exceeding 100 pulse periods. The longitude stationary modulation from at least one pulse suggests that it is a key signature for interpulse pulsars showing main and interpulse interaction. If the interaction happens within an isolated magnetosphere, without external influences, either communication between the opposite poles is required, or global changes drive both. This detailed study of these two sources was only made possible by improved sensitivity. The fact that both show two-pole modulation strongly suggests this is a general phenomenon in interpulse pulsars. In regular pulsars only one pole is visible, and a number of these show correlated changes between the profile and spin-down rate, that are also thought to be caused by global magnetospheric changes. Our results strengthen the case that such interactive magnetospheres are common to all pulsars.
#### Axisymmetric landslides on small planetary bodies

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to understand how landslides affect the shape and rotational motion of small rubble planetary bodies. We limit ourselves to axisymmetric global landslides, and take the primordial shape of the body to also be axisymmetric. The landslides are modeled through depth-averaging, while also incorporating the effect of the body's rotation, topographical changes due to multiple landslides, the body's non-uniform gravity field and possible surface mass shedding. The body's rotational dynamics is coupled to its shape change due to landsliding, and also includes the action of radiation torque. We utilize our model to investigate regolith motion on actual asteroids. We then study the evolution of the shape and spin state of an initially spherical rubble asteroid due to impact-induced global landsliding events over its lifetime. We find that rotational fission is suppressed by regolith redistribution to the body's equator by landsliding. Furthermore, top shapes are rapidly formed and this may explain the abundance of top-shaped asteroids in near-Earth orbits.
#### 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1): Direct Spacecraft Exploration of a Possible Relic of Planetary Formation at "Cosmic Noon"

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS (also C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), henceforth, 3I), discovered by the ATLAS Chile telescope on 2025 July 1, was rapidly revealed to be the third known interstellar object (ISO) transiting the solar system, with an incoming velocity at infinity of 57.9763 $\pm$ 0.0044 km s$^{-1}$. An examination of 3I's pre-encounter kinematics shows that it is likely to be an object from the galactic thick disk, and thus a remnant of the Galaxy's ``cosmic noon'' period of intense star formation $\sim$9 - 13 gigayears ago. This kinematic assignment of 3I to the thick disk can be tested observationally in the transit of 3I through the solar system. Unfortunately for terrestrial observers, the 3I perihelion will happen when it is on the other side of the Sun as seen from Earth, at a solar elongation of 12.80 degrees, rendering observation from Earth (or near-Earth space telescopes) hard or impossible. With a retrograde orbit inclined 175.114 degrees (only 4.886 degrees from the ecliptic plane), and a trajectory passing inside the orbit of Mars, 3I will pass relatively close to a number of already launched interplanetary spacecraft. We find a strong science case for observations in the periods of the close approaches of the Psyche spacecraft on 2025 September 4, at 0.302 AU, the martian spacecraft array on 2025 October 3, and the Juice spacecraft on 2025 November 4. In addition, the Europa Clipper, Hera and even the more distant Lucy spacecraft may pass through 3I's cometary tail in the period after its perihelion passage, potentially directly observing the conditions and composition there. Spacecraft observations could, to the extent they are possible, provide the only source of spectral and imaging data during the 3I perihelion passage.
#### Overview of complex organic molecule observations in protostellar systems

 - **Abstract**
 Complex organic molecules (COMs) have been detected abundantly at various stages of star formation, particularly in the warm protostellar phase. The progress in gas-phase measurements has been accelerated by the advent of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and in ice measurements by the James Webb Space Telescope. Particularly, the community has moved from single-source studies of COMs to statistical analyses because of these powerful instruments. In this article, I review surveys that consider COMs in the gas and ice. The two takeaways from this review include; 1. Gas-phase abundance ratios for some COMs show a small difference across many objects and the ice abundance ratios show similar or higher values to the gas, both pointing to the importance of ice chemistry in COM formation, 2. Some COM ratios show larger differences across many objects which could be due to either chemical or physical effects, thus both factors need to be considered when interpreting the data.
