 - **Abstract**
 The birth of seeds of massive black holes (BHs) and nascent galaxies at cosmic dawn takes place in dense gaseous environments, which play a crucial role in shaping their coevolution and radiation spectra. We investigate gas accretion during the assembly of massive halos with $M_{\rm h}\gtrsim 10^{10-11}~M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\simeq 4-10$, driving both rapid BH feeding and concurrent nuclear starbursts. As the BH grows to $\sim 10^{6-7}~M_\odot$ via super-Eddington accretion, the accretion power inflates a dense envelope whose effective temperature approaches the Hayashi limit at $T_{\rm eff}\simeq 5000~{\rm K}$, producing red optical emission, while a coeval young stellar population of $\sim 10^7~M_\odot$ provides blue UV emission. This early coevolving system naturally reproduces the characteristic spectral features of the so-called little red dots (LRDs), a population of broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs), including the V-shaped UV-to-optical spectra and weakness of X-ray, infrared, and radio emission. Massive stars in the nuclear starburst soon explode as supernovae, injecting energy and momentum that expel gas from the nucleus, quench gas supply to the BH envelope, and ultimately drive a transition into normal AGN phases. For individual LRDs, the optical-to-UV luminosity ratio remains nearly constant at $L_{\rm opt}/L_{\rm UV}\simeq 2-10$ from the onset of accretion bursts for $\simeq 15~{\rm Myr}$, one-third of the Salpeter time, until quenching by stellar feedback. While this ratio is sustained for the LRD population at $z\simeq 4-8$, it declines toward lower redshifts as BHs can no longer maintain red envelopes, thereby losing the LRD characteristics.

 - **Abstract**
 Early JWST observations have revealed a high-redshift universe more vibrant than predicted by canonical galaxy-formation models within $\Lambda$CDM, showing an excess of ultraviolet(UV)-bright, massive, and morphologically mature galaxies. Departures from $\Lambda$CDM prior to recombination can imprint signatures on non-linear structure formation at high redshift. In this paper, we investigate one such scenario - Early Dark Energy, originally proposed to resolve the Hubble tension - and its implications for these high-redshift challenges. We present the first large-scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of these models. Modifications to the pre-recombination expansion history accelerate early structure formation and produce UV luminosity and stellar mass functions in excellent agreement with JWST measurements, requiring essentially no additional calibrations. Predictions converge to $\Lambda$CDM at lower redshifts ($z \lesssim 3$), thereby preserving all successes of $\Lambda$CDM. This model also accelerates the emergence of stellar and gaseous disks, increasing their number densities by $\sim 0.5$ dex at $z\simeq 6$-7, primarily due to the higher abundance of massive galaxies. Taken together, these results demonstrate how early-universe physics can simultaneously reconcile multiple high-redshift challenges and the Hubble tension while retaining the core achievements of $\Lambda$CDM. This opens a pathway to constraining a broad class of beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models with forthcoming observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary discs in the Upper Scorpius star-forming region are excellent laboratories to investigate late stages of planet formation. In this work, we analyse the morphology of the dust continuum emission of 121 discs from an ALMA Band 7 survey of the Upper Scorpius region. This analysis is done in the visibility plane, to measure the flux, geometry and characterise potential structures. We compare the results with state-of-the art gas and dust evolution models that include external photoevaporation, with mild values of the $F_{\rm{UV}}$ of 1-40$G_0$. From the visibility analysis, 52 of the 121 discs are resolved (43%). From the resolved discs, 24 discs have structures and 28 remain as smooth discs at the mean resolution scale of $\sim$0.1$^{\prime \prime}$ (~14au). Our results show no significant dust disc size evolution of the surviving discs in UpperSco when compared to discs in younger star-forming regions, such as Lupus. We find a strong, steeper-than-previously-reported correlation between dust disc size and disc millimeter continuum luminosity, in agreement with drift-dominated dust evolution models. We also find positive correlations between the dust disc mass vs. stellar mass and dust disc size vs. stellar mass. The slope of the dust disc size vs. stellar mass relationship is steeper compared to younger star forming regions. Additionally, we observe no significant correlation between dust disc properties and the environmental $F_{\rm{UV}}$, consistent with models predicting that dust disc properties are primarily shaped by drift and dust traps. Our models predict that gas disc masses and sizes should be highly affected by the moderate $F_{\rm{UV}}$ values that Upper Scorpius discs experience in contrast to the dust, highlighting the need for deeper and higher-resolution gas observations of these discs exposed to mild external photoevaporation.
#### Efficiency of viscous angular momentum transport in dissipating Be binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Angular momentum transport is a fundamental process shaping the structure, evolution, and lifespans of stars and disks across a wide range of astrophysical systems. Be stars offer a valuable environment for studying viscous transport of angular momentum in massive stars, thanks to their rapid rotation, observable decretion disks, and likely absence of strong magnetic fields. This study analyzes angular momentum loss in 40 Be binary simulations spanning a range of orbital separations and companion masses, using a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code. A novel framework is introduced to define the outer disk edge based on the behavior of the azimuthal velocity, streamlining the analysis of angular momentum transport within the system. Applying this framework reveals that systems with smaller truncation radii tend to reaccrete a larger fraction of their angular momentum during dissipation, thereby inhibiting the stars ability to regulate its surface rotation. Modification of this rate may alter the star's mass-injection duty cycle or long-term evolutionary track. Finally, a subset of the simulations were post-processed using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code \texttt{HDUST}, generating synthetic observables including H$\alpha$ line profiles, V-band polarization, and UV polarization. Suggestions for observational verification of the dynamical results are demonstrated using the simulated data.
#### Early galaxy evolution: The complex interstellar medium distribution of the z~7 galaxy A1689-zD1

 - **Abstract**
 We observed the gravitationally lensed ($\mu = 9.6\pm0.19$) galaxy A1689-zD1 at $z = 7.1$ in bands 3, 6, and 8 of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. These high-resolution observations ($\approx 200$ pc) enabled us to separate the source into five components in the [CII] 158$\mu$m and [OIII] 88$mu$m emission lines within a projected distance of 2 kpc. Even though these components appear to vary strongly from one another in both their line, continuum, and optical characteristics, the assembly of components do not show ordered rotation and appear consistent with simulations of a galaxy system undergoing the process of assembly. The total dynamical mass of the galaxy ($2\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$) is an order of magnitude larger than the spectrally estimated stellar mass, suggesting a near-complete optical obscuration of the bulk of the stellar component. Comparing the line ratios as well as the line properties to other properties such as the star formation rate, we find that A1689-zD1 is consistent with the relations derived from local star-forming galaxies. Even though A1689-zD1 lies on local star formation scaling relations and has a high dust and stellar mass estimate, the kinematics suggest it is in an early assembly stage, which could lead to it becoming a disk galaxy at a later stage.

 - **Abstract**
 We study how stellar velocity dispersion within the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association (Sco-Cen) has evolved over approximately 20 million years, from its formation to the present day. Using data from the \textit{Gaia} mission along with supplementary stellar radial velocities, we identified a surprising sequence of abrupt jumps and intervening plateaus in the velocity dispersion correlating with star formation bursts. These changes in velocity dispersion coincide with the association expanding in size. We measure a present-day expansion rate of about 10--12\,pc\,Myr$^{-1}$ and observe that younger star clusters within the association exhibit higher velocities compared to older ones. This result, along with the stepwise increase in both velocity dispersion and spatial extent over time, suggests a structured and sequential star formation process rather than a random one. This phased evolution strongly suggests that stellar feedback is the primary driver of Sco-Cen's star formation history, expansion, and eventual dispersal. Our findings emphasize the value of precisely characterizing stellar populations within OB associations, particularly through the creation of detailed, high-resolution age maps.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a structural analysis of bulges in dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies. Dual AGN arise in galaxy mergers where both supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are actively accreting. The AGN are typically embedded in compact bulges, which appear as luminous nuclei in optical images. Galaxy mergers can result in bulge growth, often via star formation. The bulges can be disky (pseudobulges), classical bulges, or belong to elliptical galaxies. Using SDSS DR18 gri images and GALFIT modelling, we performed 2D decomposition for 131 dual AGN bulges (comprising 61 galaxy pairs and 3 galaxy triplets) identified in the GOTHIC survey. We derived sérsic indices, luminosities, masses, and scalelengths of the bulges. Most bulges (105/131) are classical, with sérsic indices lying between $n=2$ and $n=8$. Among these, 64% are elliptical galaxies, while the remainder are classical bulges in disc galaxies. Only $\sim$20% of the sample exhibit pseudobulges. Bulge masses span $1.5\times10^9$ to $1.4\times10^{12}\,M_\odot$, with the most massive systems being ellipticals. Galaxy type matching shows that elliptical--elliptical (E--E) and elliptical--disc (E--D) mergers dominate over disc--disc (D--D) mergers. At least one galaxy in two-thirds of the dual AGN systems is elliptical and only $\sim$30% involve two disc galaxies. Although our sample is limited, our results suggest that dual AGN preferentially occur in evolved, red, quenched systems, that typically form via major mergers. They are predominantly hosted in classical bulges or elliptical galaxies rather than star-forming disc galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how active galactic nuclei (AGN) affect their host galaxies requires determining their total radiative power across all wavelengths (i.e., bolometric luminosities). We show how AGN accretion disk spectral energy distribution (SED) templates, parameterized by supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, Eddington ratio, spin, and inclination, can be used to estimate total radiated luminosities. Bolometric luminosities are calculated by integrating the accretion disk SEDs from 1$\mu$m to 10keV over $0^\circ$--$90^\circ$ inclinations, ensuring consistent treatment of wavelength gaps, avoiding double-counting reprocessed emission, and accounting for anisotropy of visible--UV emission at different inclinations. The SED, and resulting bolometric corrections, depend strongly on SMBH mass and Eddington ratio, but only weakly on spin and inclination. Increasing SMBH mass produces cooler disks peaking at lower frequencies, whereas higher Eddington ratios (and spins) yield hotter disks peaking at higher frequencies. Larger inclinations suppress the visible--UV portion of the SED, whereas X-ray emission remains nearly isotropic. Bolometric corrections in the visible--NUV range (5100Å-3000Å) show strong dependence on SMBH mass, while X-ray bolometric corrections depend strongly on the Eddington ratio. Near the SED peak (FUV; $\sim$1450Å), parameter dependencies are weak, making this band particularly robust for estimating bolometric corrections. The X-ray band is reliable, though dependence on the Eddington ratio introduces a wide dynamic range. Because our SEDs are intrinsic and defined in the rest-frame, their application to Type 1 AGN is straightforward. For other AGN, however, corrections for obscuration by the host galaxy and torus are required in many cases.
#### A comprehensive Gaia spectroscopic study of stars in the Sco-Cen complex: star formation history and disk lifetime

 - **Abstract**
 We re-evaluate the star formation history of the nearby Sco-Cen OB Association with a comprehensive analysis of Gaia XP spectra of more than 7,800 potential members. New spectral classifications are obtained by fitting individual XP spectra with templates derived from empirical spectra of young stars. Combining these spectral classifications in this work and in the literature with archival photometry leads to estimates of V-band extinction and stellar luminosities for a total of 8,846 sources. Employing SPOTS models with spot coverages of 0.34 and 0.51 for K and M-type stars harmonizes age estimates between K/M-type and F/G-type stars, with ages older than are obtained for low-mass stars from standard evolutionary models. These older ages lead to a disk lifetime that is approximately two times longer than reported in previous literature. Our re-evaluation of the star formation history with these revised age estimates uncovers evidence of underlying substructures within the Sco-Cen complex.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar prominences (or filaments) are cooler and denser plasma suspended in the much hotter and rarefied solar corona. When viewed on the solar disc filament barbs or feet protrude laterally from filament spine. When observed at the limb of the Sun, they reach into the chromosphere or even further down. For a long time, the magnetic field orientation of barbs has remained a mystery due to the paradox that the barbs possess vertical fine structures and flows but are likely to be supported in a horizontal magnetic field. Here we present unambiguous observations of a magnetic dip in a quiescent prominence foot with an upward-curved field. That is indicated by the horizontal bidirectional outflows probably produced by magnetic reconnection between the fields of a tiny erupting filament and those in a prominence foot. The altitude at the bottom of the dip is about 30 Mm. At the edge of the prominence foot, the angle between the dip field and the local horizontal is about 4 degrees. Additionally, the curvature radius of the dip bottom is estimated to be around 73 Mm. We also conduct magnetofrictional simulation to self-consistently form a large-scale magnetic flux rope with magnetic dips resembling the spine and feet of the quiescent prominence. The observations shed light on the field structure of prominences which is crucial for the instability that accounts for the eruption of prominences and coronal mass ejections.
#### On the formation of star-forming galaxies having anomalously low-metallicity regions: the role of galaxy interaction and CGM/IGM accretion

 - **Abstract**
 Gas accretion from both the circum-galactic medium (CGM)/inter-galatic medium (IGM) and interacting companion galaxy can dilute the gas phase metallicity of a galaxy. However, their relative contribution to the chemical evolution of galaxies remains to be quantified. To this end, in this work we study a sample of 510 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) having anomalously low-metallicity (ALM) regions selected from the MaNGA data available in the Data Release 17 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. ALM regions are defined as those having gas phase metallicities that are at least $\sim 2\sigma$ lower than the emprical relation between stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_{*}$) and gas phase metallicity, i.e., the $\Sigma_{*}-Z$ relation. We find that ALM galaxies have higher star formation rates and \Hi~gas fractions than normal SFGs at fixed $M_*$. $\sim$25\% of the ALM galaxies exhibit tidal features, while the tidal fraction is only $\sim$12\% for normal SFGs, indicating that galaxy interaction is an important factor responsible for the ALM phenomenon. To explore the origin of non-tidal ALM galaxies, we compare their morphologies and environments with those of mass-matched normal SFGs. We find that non-tidal ALM galaxies tend to have more disk-dominated morphologies and reside in less-dense environment. These findings suggest that cold gas accretion from the CGM/IGM is the primary cause for the ALM phenomenon, while galaxy interaction plays a minor but non-negligible role.
#### Jet-driven explosion of an accretion-induced white-dwarf collapse via a magnetorotational dynamo

 - **Abstract**
 The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a rotating white dwarf (WD) offers a potential site of millisecond pulsars/magnetars, gamma-ray bursts, and r-process nucleosynthesis. We present three-dimensional general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations including neutrinos of magnetorotational AIC, assuming the WD is rapidly spinning with a weak magnetic field confined below its surface (likely a prerequisite for rapid rotation). Within milliseconds after core bounce, the magnetic field is exponentially amplified near the surface of the proto-neutron star (PNS). We witness the emergence of a small-scale turbulent and mean-field, large-scale MRI-driven dynamo in the neutrino-cooled centrifugally supported disk formed around the PNS, which generates bundles of large-scale toroidal field with alternating polarity. The amplified field becomes buoyant and is advected above the PNS, generating a magnetic tower that drives a mildly relativistic striped jet. The jet breaks out of the WD, clearing the way for a powerful magnetized neutron-rich wind from the disk. Although our simulation cannot follow the long-term Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling phase of the PNS, the conditions are ripe for the formation of a GRB powered by magnetar spin-down. A similar dynamo may operate in magnetorotational core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The chemical abundances of alpha-elements in Galactic Centre (GC) supergiants provide key insights into the chemical enrichment and star formation history of the Milky Way's Nuclear Star Cluster. Previous studies have reported enhanced alpha-element abundances, raising questions about the chemical evolution of this unique region. Aims: We aim to reassess the alpha-element abundances in the GC supergiant GCIRS 22 using updated spectral modelling and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) corrections to resolve discrepancies from earlier abundance analyses. Methods: High-resolution near-infrared spectra of GCIRS 22 were analysed using contemporary line lists and precise stellar parameters derived from scandium line diagnostics. We applied comprehensive NLTE corrections to accurately determine the abundances of silicon and calcium. Results: Our analysis reveals solar-scale alpha abundances ([Ca/Fe] = 0.06 $\pm$ 0.07; [Si/Fe] = $-$0.08 $\pm$ 0.20) for GCIRS 22, significantly lower than previous LTE-based findings. NLTE corrections reduce the calcium abundance by approximately 0.3,dex compared to LTE estimates, aligning our results with recent studies and highlighting the importance of accurate NLTE modelling. Conclusions: The solar-scale alpha-element abundances observed in GCIRS 22 suggest that recent star formation in the region has not been dominated by Type II supernovae, such as those expected from a recent starburst. Our findings support a scenario of episodic star formation, characterized by intermittent bursts separated by extended quiescent phases, or potentially driven by gas inflows from the inner disk, funnelled by the Galactic bar. Future comprehensive NLTE studies of additional GC stars will be essential for refining our understanding of the region's chemical evolution and star formation history.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies pose an important challenge to galaxy evolution models. While they are found to host large reservoirs of atomic hydrogen, they display low stellar and star-formation surface densities. Global star formation scaling relations characterize trends in the star formation behaviour of galaxies; when used to compare populations or classes of galaxies, deviations in the observed trends can be used to probe predicted differences in physical conditions. In this work we utilize the well-studied Star Forming Main Sequence and integrated Kennicutt-Schmidt Relations to characterize star formation in the LSB regime, and compare the observed trends to relations for a normal star-forming galaxies. Using a comprehensive cross-matched sample of 277 LSB galaxies from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog Release 2 and the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array Catalog, we gain an in-depth view of the star formation process in the LSB regime. HI-selected LSB galaxies follow very similar trends in atomic gas-to-stellar mass ratio and the star forming main sequence to their high surface brightness counterparts. However, while LSB galaxies host comparably large atomic gas reservoirs, they prove to be largely inefficient in converting this gas to stars with a median depletion time $t_{dep} \approx 18$ Gyr. These results are discussed in relation to previous studies which find that LSB galaxies host low atomic gas densities and are largely deficient in molecular gas, which suggest that the faint appearance of LSB galaxies may be the result of physical conditions on the sub-kpc scale.

 - **Abstract**
 The term PeVatron designates astrophysical objects capable of accelerating particles to PeV energies. Their nature and particle acceleration mechanisms are uncertain, but ultra-high-energy gamma rays are produced when particles accelerated by either leptonic or hadronic PeVatrons interact with the surrounding medium or radiation fields. The atmospheric air shower observatory LHAASO detected photons with energies above 100 TeV from 43 sources in the Galactic Plane, proving the existence of PeVatrons within the Milky Way. In particular, one of the detections was a 1.4 PeV photon in spatial correspondence with Cygnus OB2, providing a strong hint that young massive stellar clusters (YMSCs) can act as PeVatrons. The next-generation Cherenkov telescopes will have unprecedented energy and angular resolution. Therefore, they will be able to resolve spatially YMSCs better than LHAASO. We focused on a sample of 5 YMSCs and their environments visible from either hemisphere with the CTAO or ASTRI Mini-Array. We modeled the gamma-ray emission above 1 TeV. We devised methods for classifying YMSCs that could be detected as unidentified extended TeV sources and estimated the observational time needed to distinguish the morphology of different classes of sources. We study the morphology of the sources in our sample in order to identify the main features. We simulated observations of all sources with the instrument response function (IRF) of CTAO or ASTRI Mini-Array. We compare their emission distribution to the one of the TeV halos observed by HAWC. We parametrize their radial profiles in order to develop methodologies to classify them and to distinguish YMSCs from TeV halos based on their morphology. We expect some feature, such as the emission peak, to be key in differentiating between the two classes of objects. We then test them on a sample of sources of the first LHAASO catalog.
#### Gravitational scattering of ejecta in the Didymos system cannot explain the evolution of the binary's orbital period

 - **Abstract**
 In the first few months following the DART impact on Dimorphos, it appears that the orbital period dropped by ${\sim} 30$ s in addition to the immediate ${\sim}30 $ min drop. This effect has been attributed to ``binary hardening,'' whereby the binary's orbital period would have gradually decreased as Dimorphos continuously scattered bound ejecta out of the system and lost angular momentum. We investigated this hypothesis with the goal of constraining the conditions that would lead to a gradual decrease in the binary's orbital period. We used $N$-body simulations to study the dynamical evolution of the Didymos system under the influence of a cloud of massive test particles. We demonstrate that the gravitational scattering of ejecta is not a plausible explanation for Dimorphos's anomalous orbital period drop under any circumstances. This is a result of Dimorphos's escape speed being low compared to its orbital velocity, making it a weak scatterer. If a significant fraction of DART ejecta was launched at low speeds, as impact models and scaling laws suggest, then the binary's orbital period was likely increased as this material was accreted back onto Didymos and Dimorphos. Therefore, some additional mechanism must have overcome this effect, leading to a net orbital period decrease.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiation from massive stars is known to significantly affect the evolution of protoplanetary discs around surrounding stars by driving external photoevaporative winds. Typically most studies assume that the massive stars driving these winds are comoving with their associated clusters. However, it is also known that massive stars can be runaways, after being violently ejected from their birth environment through interactions with other massive stars. In this letter, we show that the well studied system $\sigma~{\rm Ori~AB}$ is actually a runaway system, only now passing through $\sigma~{\rm Orionis}$. There are multiple observable features that indicate this is the case, including significantly larger proper motions for $\sigma~{\rm Orionis}$ than the surrounding stars, an infrared arc of ionising gas along the predicted velocity vector, and a disparity in protoplanetary disc masses across $\sigma~{\rm Orionis}$. We finally use protoplanetary disc evolution models to explain the observed disparity in disc masses, showing that those discs downstream of $\sigma~{\rm Ori~AB}$, i.e. those yet to encounter it, have larger masses than those upstream, consistent with observations. Overall, our work highlights the importance of understanding the dynamical history of star forming regions, since the time varying UV fields provided by runway stars results in a complex history for the evolution of the protoplanetary discs.

 Kinetic inductance detectors are widely used in millimeter- and submillimeter-wave astronomy, benefiting from their fast response and relative ease of fabrication. The GroundBIRD telescope employs microwave kinetic inductance detectors at 145 and 220 GHz to observe the cosmic microwave background. As a ground-based telescope, it is subject to inherent environmental systematics, namely atmospheric emission and thermal fluctuations of the focal plane temperature. This study models resonance frequency shifts induced by each source using calibrated on-site measurements of precipitable water vapor and temperature. Comparison with observational data confirms the validity of the models and identifies atmospheric loading as the dominant contributor to frequency variation under typical observation conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 UGCA 320 is a gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxy which belongs to a nearby, relatively isolated group of dwarf galaxies. Here, we combine multi-band HST imaging data with deep long-slit SALT/RSS and integral-field VLT/MUSE spectral data to study the stellar and ionized gas components of UGCA 320. Our imaging data analysis reveals a very blue (V-I~0.1 mag), flattened radial colour profile. We detect an abundance of ionized gas in UGCA 320 powered mostly by recent star formation. The stellar disc in UGCA 320 is populated predominantly by young (~120 Myr) and metal-poor (~15-30 per cent solar metallicity) stars and it rotates in the same sense as the ionized gas disc but with higher rotation velocities, and possibly in different planes. Our analysis reveals a sharp transition in the kinematic properties of the discs at radius ~10" (~0.3 kpc) and distortions in the outer disc region. We show that these features are consistent with a recent tidal interaction most likely with its close neighbour - UGCA 319. We discuss our results in the context of interacting dwarf galaxies and also show that similar inferences can be made independently from the long-slit data analysis as with the integral-field data.
