 - **Abstract**
 The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is an extreme star formation environment, characterized by higher density, higher turbulence, stronger orbital shear, and stronger magnetic field strength than the Solar neighborhood. Whether classical theories of star formation hold within this extreme environment is still debated. In order to assess the impact of these different conditions on the interstellar medium (ISM) and on star formation, we present radiation MHD arepo simulations of a Milky Way-type galaxy. We set up a high-resolution ($M_{\rm cell}=20$ M$_\odot$) region in a ring around the Solar radius, as well as in the barred region of the Galaxy to have a coherent comparison between the CMZ and the Solar neighborhood. Although the high densities and strong levels of turbulence influence star formation and feedback, we find that a key difference in the regulation of star formation between the two environments comes from the short orbital times and the strong shear present in the CMZ. In particular, we highlight the role of the quick dynamical decoupling of stars and gas that leads to periodic re-embedding events in the early lifetimes of radiating O stars. Young stellar associations get efficiently sheared apart such that the ISM is deprived of the compounding effect of radiation and supernovae in disrupting molecular clouds. This changes dramatically the evolution of giant molecular clouds and how feedback can regulate star formation in the CMZ. Stellar feedback is no longer directly coupled to the molecular cloud from which they formed and no strong and disruptive superbubbles can develop. Instead, the feedback rather acts as a background source of turbulence.

 - **Abstract**
 Gas-phase oxygen abundance (metallicity) properties can be constrained through emission line analyses, and are of great importance to investigate galaxy evolution histories. We present an analysis of the integrated and spatially-resolved rest-frame optical emission line properties of the ionised gas in 43 star-forming galaxies at $z\sim1.5$ in the KMOS Ultra-deep Rotational Velocity Survey (KURVS). Using the [NII]$\lambda6584$/H$\alpha$ (N$_2$), ([OII]$\lambda\lambda3727,9+$[OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$)/H$\beta$ (R23), and for the first time [NII]$\lambda6584$/[OII]$\lambda\lambda3727,9$ (N$_2$O$_2$) indicators at this redshift, we measure the gas-phase metallicities and their radial gradients. On $\sim4$-kpc scales metallicity gradients measured from N$_2$O$_2$ and those measured from N$_2$ are in good agreement when considering the spatial distributions of dust in each galaxy, as parameterised by dust attenuation radial gradients. We report a nearly flat metallicity gradient distribution typically at $z\sim1.5$, with the 50th, 16th and 84th percentiles at $0.01$, $-0.03$, and $0.05$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, respectively. The findings agree well with previous observational studies and simulations at this epoch. We ascribe the observed negative metallicity gradients to a natural result from self-regulating systems, and the positive ones to potential galactic fountains and higher merger rates.

 - **Abstract**
 Estimating the auto power spectrum of cosmological tracers from line-intensity mapping (LIM) data is often limited by instrumental noise, residual foregrounds, and systematics. Cross-power spectra between multiple lines offer a robust alternative, mitigating noise bias and systematics. However, inferring the auto spectrum from cross-correlations relies on two key assumptions: that all tracers are linearly biased with respect to the matter density field, and that they are strongly mutually correlated. In this work, we introduce a new diagnostic statistic, \(\mathcal{Q}\), which serves as a data-driven null test of these assumptions. Constructed from combinations of cross-spectra between four distinct spectral lines, \(\mathcal{Q}\) identifies regimes where cross-spectrum-based auto-spectrum reconstruction is unbiased. We validate its behavior using both analytic toy models and simulations of LIM observables, including star formation lines ([CII], [NII], [CI],[OIII]) and the 21-cm signal. We explore a range of redshifts and instrumental configurations, incorporating noise from representative surveys. Our results demonstrate that the criterion \( \mathcal{Q} \approx 1 \) reliably selects the modes where cross-spectrum estimators are valid, while significant deviations are an indicator that the key assumptions have been violated. The \( \mathcal{Q} \) diagnostic thus provides a simple yet powerful data-driven consistency check for multi-tracer LIM analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 The period between z ~ 3-6, a key transformational phase in galaxy evolution preceding `cosmic noon' (z ~ 1-3), is very poorly explored in terms of feedback from AGN acting through gas outflows. In this work, we study the properties of outflows in AGN (mostly X-ray-selected) from the GOODS-S field, exploiting JWST NIRSpec IFU observations as part of the GA-NIFS GTO survey. Together with its twin sub-sample from COSMOS reported in a previous GA-NIFS work, this constitutes the largest spatially resolved sample of AGN outflows at these redshifts to date, comprising 16 targets with outflows (out of a total of 19 AGN), and probes the unexplored regime of AGN at z ~ 3-6 with bolometric luminosities ~$10^{45-46}$ erg/s. We mapped the rest-optical ionised gas emission lines at sub-kpc scales and spectrally isolated the broad wings tracing fast outflows from the gas at rest in the host galaxies. The incidence of ionised outflows in the GOODS-S + COSMOS GA-NIFS sample is high (>75\%), among the highest at any redshift. We inferred outflow velocities between ~600-2000 km/s, maximum radii of <1-4 kpc, and ionised gas mass outflow rates of ~0.1-100 $M_\odot$/yr, which in some cases can exceed the host galaxy star formation rate (SFR). We find that the outflow properties inferred for the GOODS-S + COSMOS GA-NIFS AGN sample and their relations with $L_{\rm bol}$ and SFR generally align with those observed for other spatially resolved literature samples of AGN outflows across different redshifts and AGN luminosities. Nonetheless, after accounting for any luminosity bias, our analysis suggests a cosmic evolution of the outflow properties, with higher median mass outflow rates (and possibly also mass loading factors) at higher redshifts, especially at z>3, indicating that AGN outflows were stronger in the early Universe than at later times, and thus potentially more capable of affecting their host galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The connection between dense gas cores and their infant protostars is key to understanding how stars form in molecular clouds. In this paper we investigate the properties, persistence, and protostellar content of cores that would be identified by a dendrogram analysis of 1.3 mm ALMA images. We use a time series of synthetic images produced by post-processing a simulation of star formation in a massive globally collapsing clump, with polaris to calculate dust radiative transfer and CASA to generate synthetic ALMA data. Identifying sinks in the simulation with protostars, we find that most dendrogram-identified cores do not contain any protostars, with many cores being transient features associated with clumpy flow along feeder filaments. Cores with protostars generally host <4, and protostellar mass is not strongly correlated with the mass of the parent cores due to their transience and shifting boundaries. Calculating observationally-relevant intensity-weighted average temperatures for all cores, we find that even at early times the core temperature distribution spans tens of Kelvin, and its width increases with time. The 1.3 mm peak and integrated intensity of the brightest mm core do not increase monotonically as the most massive associated protostar grows, indicating it cannot be assumed that brighter mm sources host more massive protostars. Leveraging the time domain, we test observational properties that have been proposed as potential evolutionary indicators and find that only the total 1.3 mm flux density of the region, the total 1.3 mm flux density in cores, and the number of cores show strong, statistically significant correlation with time.

 - **Abstract**
 In the past decade, there has been a significant shift in astrochemistry with a renewed focus on the role of non-thermal processes on the molecular interstellar medium, in particular energetic particles (such as cosmic ray particles and fast electrons) and X-ray radiation. This has been brought about in large part due to new observations of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in environments that would inhibit their formation, such as cold, dense gas in prestellar cores or in the highly energetic environments in galactic centers. In parallel, there has been a plethora of new laboratory investigations on the role of high-energy radiation and electrons on the chemistry of astrophysical ices, demonstrating the ability of this radiation to induce complex chemistry. In recent years, theoretical models have also begun to include newer cosmic-ray-driven processes in both the gas and ice phases. In this review, we unify aspects of the chemistry driven by X-ray radiation and energetic particles into a ``high-energy astrochemistry'', defining this term and reviewing the underlying chemical processes. We conclude by examining various laboratories where high-energy astrochemistry is at play and identify future issues to be tackled.

 - **Abstract**
 We present argon abundances from a sample of 46 star-forming galaxies at $z=2-3.5$ from the Assembly of Ultradeep Rest-Optical Observations Revealing Astrophysics (AURORA) program. Although argon is an $\alpha-$element produced by Core Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe), the latest supernova yield models suggest additional argon production and enrichment by Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), unlike other $\alpha-$elements such as oxygen. To study the relationship between argon and oxygen abundances, we construct two median-stacked composite spectra for separate $z=2.0-2.6$ and $z=2.8-3.5$ redshift bins, presenting more representative measurements than previous samples that require individual detection of faint lines. Abundance ratios were determined using an empirical calibration based on the strength of the [ArIII]$\lambda7137$ emission line relative to the [OIII]$\lambda5008$ emission line. With this calibration, we estimate argon abundances (Ar/O) of $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.10}\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\odot}$ for the $\langle z \rangle = 2.26$ bin and $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.11}\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\odot}$ for the $\langle z \rangle = 3.15$ bin, suggesting minimal SNe Ia and dominant CCSNe enrichment in this sample. Comparison of our abundance measurements of $z\sim 2-3$ AURORA galaxies with chemical evolution modeling of Milky Way stars shows consistency with the Milky Way Bulge component, suggesting a rapid star-formation timescale. However, even larger samples of actively star-forming galaxies with available argon abundances, as well as comparisons between argon abundance and other critical galaxy properties (e.g., sSFR) and models (e.g., one tuned specifically to this redshift range) are needed to draw stronger conclusions on the role of argon in galactic chemical enrichment at Cosmic Noon.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterium fractionation provides a key diagnostic of the physical and chemical evolution of prestellar and protostellar cores, where it is strongly linked to CO depletion in cold, dense gas. We present the first spatially resolved maps of deuterium fraction and CO depletion in the Barnard 5 (B5) region of the Perseus molecular cloud, covering both a starless core and the protostellar core hosting the Class 0/I source IRAS 03445+3242. Using IRAM 30~m observations of N$_2$H$^+$(1--0), N$_2$D$^+$(1--0), H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1--0), and DCO$^+$(2--1), complemented by C$^{18}$O(2--1) data, we derive column density, deuterium fraction, and CO depletion maps. We find that the deuterium fraction in both mentioned nitrogen- and carbon-bearing species increases from the protostellar to the starless core, reaching $R_D^{\rm N_2H^+}=0.43\pm0.10$ and $R_D^{\rm HCO^+}=0.09\pm0.02$ in the starless core, compared with $0.15\pm0.03$ and $0.05\pm0.01$, respectively, in the protostellar core. The CO depletion factor also rises from $4.1\pm0.1$ to $5.0\pm0.1$ across the same transition. While the embedded YSO reduces deuteration in the dense inner gas, the less dense envelope traced by HCO$^+$ is only slightly affected at our resolution. Our analysis confirms that CO freeze-out and the presence of a protostar jointly regulate deuterium chemistry in star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed a large sample of SDSS spectra of Seyfert galaxies, subdividing Seyfert 1s based on their narrow-to-broad Halpha components. Comparing their narrow-lines (NL) to Seyfert2s in line-ratio diagrams, most of the NL of strong Sy 1.0 and Sy 1.2s (with dominant broad lines) are the same as those of pure Sy2s. In contrast, only 25-30 percent of the Sy1.8 and Sy1.9 nuclei (with weak broad lines) are located in the pure Sy2 region, with the rest falling in the composite-star-forming region. We explain these Seyfert-plus-star-formation spectra with a simple model. It shows that 85 percent of NL in Sy1.9 are from HII-regions, while 88 percent of the NL in Sy 1.0 arise from the same NLR as in pure Sy2. About 6 percent of the strong and weak Sy1's have NL dominated by LINER emission, while 15 percent of intermediate Seyferts (Sy 1.5 and Sy 1.6) do. To confirm this Seyfert 1 AGN plus star formation combination, we used stellar absorption-lines to compare their stellar populations. Their Hdelta strengths show that LINERs, pure Sy2s, and also the broad-line dominated Sy1s have old stellar populations. The weak Sy 1s show stronger Hdelta absorption, indicating larger proportions of young stars. About one third of the u band light in Sy1.0 and 1.2 is blended Balmer lines and continuum from the BLR. The NL gas reddening increases as the BLR strength decreases, from Sy1.0 (0.13 mag), to Sy1.9 (0.40 mag), to Sy2s and LINERs both with 0.50 mag. Our data do not support the simplest version of Seyfert 1 and 2 unification, where both AGN classes have identical NL.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of EP250827b/SN 2025wkm, an X-ray Flash (XRF) discovered by the Einstein Probe (EP), accompanied by a broad-line Type Ic supernova (SN Ic-BL) at $z = 0.1194$. EP250827b possesses a prompt X-ray luminosity of $\sim 10^{45} \, \rm{erg \, s^{-1}}$, lasts over 1000 seconds, and has a peak energy $E_{\rm{p}} < 1.5$ keV at 90% confidence. SN 2025wkm possesses a double-peaked light curve (LC), though its bolometric luminosity plateaus after its initial peak for $\sim 20$ days, giving evidence that a central engine is injecting additional energy into the explosion. Its spectrum transitions from a blue to red continuum with clear blueshifted Fe II and Si II broad absorption features, allowing for a SN Ic-BL classification. We do not detect any transient radio emission and rule out the existence of an on-axis, energetic jet $\gtrsim 10^{50}~$erg. In the model we invoke, the collapse gives rise to a long-lived magnetar, potentially surrounded by an accretion disk. Magnetically-driven winds from the magnetar and the disk mix together, and break out with a velocity $\sim 0.35c$ from an extended circumstellar medium with radius $\sim 10^{13}$ cm, generating X-ray breakout emission through free-free processes. The disk outflows and magnetar winds power blackbody emission as they cool, producing the first peak in the SN LC. The spin-down luminosity of the magnetar in combination with the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni produces the late-time SN LC. We end by discussing the landscape of XRF-SNe within the context of EP's recent discoveries.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations suggest that Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR; SN 1572) is expanding into a cavity wall of molecular clouds (MCs), which decelerate the SNR and influence its multi-wavelength morphology. To constrain the physical properties of environmental MCs and search for heated gas, we perform a JCMT $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 observation and compare with previous $^{12}$CO $J$=2--1, $^{12}$CO $J$=1--0 and $^{13}$CO $J$=1--0 data. We present the $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 map toward Tycho and show that the $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 spatial distribution and line profiles are similar to those of the lower-$J$ CO lines. By comparing the multiple transitions of CO and the RADEX (Radiative transfer code in non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) models, we constrain the physical properties of molecular gas surrounding Tycho: the northern cloud has a molecular column density of $N({\rm H}_{2})=0.5$ -- $4.5\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, while other regions have $N({\rm H}_{2})=0.2$ -- $3.9\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$; the kinetic temperatures $T_{\rm k}$ of these clouds are in the range of 9 -- 22 K and the volume densities $n({\rm H}_{2})$ are 20 -- $700$ cm$^{-3}$. We also discuss the difficulty in finding hot molecular gas shocked by such a young SNR. We estimate that the shocked molecular layer can be as thin as 0.003 pc, corresponding to $0.2''$ at the distance of 2.5 kpc, which is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the angular resolution of current CO observations. Therefore, our molecular observations are largely insensitive to the thin shocked gas layer; instead, they detect the environmental gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Fairall 9 is among the most massive Seyfert galaxies exhibiting a strong soft X-ray excess, but it is challenging to probe soft X-ray reverberation lags (if any) due to the long intrinsic timescales expected from its large black hole mass of $\sim 2.55 \times 10^8 M_\odot$. We fit five XMM-Newton spectra of Fairall 9 using the hybrid reXcor model taking into account both hot and warm corona. The soft excess is explained by a combination of a physically motivated warm corona and the disc reflection. Then, we perform a wavelet coherence analysis of the light curves between 0.3 - 1 and 1 - 4 keV bands. The spectral fits are consistent with a rapidly spinning black hole ($a = 0.99$), a warm corona with optical depth $\sim$10 - 30, and a hot lamp-post corona located at either 5 or $20~r_{\rm g}$. This configuration supports a coexisting hot and warm corona scenario, allowing the disc to extend almost to the event horizon. Our wavelet analysis on combined observations reveals signatures of transient soft X-ray lags, confined to specific time-frequency intervals. The earlier observations exhibit more variable and transient lag behavior. In contrast, the later observations display more persistent soft X-ray lags at the frequencies of $\sim 9\times 10^{-6}$ - $2.5 \times 10^{-5}$ Hz, with amplitudes reaching $\sim$1000 s. The results indicate a progressively stable disc-corona configuration in later observations. Given the mass and geometry of Fairall 9, the observed soft lags appears plausibly consistent in both size and timescales with expectations from X-ray reverberation.

 - **Abstract**
 Millimeter/submillimeter variability is often attributed to dynamical disk-mediated accretion, yet detection is limited to low-mass protostars in nearby clouds. Recent observations have also revealed significant (sub)millimeter variability in high-mass protostars, but the confirmed cases are scarce and lack systematic monitoring. In this work, we analyzed multi-epoch Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 (1.3 mm) continuum observations of 22 massive protoclusters, with epoch separations ranging from a few hours to more than two years, while achieving a consistent angular resolution of approximately 0.3 arcsec. These data allow us to track variability of protostars across a broader mass range and in an environment markedly different from nearby clouds. Using a custom processing pipeline for data reduction, image alignment, and relative flux calibration, we achieve high-precision flux measurements and, for the first time, investigate millimeter variability in massive protoclusters based on interferometric data in a statistical manner. Applying the astrodendro algorithm, we identified 383 condensations and tracked their variations in peak intensities. Standard deviation analysis and difference maps reveal five variable sources, corresponding to a lower limit of 1.3% on the variable fraction. Among these, I13111-6228 stands out as it hosts a hypercompact H II region that exhibits a 68% increase in continuum peak intensity over one year, with an uncertainty of 2%. This supports the burst-mode accretion picture in massive star formation as a viable route for the formation of massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Young binary stars with discs provide unique laboratories to study the earliest stages of planet formation in star-forming environments. The detection of substructure in discs around Class I protostars challenges current models of disc evolution, suggesting that planets may form earlier than previously expected ($<1$ Myr). In the context of the ALMA Large Program FAUST, we present observations of the circumbinary disc (CBD) around the young binary system L1551 IRS 5. The CBD exhibits two prominent over-densities in the continuum emission at the edge of the cavity, with the Northern over-density being about 20% brighter than the Southern one. By analysing the disc morphology and kinematics of L1551 IRS 5, we delineate dynamical constraints on the binary's orbital parameters. Additionally, we present 3D hydrodynamical models of the CBD to predict both the dust and the gas surface densities. Then, we compare the resulting synthetic observations with ALMA observations of the continuum emission at 1.3 mm and the C$^{18}$O line emission. Our analysis suggests that the density enhancements observed with ALMA in L1551 IRS 5 can be caused by interactions between the binary stars and the CBD, leading to dust concentration within the disc. We conclude that the observed over-density corresponds to a location where could potentially grow under favourable conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-resolution and sensitivity ALMA observations have unveiled the carbon isotope ratios ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C) of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in a low-mass protostellar source. To understand the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH$_{3}$OH) are slightly enriched in $^{13}$C compared to the local ISM (by $\sim$ 10 $\%$), while those from C and C$^{+}$ are depleted in $^{13}$C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas ($>$ 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in $^{13}$C compared to the observations. Thus, We additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H$_{2}$O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H$_2$CO ice or \ce{C2O} ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form \ce{^13C}-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate $^{13}$C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model. We also discuss the impact of the cosmic ray ionization rate on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of COMs.

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid quenching of satellite galaxies in dense environments is often attributed to environmental processes such as ram pressure stripping. However, stripping alone cannot fully account for the removal of dense, star-forming gas in many satellites, particularly in their inner regions. Recent models and indirect observations have suggested that star formation-driven outflows may play a critical role in expelling this remaining gas, yet direct evidence for such feedback-driven quenching remains limited. Here we report the discovery of an ionized gas outflow in NGC 4064, a Virgo cluster satellite that has already lost most of its cold gas through environmental stripping. MUSE observations from the Multiphase Astrophysics to Unveil the Virgo Environment (MAUVE) survey reveal a bi-polar outflow driven by residual, centrally concentrated star formation in NGC 4064 - despite its current star formation rate being ~0.4 dex below the star-forming main sequence due to prior interaction with the cluster environment. The outflow's mass loading factor is ~2, suggesting that stellar feedback could remove the remaining gas on timescales shorter than those required for depletion by star formation alone. These results demonstrate that even modest but centrally concentrated star formation can drive efficient feedback in stripped satellites, accelerating quenching in the final stages of their evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric thermal tides arise from the diurnal contrast in stellar irradiation. They exert a significant influence on the long-term rotational evolution of rocky planets because they can accelerate the planetary spin, thereby counteracting the decelerating effect of classical gravitational tides. Consequently, equilibrium tide-locked states may emerge, as exemplified by Venus and hypothesised for Precambrian Earth. Quantifying the atmospheric thermal torque and elucidating its dependence on tidal frequency -- both in the low- and high-frequency regimes -- is therefore essential. In particular, we focus here on the resonance that affected early Earth, which is associated with a forced Lamb wave. Within the framework of linear theory, we develop a new analytical model of the atmospheric response to both gravitational an thermal tidal forcings for two representative vertical temperature profiles that bracket the atmospheres of rocky planets: (i) an isothermal profile (uniform temperature) and (ii) an isentropic profile (uniform potential temperature). Dissipative processes are incorporated via Newtonian cooling. We demonstrate that the isothermal and isentropic cases are governed by the same general closed-form solution, and we derive explicit expressions for the three-dimensional tidal fields (pressure, temperature, density and wind velocities) throughout the spherical atmospheric shell. These results constitute the foundation for two forthcoming papers, in which analytical formulae for the thermotidal torque will be presented and compared with numerical solutions obtained from General Circulation Models (GCMs).

 - **Abstract**
 Common methods for studying the kinematics and geometry of outflowing gas rely on modeling emission and absorption lines in integrated spectra using methods that are not physically motivated, including empirical quantiles or fitting multiple Gaussian or Voigt profiles. Such methods are not always consistent with the interpretation of these features and, as a result, miss key underlying physics and can even lead to inaccurate interpretations of observations. To address this problem, we present the publicly available python code OutLines, which provides astrophysical models of spectral emission and absorption line profiles produced by outflows in a variety of environments. The OutLines code accounts for differences in parameterization of the velocity field and density profile while allowing for different outflow geometries, making OutLines versatile and useful for a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena. We demonstrate the wide applicability of OutLines by using the code to model line profiles in an H II region knot, super star clusters, a starburst galaxy, and an AGN. In each of these contexts, we illustrate how OutLines can illuminate key underlying physics in ways that improve our scientific understanding and address important open questions in astronomy, including the key mechanisms in the baryon cycle, the evolution of H II regions and galaxies, and even Lyman continuum escape. OutLines will be a critical resource as massively multiplexed spectroscopic surveys like WEAVE-LOFAR and 4MOST/WAVES come online, providing the means to probe feedback kinematics with deeper, higher resolution spectroscopy for unprecedented large samples of galaxies.
#### Can accreting isolated neutron stars be detected?

 - **Abstract**
 We perform population synthesis modeling of isolated neutron stars in the Milky Way over its lifetime. Compared with previous studies, we use more detailed models of the interstellar medium and the magneto-rotational evolution of neutron stars. We demonstrate that presently, the spin-down rate at the propeller stage is the main uncertain factor that influences the number of accreting isolated neutron stars. If the propeller stage duration allows neutron stars to begin accreting matter from the interstellar medium and if the efficiency of accretion is high, then the number of accreting isolated neutron stars in eROSITA data can reach ~a few thousand. Still, uncertainties in spin-down at the propeller stage and in the accretion process can drastically decrease this number. We suggest that future observations of neutron stars in wide low-mass binaries recently discovered by Gaia can clarify these issues.
#### Pressure and Star Formation in LITTLE THINGS Dwarf Irregular Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The surface densities of star formation, Sigma_SFR, in 24 dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies from the LITTLE THINGS survey are combined with gas surface densities and midplane pressures to examine the correlations found previously for spiral galaxies. The pressure is the weight of the disk inside the gas layer, including gas, stars, and dark matter, which usually dominates disk gravity in dIrrs. We compare the results to the outer part of M33, which has similar local properties but a slightly higher metallicity, enabling the detection of CO. All the data are convolved to the HI beam, but to study the effects of resolution, the galaxies are examined first with average radial profiles, and then with maps having 1.5" pixels and 244 pc pixels. The correlations are found to be independent of resolution from 24 pc to 424 pc. The average ratio of molecular to atomic surface density is estimated to be 0.23+-0.1, from the H_2 surface density in M33 compared to the HI surface density at the same Sigma_SFR in the dIrrs. With this ratio, the average star formation rate per molecule is about the same for all the dIrrs, and a factor of 2 less than the rate in M33. The pressure in dIrrs is so low that CO is essentially a dense gas tracer, with the same surface density threshold at the low metallicities of dIrrs as HCN has in spiral galaxies. As a result, CO regions in dIrrs should be strongly self-gravitating.

 - **Abstract**
 The elemental compositions of exoplanets encode information about their formation environments and internal structures. While volatile ratios such as carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) are used to trace formation location, the rock-forming elements - magnesium (Mg), silicon (Si), and iron (Fe) - govern interior mineralogy and are commonly assumed to reflect the host star's abundances. Yet this assumption remains largely untested. Ultra-hot Jupiters, gas-giant exoplanets with dayside temperatures above 3000 K, provide rare access to refractory elements that remain gaseous. Here we present high-resolution thermal emission spectroscopy of the exoplanet WASP-189b (Teq = 3354^{+27}_{-34} K) obtained with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) on Gemini South. We detect neutral iron (Fe I), magnesium (Mg I), silicon (Si I), water (H_2O), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydroxyl (OH) at signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 4, and retrieve their elemental abundances. We show that the Mg/Si, Fe/Mg, and Si/Fe ratios are consistent with stellar values, while the refractory-to-volatile ratio is enhanced by roughly a factor of ~2. These findings demonstrate that giant-planet atmospheres can preserve stellar-like rock-forming ratios, providing an empirical validation of the stellar-proxy assumption that underpins planetary composition and formation models across exoplanet systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations have suggested that galactic outflows contain substantial amounts of dense and clumpy molecular gas, creating favourable conditions for igniting star formation. Indeed, theoretical models and hydrodynamical simulations have suggested that stars could form within galactic outflows, representing a new mode of star-formation that differs significantly from the typical star formation in star forming discs. In this paper, we examine 12 local galaxies with powerful Active Galactic Nuclei and high star-formation rate using spectroscopic data from the X-shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. We investigate the excitation mechanism and physical properties of these outflows via spatially resolved diagnostic diagrams (along with tests to rule out contribution by shocks and external photoionisation). Out of the seven galaxies with clearly detected outflows, we find robust evidence for star formation within the outflow of one galaxy (IRAS 20551-4250), with two additional galaxies showing tentative signs (IRAS 13120-5453 and F13229-2934). Therefore, our findings support previous results that star formation inside outflows can be a relatively common phenomenon among these active galaxies and may have played an important role in the formation and evolution of the spheroidal component of galaxies.
