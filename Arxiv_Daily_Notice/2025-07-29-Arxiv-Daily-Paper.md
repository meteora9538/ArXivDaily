 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the timescales of atomic gas turbulence is crucial to understanding the interplay between star formation and the interstellar medium (ISM). To investigate the timescales of turbulence low-mass galaxies ($10^{6.8}<M_\odot<10^9$), this study combines temporally resolved star formation histories (SFHs) -- derived from color-magnitude diagrams -- with kinematic data of the atomic and ionized hydrogen in a large sample of nearby, star-forming, low-mass galaxies. To best understand the timescales involved, SFHs and gas kinematics were analyzed in 400$\times$400 parsec regions to capture the local impacts of star formation. No strong correlation was found between the ionized gas velocity dispersion and the star formation activity over the past 5-500 Myr. In contrast, a consistent and significant correlation between the atomic hydrogen turbulence measures and the star formation activity t$\geq$100 Myr ago was identified. This correlation suggests the star formation activity and atomic gas are coupled on this timescale. This connection between star-formation activity $>$100 Myr ago, and the HI turbulence properties, may be related to the time scales over which turbulence decays in the ISM. Additionally, the results demonstrate a possible difference in the global and local turbulence properties of low-mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The quest to find the first stars has driven astronomers across cosmic time, from hopes to identify their signatures in their heyday at cosmic dawn to deep searches for their remnants in our local neighborhood. Such work crucially relies on robust theoretical modelling to understand when and where we expect pristine star formation to have occurred and survived. To that end, here we introduce an analytic bathtub for cosmic dawn, the abcd model, to efficiently trace the formation of the first stars from their birth through the first billion years of our universe's history, jointly following star formation out of pristine and metal-enriched gas over time. Informed by the latest theoretical developments in our understanding of star formation in molecular cooling halos, metal mixing, and early galaxies, we expand pre-existing minimal models for galaxy formation to include Population III stars and many of the processes - both internal and environmental - affecting their evolution, while remaining fast and interpretable. With this framework, we can bridge the gap between numerical simulations and previous semi-analytic models, as we self-consistently follow star formation in dark matter halos from the minihalo era through the epoch of reionization, finding that, under plausible physical conditions, pristine star formation can persist at a high level in the presence of Pop II star formation down to $z\sim 5$, but is limited to the most massive halos. We highlight areas of theoretical uncertainty in the physics underpinning Pop III star formation and demonstrate the effects of this uncertainty first on individual star formation histories and subsequently bracketing the range of global star formation levels we expect. Finally, we leverage this model to make preliminary observable predictions, generating forecasts for high-$z$ luminosity functions, transient rates, and the 21-cm global signal.
#### The Timing Evolution of the Magnetar Swift J1818.0-1607 During a Period of Reduced Activity

 - **Abstract**
 We report results from an observational campaign of the radio-loud magnetar Swift J1818.0-1607 using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at 2.0 GHz, which began in November 2021 during a period of reduced activity approximately 20 months after its March 2020 outburst. Over the 60-day duration reported here, the integrated pulse profile remained consistently stable, exhibiting a single, narrow peak with with a small precursor component and no evidence of a postcursor one. This pulse profile is in sharp contrast to the double-peaked morphology observed during an observing campaign approximately 120 days preceding ours. Along with this change in the integrated pulse profile shape, we also measure a slower spin-down rate compared to the end of that preceding campaign. Together, these differences suggest that a mode-switching event likely occurred between the end of that campaign and the start of ours. Finally, we derived a phase-connected timing solution from our data, from which we inferred a characteristic age of approximately 2500 years, about 2.5 times older than the most recent published estimate, and a surface dipole magnetic field strength of roughly 1 x 10^14 G, nearly three times weaker. These updated estimates reflect the short-term variations in the magnetar's spin-down rate, from which both its age and magnetic field strength are inferred, rather than intrinsic changes in the magnetar itself.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an overview of the MINERVA survey, a 259.8 hour (prime) and 127 hour (parallel) Cycle 4 treasury program on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). MINERVA is obtaining 8 filter NIRCam medium band imaging (F140M, F162M, F182M, F210M, F250M, F300M, F360M, F460M) and 2 filter MIRI imaging (F1280W, F1500W) in four of the five CANDELS Extragalactic fields: UDS, COSMOS, AEGIS and GOODS-N. These fields were previously observed in Cycle 1 with 7 - 9 NIRCam filters by the PRIMER, CEERS and JADES programs. MINERVA reaches a 5$\sigma$ depth of 28.1 mag in F300M and covers $\sim$ 542 arcmin$^2$, increasing the area of existing JWST medium-band coverage in at least 8 bands by $\sim$ 7$\times$. The MIRI imaging reaches a 5$\sigma$ depth of 23.9 mag in F1280W and covers $\sim$ 275 arcmin$^2$ in at least 2 MIRI filters. When combined with existing imaging, these data will provide a photometric catalog with 20-26 JWST filters (depending on field) and 26-35 filters total, including HST. This paper presents a detailed breakdown of the filter coverage, exposure times, and field layout relative to previous observations, as well as an overview of the primary science goals of the project. These include uncovering the physics of enigmatic sources hiding in current broadband catalogs, improving systematics on stellar mass functions and number densities by factors of $\gtrsim$ 3, and resolved mapping of stellar mass and star formation at 1 $< z <$ 6. When complete, MINERVA will become an integral part of the treasury deep field imaging datasets, significantly improving population studies with well-understood completeness, robust photometric redshifts, stellar masses, and sizes, and facilitating spectroscopic follow up for decades to come.

 - **Abstract**
 Crystal Eye is a space-based all-sky monitor optimized for the autonomous detection and localization of transients in the 10 keV to 30 MeV energy range, a region where extensive observations and monitoring of various astrophysical phenomena are required. By focusing on the operating environment and its impact on the observation process, we optimized the detector design and assessed its scientific potential. We explored the use of novel techniques to achieve the science goals of the experiment. We assumed the orbit of a potential future mission at approximately 550 km altitude near the equatorial region with a 20° inclination. In such an orbit, the main background contributions for this kind of detector are from different particles and radiation of cosmic origin and secondaries produced by their interaction in the Earth's atmospheric and geomagnetic environment. We studied the response of the detector in this background environment, using the Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit. We also calculated other detector performance parameters to estimate its scientific capabilities. The detector effective area and efficiency are calculated for low energy gamma-ray sources and used to estimate its sensitivity to short-duration transient and persistent sources. The calculation shows a better effective area and sensitivity by several factors compared to existing instruments of similar type. A method is also developed and discussed to estimate the online transient-localization performance of the detector, suggesting a better localization precision by about an order of magnitude than those typically reported by existing gamma-ray monitors. We present here the simulation study and results of an innovative detector design concept that can make a significant contribution in the multi-messenger era. Moreover, this study can be useful as a technical reference for similar future experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of 652 young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Carina star-forming region. The catalog was constructed by combining near-infrared Ks-band variability from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea eXtended survey and medium-resolution H-band spectroscopy from APOGEE-2, Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV). Variability analysis of 6.35 million sources identified 606 variable stars. The classification of the spectral lines by semisupervised K-means clustering of 704 stars, refined through comparison with known catalogs in literature and visual inspection of the spectra, was performed. Combined with Ks variability, the final catalog contains three groups: Emission-line YSOs, Absorption-line YSOs, and Literature/Variable-identified YSOs. Cross validation with the Gaia DR3 proper motion and distance estimates supports Carina membership for 415 sources. The statistical characterization of YSO variability demonstrated that most Carina members (78%) exhibit variability patterns. Of these, 134 stars show emissions in their spectra, which is consistent with some accretion processes. Analysis of fundamental stellar parameters from StarHorse and Gaia DR3 reveals typical distributions of YSOs, dominated by low-mass 1-4 Msun, solar-metallicity stars with temperatures between 4000 and 6000K. Only a small fraction (4%) of the sources are more massive than 4 Msun, suggesting limited ongoing massive star formation in Carina. This well-characterized catalog also offers a robust training dataset for machine learning applications aimed at predicting YSO behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide a method to calculate the evolution of an eccentric and inclined orbit under the magnetic effect. Taking the unipolar interaction as an example, we study both coplanar and inclined orbits. We calculate the Lorentz force and then the changes in orbital energy and angular momentum. Combined with the total energy dissipation we write down the evolution equations of semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination and spin. This set of equations can be used to study the orbital and spin evolution under the magnetic interaction.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most remarkable outcomes from JWST has been the exquisite UV-optical spectroscopic data for galaxies in the high-redshift Universe ($z \geq 5$), enabling the use of various nebular emission lines to infer conditions of the interstellar medium. In this work, we evaluate the reliability of these diagnostics, specifically those used to recover the star formation rate (SFR), the ionising photon production efficiency, and the gas-phase oxygen abundance. We use forward-modelled galaxy spectra from idealised toy models and the FLARES cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to assess how these diagnostic lines respond to variations in the underlying stellar populations and star-dust geometry. We find that due to the clumpy nature of FLARES galaxies, they exhibit strong internal variation in age, metallicity and dust attenuation, biasing the interpretation using these diagnostics. In FLARES, the SFRD at the bright-end of the SFR function can be underestimated by as much as $30 \%$ compared to the true values. Similarly, the true ionising photon production efficiency in FLARES remains almost constant with stellar mass, while estimates using H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$ can underestimate it by more than 0.5 dex at the massive end ($>10^{9.5}$ M$_{\odot}$), introducing an artificial declining trend. The FLARES mass-metallicity relation derived from line ratios (dust corrected) exhibits a flat trend, whereas the intrinsic mass-weighted relation shows a strong positive correlation. These findings highlight the critical importance of understanding the biases introduced due to the coupling of star-dust geometry and heterogeneous stellar population when interpreting nebular emission lines at high redshift. Hence the accurate interpretation of high-redshift galaxy spectra requires careful forward modelling that accounts for realistic star-dust geometry and population variations.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that primordial black holes (PBHs) with significant spin and bulk motion produce sharply collimated neutrino bursts from Hawking evaporation, arising from the interplay of spin-induced angular anisotropy and relativistic Doppler boosting. This effect shifts the neutrino spectrum into the multi-GeV to hundreds of GeV range, where atmospheric backgrounds drop steeply, and enhances the flux by orders of magnitude within a narrow forward cone. We compute the full lab-frame neutrino distribution and derive updated constraints on PBH number density from non-observation of such bursts in IceCube and KM3NeT. Our results identify directional high-energy neutrino bursts as a distinctive, testable signature of spinning PBHs, providing a complementary probe of the PBH dark matter hypothesis and Hawking radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing by a stellar microlens of mass $M$ forms two images separated by micro-arcseconds on the sky and has a time delay of $2\times10^{-5}(M/{\rm M_\odot})$ seconds. Although we cannot resolve such micro-images in the sky, they could be resolved in time if the source is a fast radio burst (FRB). In this work, we study the magnification ($|\mu|$) and time delay~($t_d$) distributions of micro-images led by different microlens populations. We find that, in microlensing of typical strongly lensed (macro-)images in galaxy lenses, micro-images stemmed from a population of stellar mass microlenses in the $[0.08, 1.5]\:{\rm M_\odot}$ range and a second (dark) microlens population in $[10^{-3} - 10^{-2}]\:{\rm M_\odot}$ range reside in different parts of $|\mu|-t_d$ plane. For the global minimum macro-image, due to low stellar mass density, we find that the stellar population leads to peaks in autocorrelation at ${>}10^{-6}$ seconds, whereas the secondary population leads to peaks at ${<}10^{-6}$ seconds, allowing us to differentiate different microlens populations. However, an increase in stellar density introduces new peaks at ${<}10^{-6}$ seconds, which can pollute the inference about the presence of multiple microlens populations. In addition, we also show that the number of micro-images, hence the number of peaks in the autocorrelation, is also sensitive to the underlying stellar mass function, allowing us to constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) with FRB microlesning in the future. This work is a first step towards using FRB lensing to probe the microlens population within strong lenses, and more detailed studies are required to assess the effect of various uncertainties that we only discussed qualitatively.
#### Predicting the X-ray signatures of the imminent T Coronae Borealis outburst through 3D hydrodynamic modeling

 - **Abstract**
 T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is a symbiotic recurrent nova with eruptions in 1866 and 1946. Mounting evidence suggests an imminent outburst, offering a rare opportunity to observe a nearby nova in detail. We constrain the circumbinary medium (CBM) by modeling inter-eruption radio observations and simulate the hydrodynamic evolution of the upcoming outburst to predict its X-ray signatures, focusing on the roles of the red giant companion, accretion disk, and equatorial density enhancement (EDE). We model thermal radio emission from a CBM composed of a spherical wind and a torus-like EDE to estimate its density. We then perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the nova outburst, varying explosion energy, ejecta mass, and CBM configuration. From these, we synthesize X-ray light curves and spectra as they would appear to XMM-Newton and XRISM. The CBM in T CrB is significantly less dense than in other symbiotic novae, with a mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} \approx 4 \times 10^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for a 10 km s$^{-1}$ wind. Despite the low-density EDE, the blast is collimated along the poles by the accretion disk and EDE, producing a bipolar shock. The red giant partially shields the ejecta, forming a bow shock and hot wake. X-ray evolution proceeds through three phases: an early phase (first few hours) dominated by shocked disk material; an intermediate phase ($\sim 1$ week-1 month) driven by reverse-shocked ejecta; and a late phase dominated by shocked EDE. Soft X-rays trace shocked ejecta, hard X-rays arise from shocked ambient gas, and synthetic spectra show asymmetric, blueshifted lines due to absorption by expanding ejecta. The X-ray evolution resembles that of RS Oph and V745 Sco, with a peak luminosity of $L_\mathrm{X} \approx 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$, but features a more prolonged soft X-ray phase, reflecting the lower CBM density and distinct ejecta-environment interaction.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern sky surveys produce vast amounts of observational data, making the application of classical methods for estimating galaxy properties challenging and time-consuming. This challenge can be significantly alleviated by employing automatic machine and deep learning techniques. We propose an implementation of the ULISSE algorithm aimed at determining physical parameters of galaxies, in particular star-formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses ($M_{\ast}$), using only composite-color images. ULISSE is able to rapidly and efficiently identify candidates from a single image based on photometric and morphological similarities to a given reference object with known properties. This approach leverages features extracted from the ImageNet dataset to perform similarity searches among all objects in the sample, eliminating the need for extensive neural network training. Our experiments, performed on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, demonstrate that we are able to predict the joint star formation rate and stellar mass of the target galaxies within 1 dex in 60% to 80% of cases, depending on the investigated subsample (quiescent/star-forming galaxies, early-/late-type, etc.), and within 0.5 dex if we consider these parameters separately. This is approximately twice the fraction obtained from a random guess extracted from the parent population. Additionally, we find ULISSE is more effective for galaxies with active star formation compared to elliptical galaxies with quenched star formation. Additionally, ULISSE performs more efficiently for galaxies with bright nuclei such as AGN. Our results suggest that ULISSE is a promising tool for a preliminary estimation of star-formation rates and stellar masses for galaxies based only on single images in current and future wide-field surveys (e.g., Euclid, LSST), which target millions of sources nightly.
#### Hydrodynamical modeling of SN 2025kg associated with the Fast X-ray Transient EP250108a

 - **Abstract**
 Supernovae (SNe) associated with X-Ray Flashes (XRFs) are extremely rare. Therefore, the discovery of each new object in this class offers a unique opportunity to improve our understanding about their origins and potential connection with other high-energy phenomena. SN 2025kg is one of the most recent events discovered in this category, and exhibits a double-peaked light curve, with an initial cooling phase followed by the main peak. Here, we investigate the possible mechanisms powering its bolometric light curve and expansion velocities, using numerical calculations to simulate the explosion. We found that low ejecta masses (Mej ~ 2 Msun) and moderate explosion energies (E ~ 2e51 erg) are required to reproduce the data. Our models also show that a large amount of nickel (M_Ni = 0.85 Msun) is needed to achieve the high luminosity of SN 2025kg, which makes this scenario difficult to sustain. As an alternative, we explore a model in which a millisecond magnetar serves as the primary energy source. A magnetar with a spin period of 3 ms, approximately, and a magnetic field of 28e14 G gives an adequate match to the data. To account for the early cooling phase, we assume the presence of a dense circumstellar material surrounding the progenitor, with a mass of 0.27 Msun and an extension of 500 Rsun. A comparison and modeling of a select group of SNe--SN 2006aj, SN 2020bvc and SN 2023pel--is also presented. A remarkable similarity emerges between SN 2025kg and SN 2023pel. As SN 2023pel was recently proposed to be powered by a magnetar, this further supports the magnetar scenario for SN 2025kg.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST observations have revealed an overabundance of bright galaxies at $z \geq 9$, creating apparent tensions with theoretical predictions within standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We address this challenge using a semi-empirical approach that connects dark matter halos to observed UV luminosity through physically motivated double power-law star formation efficiency (SFE) model as a function of halo mass, redshift and perform joint Bayesian analysis of luminosity functions spanning $z = 4 - 16$ using combined HST and JWST data. Through systematic model comparison using information criteria (AIC, BIC, DIC), we identify the optimal framework requiring redshift evolution only in the low-mass slope parameter $\alpha(z)$ while maintaining other SFE parameters constant. Our best-fitting model achieves excellent agreement with observations using modest, constant UV scatter $\sigma_{\rm UV} = 0.32$ dex, significantly lower than the $\gtrsim 1.3$ dex values suggested by previous studies for $z > 13$. This reduced scatter requirement is compensated by strongly evolving star formation efficiency, with $\alpha$ increasing toward higher redshifts, indicating enhanced star formation in low-mass halos during cosmic dawn. The model also successfully reproduces another important observational diagnostic such as effective galaxy bias across the full redshift range. Furthermore, model predictions are consistent up to a redshift of $z\sim 20$. Our results demonstrate that JWST's early galaxy observations can be reconciled with standard cosmology through the interplay of modest stochasticity and evolving star formation physics, without invoking extreme burstiness or exotic mechanisms.
#### Do Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies Follow the Globular Cluster-Halo Mass Relation?

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar mass-halo mass relation and the globular cluster (GC) number-halo mass relation are two scaling relations that relate fundamental properties of normal galaxies. Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs), some of which, have rich GC systems and relatively low stellar masses can not follow the mean trend of both relations simultaneously; it is thus important to understand which relationship is followed by UDGs. Using independent halo masses determined from kinematic fitting to large radii, we identify three UDGs and two UDG-like galaxies from the literature and examine which scaling relation they follow. We find that the galaxies follow the GC number-halo mass relation but deviate in a systematic way from the stellar mass-halo mass relation, which depends on their GC count. This scatter off the relation is towards higher halo masses, or equivalently lower stellar masses. The galaxies exhibiting the largest offsets may represent `failed galaxies' that have experienced quenched star formation with later assembly.

 - **Abstract**
 Gas-phase abundances provide insights into the baryon cycle, with radial gradients and 2D metallicity distributions tracking how metals build up and redistribute within galaxy disks over cosmic time. We use a catalog of 22,958 HII regions across 19 nearby spiral galaxies to examine how precisely the radial abundance gradients can be traced using only the [NII]5755 electron temperature as a proxy for `direct method' metallicities. Using 534 direct detections of the temperature sensitive [NII]5755 auroral line, we measure gradients in 15 of the galaxies. Leveraging our large catalog of individual HII regions, we stack in bins of HII region [NII]6583 luminosity and radius to recover stacked radial gradients. We find good agreement between the metallicity gradients from the stacked spectra, those gradients from individual regions and those from strong line methods. In addition, particularly in the stacked Te([NII]) measurements, some galaxies show very low (<0.05 dex) scatter in metallicities, indicative of a well-mixed ISM. We examine individual high confidence (S/N > 5) outliers and identify 13 regions across 9 galaxies with anomalously low metallicity, although this is not strongly reflected in the strong line method metallicities. By stacking arm and interarm regions, we find no systematic evidence for offsets in metallicity between these environments, suggesting enrichment within spiral arms is due to very localized processes. This work demonstrates the potential to systematically exploit the single [NII]5755 auroral line for detailed gas-phase abundance studies of galaxies. It provides strong validation of previous results, based on the strong line calibrations, of a well-mixed ISM across typical star-forming spiral galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 High-mass young stellar objects exhibit episodic accretion bursts similar to their low-mass counterparts. Understanding these outbursts is crucial for elucidating massive star formation and disk evolution around high-mass protostars. We investigate thermal instability's role in triggering accretion outbursts using a two-dimensional hydrodynamical model that fully resolves the vertical structure of the inner disk. This approach provides a more realistic depiction of axially symmetric disk dynamics and assesses observable burst signatures. We simulate the inner 10 astronomical units of a circumstellar disk around a high-mass protostar, incorporating viscous heating and radiative transport in radial and vertical directions. Unlike previous one-dimensional studies, our two-dimensional model resolves time-dependent vertical disk structure, capturing complex radial-vertical dynamics. Our simulations show thermal instability causes significant structural changes. Steep temperature gradients and vigorous convection develop at outburst onset, with gas flows differing between midplane and upper layers. Energy release produces 15-30 year outbursts with peak accretion rates of $2-3\times10^{-4}~\rm M_{\odot}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$. While observable, these bursts are insufficiently bright with rise times differing from rapid observed events. Our models lack the "reflares" seen in one-dimensional calculations. Resolving full vertical disk structure is essential for accurate thermal instability modeling. While thermal instability significantly influences episodic accretion, it appears insufficient alone to explain observed HMYSO outburst diversity. Additional mechanisms are required for comprehensive understanding.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the processes by which galaxies transition from a star-forming to a quiescent state (quenching) is paramount to our understanding of galaxy evolution. One of the key mechanisms by which this takes place is via a galaxy's interactions with a local, over-dense environment (satellite or environmental quenching). In the very local Universe, we see these processes in action, and can also observe their effects via the distribution of satellite galaxy properties. However, extending similar analyses outside of the local Universe is problematic, largely due to the difficulties in robustly defining environments with small and/or incomplete spectroscopic samples. We use new environmental metrics from the high-completeness Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) to explore the properties of satellite galaxies at intermediate redshift (0.3$<$z$<$0.5) and compare directly to the Galaxy And Mass Assembly Survey (GAMA) at 0$<$z$<$0.2. Importantly, both the galaxy properties and environmental metrics in DEVILS and GAMA are derived in an identical manner, reducing any methodology biases. We find: i) that satellite galaxies in DEVILS and GAMA show suppressed star-formation in comparison to isolated systems at the same stellar mass, by $\sim$0.5dex in log$_{10}$(SFR/M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$), ii) that this suppression is strongest in higher mass dark matter halos (up to $\sim$1dex in log$_{10}$(SFR/M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) in the most massive halos) and iii) that at fixed stellar and halo mass, this suppression increases with time - with satellite passive fractions increasing by $\sim$10-15\% over the last $\sim$5Gyr. This is consistent with previous observations and numerical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The parameter space for mass loss in Type Ia supernova progenitors is large, with different progenitor scenarios favoring different mass loss regimes. Here we focus on the impact that uniform and isotropic outflows have on the circumstellar environment of Type Ia supernova progenitors. We vary mass loss rate, wind velocity, and outflow duration, and evolve supernova remnant (SNR) models in this grid of circumstellar structures in order to compare the bulk properties of these models (ages, radii, and \feka\ centroids and luminosities) to observations. We find that roughly 50\% of young Type Ia SNRs in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud had progenitors that did not substantially modify their surroundings on $\sim$pc scales. This group includes SN Ia with a range of luminosities, and at least some likely products of double detonation explosions in sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs. The other half of our sample can be divided in two distinct classes. A small subset of SNRs ($\sim$15\%) have large radii and low \feka\ centroids and are likely expanding into large cavities excavated by fast ($\sim$1000 km/s), sustained progenitor outflows. The majority of the SNRs that are expanding into a modified medium ($\sim35\%$) show evidence for dense material, likely associated with slow ($\sim$10 km/s) progenitor outflows, possibly a byproduct of accretion processes in near-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs spawned by younger stellar populations.

 Galaxy mergers and interactions have long been suggested as a significant driver of galaxy evolution. However, the exact extent to which mergers enhance star formation and AGN activity has been challenging to establish observationally. In previous work, we visually classified a sample of galaxies with various types of faint tidal features in DECaLS images. In this paper, we cross-correlate this sample with a principal component analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey data to investigate how the presence of these features, as well as their specific nature, correlates with intense star formation and AGN activity. Averaged over all tidal classes, we find that tidal feature galaxies are 10.3$\pm$1.5 times more likely to be in a starburst phase, and 24.3$\pm$5.0 times more likely to have rapidly quenched (post-starbursts), than those in a mass-matched control sample. Examining differences between tidal classes, galaxies with \textit{arm} features are 1.4$\pm$0.2 times more likely to be starbursting than the other categories, while those with \textit{shell} features are 2.7$\pm$0.6 times more likely to be in a quiescent state. In a similar analysis, we identify which galaxies show evidence of AGN activity and find no significant difference between the fraction of those with or without tidal features. Overall, our results reinforce the notion that mergers play an important role in driving star formation and rapid quenching in galaxies, and provide some of the first empirical evidence that the strength of this effect has a dependence on the detailed nature of the interaction, as traced by the tidal feature morphology.
