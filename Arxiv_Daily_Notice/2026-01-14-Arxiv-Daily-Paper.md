#### Intermediate-mass black hole incubators. Gas accretion onto stellar black hole clusters in galactic central molecular zones
 - **Authors:** Jaroslav Haas, Pavel Kroupa, Sergij Mazurenko

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar dynamical evolution of massive star clusters formed during starburst periods leads to the segregation of $\gtrsim10^4 M_\odot$ stellar-mass black hole sub-clusters in their centres. In gas-rich environments, such as galactic central molecular zones, these black hole clusters are likely to accrete large amounts of the gas from their surroundings, which in turn affects their internal dynamics. In this Letter we estimated the corresponding accretion rate onto the black hole cluster and its radiative feedback. We assessed whether such an accretion flow can lead to the collapse of the black hole cluster into an intermediate-mass black hole. The estimates were obtained analytically, considering the astrophysical conditions and star formation history reported for the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. We find that a stellar black hole cluster with mass $\gtrsim10^4 M_\odot$ located in the twisted ring of molecular clouds with radius $\approx100$ pc that is observed in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy can accrete about the same mass in gas on a timescale of a few million years. We suggest that this is sufficient for its subsequent collapse into an intermediate-mass black hole. Based on an estimate of the dynamical friction inspiral time, we further argue that the locations of the intermediate-mass black hole candidates recently observed in the central molecular zone are compatible with their formation therein during the last starburst period reported to have occurred $\approx1$ Gyr ago.
#### MUSEQuBES: Investigating the Physical and Chemical Properties of Circumgalactic Gas Around Ly$α$ Emitters at $z \approx 3.3$

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed study of the physical properties of absorbers associated with $z\approx3.3$ \lya\ emitters (LAEs) from the MUSEQuBES survey. Using \HI\ and ionic column densities derived from Voigt profile fitting, we determine the density and metallicity of 75 absorbers associated with 59 LAEs through a custom-built Bayesian framework. The overall sample shows a median density $\log\,(n_{\rm H}/{\rm cm^{-3}})=-2.7\pm0.7$ and metallicity \met$=-1.6^{+1.2}_{-0.9}$ with $\approx15\%$ ($\approx 40\%$ including upper limits) of systems showing metallicities consistent with the IGM at these redshifts (\met$\lesssim -2.8$). Intriguingly, absorbers with $\log\, N(\rm HI)/{\rm cm^{-2}} \gtrsim 16.5$, corresponding to an overdensity of $\sim 100$ at $z=3$, exhibit a bimodal metallicity distribution with peaks at \met$=-3.8\pm 0.2$ and $-1.8\pm 0.6$. The latter are observed at large impact parameters ($\gtrsim150$~pkpc) and often exhibit low-ionization species (e.g., \SiII, \AlII). We interpret the former as pristine inflowing gas from the cosmic web, while the latter likely traces metal-enriched CGM associated with outflows from faint galaxies not detected in Ly$\alpha$ emission. We find no significant correlations between absorber metallicity or density and host galaxy properties, including redshift, impact parameter, SFR, Ly$\alpha$ luminosity, or environment. Absorbers separated by $\lesssim500$~\kms\ show $\sim$1~dex metallicity and $\sim$0.5~dex density variations, indicating physical and chemical inhomogeneity of the medium around these LAEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized neutron stars (``millisecond proto-magnetars'') formed in stellar core-collapse, neutron star mergers, and white dwarf accretion-induced collapse have long been proposed as central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and accompanying supernovae/kilonovae. However, during the first few seconds after birth, neutrino heating drives baryon-rich winds from the neutron star surface, potentially limiting the magnetization and achievable Lorentz factors of the outflow and casting doubt on whether proto-magnetars can launch ultra-relativistic jets at early times, as needed to power short-duration GRB. We present 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of neutrino-heated proto-magnetar winds that incorporate M0 neutrino transport. While the global wind properties broadly agree with previous analytic estimates calibrated to one-dimensional models, our simulations reveal essential multidimensional effects. For rapidly rotating models with spin periods P = 1 ms, centrifugal forces strongly enhance mass loss near the rotational equator, producing a dense, sub-relativistic outflow ( ~0.1c). This equatorial wind naturally confines and collimates less baryon-loaded outflows emerging from higher latitudes, leading to the formation of a structured bipolar jet with a peak magnetization up to ~ 30-100 along the pole, sufficient to reach bulk Lorentz factors ~ 100 on larger scales. The resulting angular stratification of the outflow energy into ultra-relativistic polar and sub-relativistic equatorial components is broadly consistent with the observed partition between beaming-corrected GRB energies and supernova/kilonova ejecta. Our results demonstrate that millisecond proto-magnetars can launch relativistic jets within seconds of formation and highlight their potential role in powering the diverse electromagnetic counterparts of compact-object explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 The 1-100 pc region embedding long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs) has been hitherto unexplored, as extremely high ionisation by the GRB prevents application of optical absorption spectroscopy on such distances. We show that the GRB ionising flux imprints a unique time- and spatially-dependent ionisation structure on the gas, that can be probed by X-ray absorption. Application of this model to a selected sample of 7 bright GRB X-ray afterglow spectra observed by \textit{XMM-Newton} EPIC-pn enables an independent, quantitative estimation of the density (log(n) $\sim$ 2-4) and distances (5-100 pc) of the ionized absorber directly from the GRB X-ray spectrum, thereby allowing us to locate the absorbing medium of this representative sample of long GRBs in the region of the density-size diagram populated by star-forming regions versus other gravitationally bound objects in the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Cosmic voids are underdense regions of the Universe that provide a unique environment to study galaxy evolution in relative isolation. Galaxy triplets in voids are rare systems where local interactions may strongly influence galaxy properties. Aims. We study the stellar populations, morphologies, mass assembly histories, and dynamical properties of six galaxies belonging to two void triplets from the Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY): CAVITY5273X and VGS31. Methods. We used integral-field unit spectroscopy and performed full spectral fitting with the FADO code, which models stellar and nebular emission simultaneously. Spatially resolved maps of stellar age, metallicity, and star formation rate were reconstructed using the integrated nested Laplace approximation. Morphological properties were derived using morfometryka, emission-line diagnostics were applied, and mass assembly functions were computed. Stellar masses and metallicities were compared to the mass-metallicity relation for void galaxies. Results. The two triplets show different evolutionary behaviours. CAVITY52731 is a massive quenched galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus, while its companions and all galaxies in VGS31 are dominated by young stellar populations and recent star formation. Five galaxies experienced rapid stellar mass growth in the last 2 Gyr. Disturbed morphologies, including asymmetries and tidal features, indicate ongoing interactions. Galaxies in CAVITY5273X follow the expected void mass-metallicity relation, while VGS31 members show significant deviations. Conclusions. Our results show that local interactions can drive significant galaxy evolution even in the most underdense cosmic environments.
#### Modeling Cosmogenic 10Be During the Heliosphere's Encounter with an Interstellar Cold Cloud

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.07983

 - **Abstract**
 Geologic records of cosmogenic 10Be are sensitive to changes in the radiation environment with time. Recent works suggest there are periods when the Sun encountered massive cold clouds which compressed the heliosphere to within Earth's orbit. This would expose Earth to increased galactic cosmic rays and MeV-energy particles of heliospheric origin. We model 10Be production in Earth's atmosphere during possible cold cloud encounters, and estimate their detectability in marine records of variable temporal resolution. We find that an AU-scale cold cloud encounter can be detected using ocean sediment measurements of 10Be if Earth spends time inside the compressed heliosphere. For typical relative speeds between the Sun and local interstellar clouds, this translates to a crossing time of ~100 years. A cloud must have an extension on the scale of parsecs to tens-of-parsecs (crossing time 0.1-1 Myr) to be detectable through 10Be measurements in iron-manganese crusts.
#### Investigating quenching in Recently Quenched Elliptical galaxies with HI studies

 - **Abstract**
 Recently Quenched Elliptical galaxies (RQEs) represent a critical phase in the transition from star-forming to quiescent galaxies. However, the mechanisms driving their quenching remain elusive. We conduct a multi-wavelength analysis of 155 RQEs, along with their precursors (preRQEs) and descendants (postRQEs), focusing on their neutral hydrogen (HI) content and star formation properties. Contrary to conventional quenching models emphasizing gas depletion, RQEs retain substantial HI reservoirs ($f_{\text{gas}} \geq 17\%$), suggesting that quenching is not primarily driven by gas exhaustion. We identify a critical halo mass threshold at $\log M_{\text{halo}} = 12.1 M_{\odot}$, delineating different evolutionary pathways for RQEs. This threshold aligns with the transition from cold-mode to hot-mode gas accretion in theoretical models. RQEs in lower-mass halos ($\log M_{\text{halo}} < 12.1 M_{\odot}$) likely experience rapid quenching, possibly initiated by major mergers, followed by brief AGN activity and sustained LINER emission. We propose two evolutionary pathways: (a) rapid quenching via major mergers followed by AGN/LINER activity and passive evolution, and (b) rapid quenching followed by rejuvenation through minor mergers before evolving into more massive, long-term quenched ellipticals. These results challenge the conventional understanding of galaxy quenching, especially in low-density environments where RQEs typically reside. Our findings suggest that while RQEs may follow a rapid quenching pathway, their evolution is influenced by interactions between gas accretion modes, feedback mechanisms, and environmental factors. Future observations with advanced radio interferometers like SKA will be crucial for elucidating the quenching mechanisms in RQEs and their role in galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae, type II supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are important sites of stellar nucleosynthesis, but they differ greatly in their rates, their location within a galaxy, and the mean thermal energy and abundance distribution of their ejecta. In earlier papers in this series we have shown that a significant fraction of metals newly synthesized by type II supernovae are promptly lost to galactic winds -- i.e., galactic winds are metal loaded. Here we investigate whether the elements returned by type Ia supernovae and AGB stars are similarly metal loaded, or whether metal loading varies significantly with nucleosynthetic site. We use a series of high-resolution ``tall box'' simulations of the interstellar medium with the \quokka~GPU-accelerated code, within which we systematically vary the galaxy gas surface density, metallicity, and the scale heights and relative rates of the different nucleosynthetic sources. We show that the metal loadings of galactic winds differ substantially between metals produced by different sources, with typical variations at the level of $\approx 0.3$ dex, a phenomenon we term differential metal loading. Which set of metals suffers preferential loss from this phenomenon varies depending on the galactic environment, and is not easily predictable \textit{a priori}. Our findings call into question the the interpretation of diagnostics of galaxy formation, for example star formation timescales and initial mass functions, based on abundance diagnostics, since the abundance variations upon which these techniques rely are often at levels comparable to those we show can be induced by differential metal loading.

 - **Abstract**
 On the framework of relativistic force-free magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, we explore the fundamental properties of strong and weak turbulent cascades using high-resolution numerical simulations in the presence of a uniform background magnetic field. We find that (1) power spectra and scale-dependent anisotropies both for the strong and weak turbulence resemble those observed in the non-relativistic MHD turbulence; (2) intermittency of magnetic fields in strong turbulence is stronger than that in the weak one; (3) generated Alfvén modes show similar energy spectra and scale-dependent anisotropies to those of non-relativistic case; (4) generated fast modes present a power spectrum similar to that of Alfvén modes, with a strong (for strong turbulence) or weak (for weak turbulence) scale-dependent anisotropy, which are significantly different from non-relativistic turbulence; and (5) applications of our numerical results to neutron star magnetospheres show that the strong (or moderately weak) turbulent cascade can explain the X-ray radiation of the Vela pulsar. Our study is of great significance for understanding energy transfer, magnetic field evolution, and particle acceleration mechanisms in extreme astrophysical environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We compute the cosmic stellar, dust and neutral gas mass history at $0<z\lesssim3$ using ProSpect spectral energy distribution modelling of $\approx 800 \, 000$ galaxies in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS). The cosmic dust mass history broadly follows the shape of the cosmic star formation history; though, the decline is slower, suggestive of a slowing rate of dust growth and destruction as the star formation declines past its peak at $z\approx 2$. Neutral gas masses were estimated by scaling the dust masses by the metallicity-dependent dust-to-gas ratio. The neutral gas mass density as traced by the dust is an average of $\approx 0.6$ dex lower than that measured from $21$cm experiments, most likely due to differences in the spatial scales inhabited by dust and HI. Folding in measurements of the supermassive black hole mass density obtained previously with similar data and methods, we present a self-consistent census of the baryons confined to galaxies. Stars, neutral gas, SMBHs and dust contained within the optical radii of galaxies account for $\approx 5$ per cent of the baryons. Most of the remaining $\approx 95$ per cent of baryons must be ionised and dispersed throughout the interstellar, circumgalactic and intergalactic media within, around and between galaxies.
#### Evaluating the effectiveness of radio frequency interference removal algorithms for single pulse searches

 - **Abstract**
 Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), the presence of artificial and/or terrestrial signals in astronomical data, poses a great challenge to the search for pulsars and radio transients, such as Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), by obscuring or distorting the signal of interest and resulting in large numbers of erroneous detections. RFI mitigation algorithms aim to remove this interference and improve the chance of detection of transients, but with the growing number of techniques, selecting the most appropriate method for a given survey can be problematic. The choice of method is particularly important in real-time searches planned for next-generation telescopes such as those of the SKAO, where there is no possibility to reprocess the data. In this paper, we explore the algorithm selection problem by injecting pulses into data which simulates several RFI environments. A set of these files is then cleaned using RFI mitigation algorithms and run through a single pulse search pipeline to analyse the recovery of the injected pulses. We examine the recovery of the injected single pulses with an emphasis on a number of cases spanning a range of pulse brightness, width and dispersion measure. The efficacy and side effects of a few popular RFI excision methods, namely IQRM, SKF, and ZDMF are evaluated.

 - **Abstract**
 Our Local Group, dominated in mass by the Milky Way (MW) and M31, provides a unique laboratory for testing $\Lambda$CDM cosmology on small scales owing to its proximity. However, its connection to the surrounding large-scale environment, which is essential for interpreting its properties, is inadequately understood. In this work, we explore the connection between Local Group analogues (LGAs) and their surrounding large-scale environments using the ABACUSSUMMIT simulation suite, highlighting the key role of the coupling energy of the MW-M31 orbit, $E_{\rm coupling}$. We find that LGAs with high $E_{\rm coupling}$ preferentially reside in denser regions, whereas those with low $E_{\rm coupling}$ tend to occupy low-density environments. Furthermore, LGAs with low $E_{\rm coupling}$ exhibit strong alignment with cosmic filaments, manifested as a pronounced polar anisotropy in the distribution of tracer haloes. By contrast, LGAs with high $E_{\rm coupling}$ show a weaker polar anisotropy but an enhanced azimuthal anisotropy, with large-scale tracer haloes preferentially lying in the plane spanned by the halo pair and the orbital spin vector. Within this framework, our Local Group is characterised by typical $E_{\rm coupling}$ residing in a relatively under-dense environment, yet it remains consistent with the 95\% range of analogue systems identified in the simulation.
#### Thermal-timescale accretion does not always yield critical rotation in mass gainers

 - **Abstract**
 Binary evolution plays a central role in producing rapidly rotating stars. Previous studies have shown that mass gainers in binaries can reach critical rotation after accreting only modest amounts of material, particularly during thermal-timescale Case B mass transfer, where tidal spin-down is ineffective due to wide orbits. However, such rapid accretion often drives the mass gainer out of thermal equilibrium, and its subsequent spin evolution during thermal relaxation has not been analysed in depth. In this study, we construct a suite of accreting detailed single-star models with different accretion prescriptions, which inflate and spin up to critical rotation during the accretion. After the accretion has ended, the models relax thermally and deflate. We find that the ratio of surface to critical angular velocity decreases to subcritical values during thermal contraction, with the magnitude of this decrease correlating with the degree of thermal disequilibrium at the end of accretion. This reduction in fractional critical rotation is even stronger when internal angular momentum transport is inefficient. Detailed binary models show the same trend, indicating that the results from our toy single-star models also apply to real binary evolution. Our results highlight that binary mass transfer does not always produce critically rotating stars, but instead may yield a wide range of spin rates depending on the mass transfer and accretion history. Our findings offer new insights into the rotational properties of mass gainers in binaries, stellar merger products, and newly formed massive stars following accretion.
#### Substellar population of the young massive cluster RCW 36 in Vela

 - **Abstract**
 The initial mass function (IMF) is a cornerstone of star formation studies, yet its universality remains debated. We investigate the IMF in the young massive cluster RCW 36, located in the Vela Molecular Ridge and comparable to the Orion Nebula Cluster in stellar density. Our goal is to build the most complete census of RCW 36 and derive its first IMF and star-to-brown-dwarf (BD) ratio. We combine new GLAO observations from HAWK-I/VLT with archival data (2MASS, SOFI/NTT) and Gaia DR3 kinematics. Photometric accuracy and source extraction were improved using \textsc{DeNeb}, a deep-learning algorithm that removes complex nebular emission. Membership probabilities were assigned via color-magnitude diagram comparisons with a control field, and stellar masses were estimated using model isochrones. We find a revised distance of $954\pm40\,$pc and determine the IMF down to $\sim0.03\,M_{\odot}$, described by a broken power law ($dN/dM\propto M^{-\alpha}$) with $\alpha=1.62\pm0.03$ for $0.20$-$20\,M_{\odot}$ and $\alpha=0.46\pm0.14$ for $0.03$-$0.20\,M_{\odot}$. The star-BD ratio is $2$-$5$, consistent with other Galactic clusters. Lastly, through a study of the differences in the IMF within and outside $0.2\,$pc and the cumulative mass distributions for low-mass and intermediate to high-mass sources, we also detected signs of possible mass segregation within RCW 36, which should be primordial. RCW 36 shares many characteristics with other young massive clusters, such as a shallower than Salpeter high-mass slope and the possibility of mass segregation. The flatter lower-mass regime of the IMF is similar to most Galactic clusters. The star-BD ratio is also in line with the observed values in other clusters, independent of their inherent properties.
#### On the Interstellar Extinction Curve toward HD 93222, A Sightline with an Exceedingly Narrow 2175 Angstrom Extinction Bump

 - **Abstract**
 The 2175 Angstrom extinction bump, the most prominent spectral feature superimposed on the interstellar extinction curve, is widely seen in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way and external galaxies, both near and far. While its central wavelength is remarkably stable and independent with environment, its width shows considerable variation and environmental dependence. Here we examine the extinction curve for the line of sight toward HD 93222, a young star located in the Carina nebula. It is found that the 2175 Angstrom bump is extremely sharp, which is among the narrowest ever found in the Milky Way and external galaxies. We model the derived extinction curve and find that, to explain the extinction characteristics of HD 93222, in addition to the conventional silicate and graphite dust mixture, an additional population of nano-sized graphitic grains is required.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new results from the MUSE-ALMA Haloes survey, covering 79 galaxies associated with strong HI absorption at redshift about 0.5. Our ALMA Cycle 10 observations add 39 systems to the initial 21, bringing the total to 60 galaxies. CO emission is detected in 9 new galaxies, and in 12 of 60 total, doubling the number of CO-emitting HI-selected galaxies and probing 1.2 dex deeper in molecular gas mass than previous studies. These galaxies span a wide range of stellar masses and metallicities. By comparing CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) properties with star formation rates and gas-phase metallicities from VLT/MUSE and HST, we find a dual behaviour in star formation efficiency: low-mass systems follow main-sequence scaling relations, while high-mass systems show suppressed star formation. This diversity indicates that HI absorbers trace both evolved and younger galaxies, providing a key step toward completing the baryon census at redshift about 0.5.
#### Stellar masses of optically dark galaxies: uncertainty introduced by the attenuation law and star-formation histories

 - **Abstract**
 JWST observations have suggested that some high-redshift galaxies may be ultra-massive, thereby challenging standard models of early galaxy formation and cosmology. We analyse the stellar masses using different modelling assumptions and with new data of three galaxies (S1, S2 and S3), whose NIRCam/grism redshifts were consistent with $z>5$. These three optically dark galaxies have previously been reported to host exceptionally high stellar masses and star-formation rates, implying extremely high star-formation efficiencies. Recent NIRSpec/IFU observations for S1 indicate a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\rm spec}=3.2461^{+0.0001}_{-0.0002}$, which is lower than previously reported. Using the Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling tool \texttt{Prospector}, we investigate the impact of key model assumptions on stellar mass estimates, such as the choice of star-formation history (SFH) priors (constant versus rising SFH base for the non-parametric prior), the dust attenuation law, and the treatment of emission line fluxes. Our analysis yields revised stellar masses of $\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \approx 10.36^{+0.47}_{-0.32}, 10.95^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ and $10.31^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$ for S1, S2, and S3, respectively. We find that adopting a rising SFH base prior results in lower inferred stellar masses compared to a constant SFH base prior. We identify a significant degeneracy between the dust attenuation curve slope, the amount of dust attenuation, and stellar mass. Our results highlight various systematics in SED modelling due to SFH priors and dust attenuation that can influence stellar mass estimates of heavily dust obscured sources. Nevertheless, even with these revised stellar mass estimates, two of the three galaxies remain among the most massive and actively star-forming systems at their respective redshifts, implying high star-formation efficiencies.

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic jets launched in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are widely accepted as the engines powering most of the population of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Understanding their structure and dynamics-particularly during and after breakout from the merger ejecta-is crucial for interpreting GRB afterglows, especially for off-axis observers. Traditional models often assume simple angular or radial jet profiles, potentially missing key features emerging for jets piercing through realistic environments. This work aims to investigate the formation and evolution of the jet structure as it propagates through a non-homogeneous, anisotropic BNS merger environment. We focus on how the interaction with the ambient medium shapes the jet's angular and velocity distributions and assess the impact of this realistic structure on the resulting afterglow light curves. We perform a series of 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jets launched in post-merger environments, exploring different injection conditions. Simulations are evolved to late times, approaching the ballistic regime, where further dynamical evolution becomes negligible. From the resulting outflows, we extract energy and velocity profiles and compute multi-wavelength afterglow light curves using a semi-analytic model that includes radial stratification and the full 3D jet geometry. More energetic or earlier-launched jets drill more efficiently through the ejecta, but all develop asymmetries that leave clear imprints in the off-axis afterglow light curves. All models exhibit a complex multi-shock breakout structure responsible for an early, dimmer peak in the afterglow. Despite structural differences, all simulated jets are consistent with the observational data of the multi-messenger BNS merger event GW170817.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio mini-halos are perplexing features, typically hosted by X-ray cool-core galaxy clusters. Understanding the connection between thermal X-ray and non-thermal radio emission is key to uncovering their origin. Here, we present a multiwavelength study of the cool-core cluster RXCJ1558.3-1410 using archival Chandra X-ray and wideband uGMRT radio data (Bands 3, 4 and 5). Our improved analysis confirms a previously known X-ray cavity at $\sim$36 kpc south-east of the cluster centre and we report a new cavity at $\sim$42 kpc to the north-west. These cavities suggest that the AGN provides mechanical power of $\sim$$6.0 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, sufficient to offset radiative cooling in the ICM. We also detect a sharp surface brightness edge at $\sim$72 kpc south-east of the centre, characterised by a temperature jump and pressure continuity, consistent with a cold front, likely caused by gas sloshing from a minor merger. Our uGMRT images reveals an interesting diffuse emission surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), with its edge spatially coinciding with the sloshing cold front and roughly with the cooling radius. Furthermore, a low star formation rate and uniform metal abundance up to the sloshing edge are consistent with the earlier findings of suppression of star formation and metallicity homogenisation by mixing core gas through sloshing. Finally, the spatial correlation between the mini-halo and the observed X-ray features indicates that ICM sloshing, rather than AGN feedback, plays a dominant role in powering the proposed radio mini-halo emission.

 - **Abstract**
 To reproduce observed galaxy properties, cosmological simulations require that massive galaxies experience feedback from active galactic nuclei, which regulates star formation within those galaxies. However, the energetics and timescales of these feedback processes are poorly constrained. We combine optical, infrared, sub-millimeter and radio observations of the active galaxy VV 340a, hosting a low-power jet launched from a supermassive black hole at its center. We find that the jet undergoes precession, with a period of (8.2 $\pm~$5.5) $\times~$10$^5$ years, and drives an outflow of gas at a rate of 19.4 $\pm~$7.9 solar masses per year. The jet shocks the gas, producing highly ionized plasma extending several kiloparsecs from the nucleus. The outflow ejects sufficient gas from the galaxy to influence its star formation rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars are the key engines of the Universe. However, their evolution and thus their ionizing feedback are still not fully understood. One of the largest gaps in current stellar evolution calculations is the lack of a model for the mass ejections that occur when the stars reach the Eddington limit, such as during an Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) phase. We aim to remedy this situation by providing a physically motivated and empirically calibrated method applicable in any 1D stellar evolution code to approximate the effect of such mass loss on stellar evolution. We employ the 1D stellar evolution code MESA, in which we implement a new mass-loss prescription that is acting when stellar models inflate too much when reaching the Eddington limit. Synthetic massive-star stellar populations using calculated grids of single-star models with this mass loss prescription are compared with the observed populations in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. In combination with already computed grids of binary evolution models, we investigate the impact of binarity on our predictions. Our single-star models reproduce key features of the observed stellar populations, namely (i) the absence of stars located beyond the Humphreys-Davidson limit, (ii) an upper limit of RSG luminosities, (iii) the faintest observed single WR stars, (iv) the absolute number of O-stars, WRs, and RSGs, (v) WO stars in low metallicity environments, and (vi) the positions of LBV stars in the HRD. Our binary population explains at the same time the 70% binary fraction of O-stars and the 40% binary fraction of WR stars. However, our synthetic population also has caveats, such as an overproduction of bright H-free WN stars. Our results show that the effect of Eddington-limit induced mass ejections on the structure and evolution of massive stars can remove tension between predicted and observed massive star populations.
