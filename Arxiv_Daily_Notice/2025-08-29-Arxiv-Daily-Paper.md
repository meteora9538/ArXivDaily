 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive compilation of short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows in the X-ray, optical, and radio bands, comprising 150 events discovered primarily by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory over 2005-2023. We pair these observations with uniformly modeled host galaxies to understand how broadband afterglow luminosities are influenced by their environmental properties. We compare the X-ray and optical afterglow luminosities at 3 hr with projected physical and host-normalized galactocentric offsets, host stellar mass, star-formation rate (SFR), specific SFR, and stellar population age. In the radio band, we explore how these environmental properties may influence afterglow detectability. We find statistical support that X-ray afterglows are brighter in galaxies with younger ages, lower masses, and higher active star formation - trends that also scale with ISM density. While we also visualize these differences for optical afterglows, the only statistically significant trend is that they are brighter in hosts with higher SFR. We further find that X-ray (radio) afterglows are more luminous (more likely to be detected) at low projected offsets. Overall, this indicates that X-ray afterglow luminosity is the most predictable indicator of host environment among the three bands. We find the afterglow luminosities of three possible merger-driven long GRBs to be unremarkable compared to the traditional short GRB population, strengthening the case that these events arise from mergers. Finally we find that the estimated on-axis afterglow luminosity of GW170817 is in the faintest ~30%, aligning with its quiescent, old and massive host environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs) are luminous, recurring X-ray outbursts from galactic nuclei, with timescales of hours to days. While their origin remains uncertain, leading models invoke accretion disk instabilities or the interaction of a massive black hole (MBH) with a lower-mass secondary in an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI). EMRI scenarios offer a robust framework for interpreting QPEs by characterizing observational signatures associated with the secondary's orbital dynamics. This, in turn, enables extraction of the MBH/EMRI physical properties and provides a means to test the EMRI scenario, distinguishing models and addressing the question: what can QPE timings teach us about massive black holes and EMRIs? In this study, we employ analytic expressions for Kerr geodesics to efficiently resolve the trajectory of the secondary object and perform GPU-accelerated Bayesian inference to assess the information content of QPE timings. Using our inference framework, referred to as QPE-FIT (Fast Inference with Timing), we explore QPE timing constraints on astrophysical parameters, such as EMRI orbital parameters and MBH mass/spin. We find that mild-eccentricity EMRIs ($e\sim0.1-0.3$) can constrain MBH mass and EMRI semimajor axis/eccentricity to the 10% level within tens of orbital periods, while MBH spin is unconstrained for the explored semimajor axes $\geq 100R_g$ and monitoring baselines $\mathcal{O}(10-100\rm)$ orbits. Introducing a misaligned precessing disk generally degrades inference of EMRI orbital parameters, but can constrain disk precession properties within 10-50%. This work both highlights the prospect of QPE observations as dynamical probes of galactic nuclei and outlines the challenge of doing so in the multimodal parameter space of EMRI-disk collisions.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars and planets form within cold, dark molecular clouds. In these dense regions, where starlight cannot penetrate, cosmic rays (CRs) are the dominant source of ionization -- driving interstellar chemistry(Dalgarno (2006, PNAS, 103, 12269)), setting the gas temperature(Goldsmith et al. (1969, ApJ, 158, 173)), and enabling coupling to magnetic fields(McKee & Ostriker (2007, ARA&A, 45, 565; arXiv:0707.3514)). Together, these effects regulate the collapse of clouds and the onset of star formation. Despite this importance, the cosmic-ray ionization rate, $\zeta$, has never been measured directly. Instead, this fundamental parameter has been loosely inferred from indirect chemical tracers and uncertain assumptions, leading to published values that span nearly two orders of magnitude and limiting our understanding of star formation physics. Here, we report the first direct detection of CR-excited vibrational H$_2$ emission, using \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) observations of the starless core Barnard 68 (B68). The observed emission pattern matches theoretical predictions for CR excitation precisely, confirming a decades-old theoretical proposal long considered observationally inaccessible. This result enables direct measurement of $\zeta$, effectively turning molecular clouds into natural, light-year-sized, cosmic-ray detectors. It opens a transformative observational window into the origin, propagation, and role of cosmic rays in star formation and galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effects of ram-pressure stripping on four galaxies within the massive, strong-lensing cluster MACS-J0138.0-2155 ($z=0.336$). Of these, three are classified as jellyfish galaxies, with significant elongated tails. Two of these jellyfish galaxies, J1 and J2, are in a late-stage of stripping and show post-starburst features within their disk regions with star formation only in the tails. Using VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopic data, we spatially resolve the stellar and gas kinematics to examine extraplanar gas associated with ram-pressure stripping. We complement this analysis with optical and near-infrared imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope to visualize the galactic structure of each member. The jellyfish galaxies are all blue-shifted with respect to the cluster and show velocity gradients of a few hundred $\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$ across their tails. From the resolved gas kinematics, we derive H$\alpha$-based star formation rates; these are generally low reaching a maximum of approximately 0.49 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}kpc^{-2}}$ in galaxy J3. We also report the kinematics for galaxy J4, which lies in the foreground of the cluster but close in projection to one of the lensed arcs.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze eight spectroscopically confirmed Little Red Dots (LRDs) at redshifts z = 5.1-8.7 with JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI data. The LRDs have red NIRCam colors, F150W-F444W > 1, but flat NIRCam-MIRI colors, -0.5 < F444W - F770W < 0.5, suggesting weak warm/hot dust components. The LRDs have -1.0 < F1000W - F1500W < 1.1, suggestive of non-uniform rest near-IR properties within the sample. We model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the LRDs using the CIGALE and Prospector codes to assess how the differing templates impact the interpretation for LRDs for cases of: (1) models with star-forming stellar populations only; (2) active galactic nuclei (AGN) dominated models; and (3) composite AGN and star-forming models. Using the Bayesian information criterion, we find that six of the eight LRDs favor AGN models compared to star-forming models, though no model can fully reproduce all of the observed properties. Two LRDs with pronounced Balmer-breaks and broad H$_\alpha$ have SEDs that can be reproduced with hot, dense-gas (log T/K=5-5.7, log n/cm$^{-3}$ = 9-11) models with low dust attenuation (A(V)~ 0.5mag). However, these models require an additional thermal component (800-1400K) to account for the MIRI data, and fail to reproduce the rest-UV and narrow [OIII] emission. The total bolometric emission from the dense-gas models, and possibly CIGALE AGN models, appear consistent with literature constraints in the far-IR and radio, and require log L$_{bol}$/L$_\odot$ <12. These results suggest that our LRDs cannot be modeled entirely with standard templates, but instead require a novel treatment of gas conditions, AGN and star-formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) exhibit excess mid-infrared H$_2$ emission compared to star-forming galaxies, likely driven by outflows and shocks inferred from integrated spectra. We present optical IFU observations of the central 2\,kpc of the AGN host CGCG 012-070, selected for its pronounced H$_2$ emission excess, to map stellar and gas kinematics. The stellar velocity field is well described by a rotating disc with a line of nodes at $103^\circ \pm 4^\circ$, with the northwest side approaching and the southeast side receding. Gas kinematics, traced by strong emission lines, show two components: a narrow one ($\sigma \lesssim 200\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) in the disc plane following stellar motions, and a broad ($\sigma \gtrsim 300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) associated with outflows within the inner $\sim$1\,kpc. Disc gas emission is mainly driven by AGN photoionization, while the outflow also includes shock-heated gas, as indicated by flux ratio diagnostics. The outflows are radiatively driven, with a mass-outflow rate of $(0.067 \pm 0.026)\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ and a kinetic coupling efficiency of 0.07%, potentially redistributing gas and contributing to maintenance-mode feedback in CGCG 012-070. Our results provide further evidence that the warm H$_2$ emission excess in nearby AGN is associated with shocks produced by outflows. Observations of other gas phases, such as cold molecular gas, are necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of the outflows on the host galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminosities of pre-main sequence stars evolve during the protoplanetary disc lifetime. This has a significant impact on the heating of their surrounding protoplanetary disks, the natal environments of planets. Moreover, stars of different masses evolve differently. However, this is rarely accounted for in planet formation models. We carry out pebble-driven core accretion planet formation modelling with focus on the impact of pre-main sequence stellar luminosity evolution on giant planet formation around host stars in the range of $1{-}2.4\ \rm M_{\odot}$. We find that giant planet formation is sensitive to the evolution of stellar luminosity, specifically the locations and times at which giant planet formation can occur depend on it. High stellar luminosity causes an increase in the scale height of the gas and pebbles, which may decrease the efficiency of pebble accretion, making it more challenging to form giant planets. This has important consequences for the composition of these giant planets, stressing the need to incorporate such aspects into planet formation models.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances in young G-, K-, and M-type stars (temperatures between 6500 and 3100 K) using infrared APOGEE-2 spectra. Atmospheric parameters were determined for 548 young stars in the Orion complex (Orion A, B, OB1, and $\lambda$ Ori) using the TONALLI code. For 340 slow rotators v sini $\leq$ 30 km s$^{-1}$), we derived C, Mg, Si, K, Ti, and Fe abundances using 19 atomic lines, MARCS model atmospheres, and BACCHUS. To mitigate the impact of circumstellar material, we excluded stars with infrared excess identified via 2MASS and WISE photometry. We find sub-solar [X/H] abundance ratios, consistent across elements and among all four groups, suggesting a chemically homogeneous Orion complex. We computed [$\alpha$/Fe] from [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], and [Ti/Fe], obtaining a median of $-0.14 \pm 0.04$, about 0.10 dex lower than the value for nearby main-sequence stars ($-0.04 \pm 0.04$) at similar [Fe/H]. This result aligns with predictions from Galactic chemical evolution models. Furthermore, the median [C/H] abundance we derived for Orion agrees with previous estimations based on the analysis of the ionized gas of the Orion nebula. This work sets the stage for extending the analysis to stars with circumstellar material and higher rotational velocities, which will not only improve our understanding of Orion, but also provide critical insight into the formation and evolution of young stars, as well as the chemical evolution of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze 4,859 O-stars in the OGLE-III photometric survey of the LMC, including 415 eclipsing binaries (EBs). After accounting for the geometrical probability of eclipses, the period distribution of O-type binaries across $P$ = 2.5-200 days follows a power-law $f_{\rm logP}$ $\propto$ (logP)$^{\Pi}$ with $\Pi$ = $-$0.34$\pm$0.06, which is skewed toward shorter periods compared to Opik's law ($\Pi$ = 0). We divide our O-stars into seven environments based on their clustering with B-stars and other O-stars. The EB fraction of O-stars in young clusters is 10.2%$\pm$0.6%, which matches the 10.8%$\pm$2.1% for O-stars in young Milky Way clusters. O-stars in old clusters exhibit a lower EB fraction of 5.5%$\pm$0.9% due to the effects of binary evolution. O-stars in young dense clusters, young sparse associations, and even low-mass clusters that formed in situ in the field have similar EB fractions. This uniformity suggests that the formation of close massive binaries depends on small-scale gas physics, e.g., fragmentation and migration within protostellar disks, whereas N-body interactions that scale with cluster density do not affect the close binary properties of massive stars that remain in clusters. Conversely, ejected O-stars in the field exhibit a lower close binary fraction. The EB fractions of field walkaways (projected velocities $v_{\rm proj}$ $<$ 24.5 km s$^{-1}$) and field runaways ($v_{\rm proj}$ $>$ 24.5 km s$^{-1}$) are 7.3%$\pm$1.0% and 4.7%$\pm$1.0%, respectively. These values suggest that most field O-stars were dynamically ejected via N-body interactions from their birth clusters, whereas field O-stars that formed in situ or were kicked from supernova explosions in binaries contribute 17% and $<$28%, respectively, to the field population.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the quenching mechanisms in dwarf galaxies is crucial for constraining models of galaxy formation and evolution. In this vein, isolated dwarf galaxies offer valuable insight by helping disentangle the relative roles of internal and environmental processes in shutting down star formation. Here we report the discovery of a quiescent early-type dwarf galaxy (dE), SDSS J011754.86+095819.0 (hereafter dE01+09), located in a nearly isolated environment at a projected distance of approximately one megaparsec from its most likely host group, the NGC 524 group. dE01+09 has M_r = -15.72 and g-r = 0.67 mag and its light profile is well described by a Sérsic function with an index n = 1.1, consistent with typical dEs. Using optical spectroscopy from the DESI survey, we derive its simple stellar population properties, finding an intermediate luminosity-weighted age of 8.3$\pm$1.4 Gyr and a subsolar metallicity of -1.19$\pm$0.21 dex -- characteristics comparable to those of classical quiescent dEs. We propose that NGC 524 may represent an extreme example of group dynamics, in which a member galaxy, dE01+09, is ejected from its host group and subsequently evolves as an isolated system in the field.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the alignment between the spin vectors of galaxy groups and the axes of their nearest cosmic filaments using the TNG300-1 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. By systematically analyzing a large sample of groups, we find a robust perpendicular alignment between group spin and filament orientation. Among all examined properties, only group mass and the distance to the nearest filament significantly affect the strength of this alignment: more massive groups and those closer to filaments exhibit a stronger perpendicular signal. In contrast, the alignment is largely insensitive to group richness, the stellar mass threshold used to select member galaxies, and redshift. We further quantify the bias introduced by using member galaxies as tracers of group spin, finding a typical misalignment angle of $\sim38^\circ$ between the spin measured from all dark matter particles and that inferred from member galaxies, independent of group richness or stellar mass cut. Our results provide a clear theoretical benchmark for interpreting observational measurements of spin-filament alignment and highlight the importance of considering group mass and environment. These findings help clarify the main factors influencing spin-filament alignment and provide useful context for future observational and theoretical studies of angular momentum in the cosmic web.
#### Forecasting 21-cm power spectrum sensitivity to dark Matter-baryon scattering

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20507

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the potential of upcoming 21-cm interferometric observations to probe interacting dark matter (IDM). We focus on scenarios where the dark matter-baryon scattering cross-section scales as $\sigma(v) =\sigma_{0} v^n$, with $\sigma_{0}$ being the normalization constant, $v$ the relative velocity between dark matter and baryons, and $n$ characterizing the velocity dependence. Specifically, we emphasize two cases: Coulomb-like interaction ($n = -4$) and velocity-independent interaction ($n = 0$). Using detailed simulations of the 21-cm power spectrum and the Fisher matrix formalism, we forecast the sensitivity of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), which targets the frequency range 50-225 MHz, to both IDM and astrophysical parameters. We marginalize over key astrophysical uncertainties, including star formation efficiency, ionizing photon escape fraction, and X-ray luminosity. Our results demonstrate that 21-cm power spectrum measurements can significantly improve sensitivity to IDM cross-section, with at least a factor of five improvement over global signal forecasts for the $n=0$ case, and more than an order of magnitude enhancement for the $n=-4$ scenario. These forecasts also significantly improve upon the existing bounds from cosmic microwave background and Milky Way satellite abundance observations. Our analysis also shows that the IDM cross-section exhibits no correlation with the parameters associated with star formation efficiency and ionizing photon escape fraction of Population-II stars. However, we find that the Coulomb-like cross-section is positively correlated with X-ray luminosity. Our results highlight the critical role of accounting for astrophysical uncertainties in obtaining robust inferences of dark matter-baryon interactions from future 21-cm power spectrum observations.
#### High-resolution models of the vertical shear instability

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) Context: The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism to generate turbulence and transport angular momentum in protoplanetary discs. While most recent work has focused on adding more complex physics, the saturation properties of the instability in radially extended discs and its convergence as a function of resolution are still largely unknown. We tackle the question of VSI saturation and associated turbulence using radially extended fully 3D global disc models at very high resolution so as to capture both the largest VSI scales and the small-scale turbulent cascade. We use the GPU-accelerated code Idefix to achieve resolutions of up to 200 points per scale height in the 3 spatial directions, with a full 2pi azimuthal extent and disc aspect ratio H/R=0.1. Results: We demonstrate that large-scale transport properties are converged with 100 points per scale height, leading to a Shakura-Sunyaev alpha=1.3e-3. Inner boundary condition artifacts propagate deep inside the computational domain, leading to reduced alpha in these regions. The large-scale corrugation wave zones identified in 2D models survive in 3D, albeit with less coherence. Our models show no sign of long-lived zonal flows, pressure bumps or vortices, in contrast to lower-resolution simulations. Finally, we show that the turbulent cascade resulting from VSI saturation can be interpreted in the framework of critically balanced rotating turbulence. Conclusion: The VSI leads to vigorous turbulence in protoplanetary discs, associated with outward angular momentum transport but without any significant long-lived features that could enhance planet formation. The innermost regions of VSI simulations are always polluted by boundary-condition artifacts affecting the first VSI wave train, so radially extended domains should be used in a more systematic manner.

 - **Abstract**
 The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect is associated with galaxy clusters - extremely large and dense structures tracing the dark matter with a higher bias than isolated galaxies. We propose to use the tSZ data to separate galaxies from redshift surveys into distinct subpopulations corresponding to different densities and biases independently of the redshift survey systematics. Leveraging the information from different environments, as in density-split and density-marked clustering, is known to tighten the constraints on cosmological parameters, like $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$ and neutrino mass. We use data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in their region of overlap to demonstrate informative tSZ splitting of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). We discover a significant increase in the large-scale clustering of DESI LRGs corresponding to detections starting from 1-2 sigma in the ACT DR6 + Planck tSZ Compton-$y$ map, below the cluster candidate threshold (4 sigma). We also find that such galaxies have higher line-of-sight coordinate (and velocity) dispersions and a higher number of close neighbors than both the full sample and near-zero tSZ regions. We produce simple simulations of tSZ maps that are intrinsically consistent with galaxy catalogs and do not include systematic effects, and find a similar pattern of large-scale clustering enhancement with tSZ effect significance. Moreover, we observe that this relative bias pattern remains largely unchanged with variations in the galaxy-halo connection model in our simulations. This is promising for future cosmological inference from tSZ-split clustering with semi-analytical models. Thus, we demonstrate that valuable cosmological information is present in the lower signal-to-noise regions of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich map, extending far beyond the individual cluster candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 Blackwidow and redback systems are millisecond pulsars in compact orbits with ultra-light and low-mass companions, respectively, collectively known as ``spider pulsars". In such systems, an intrabinary shock can form between the pulsar and the companion winds, serving as a site for particle acceleration and associated non-thermal emission. Assuming that protons can be extracted from the neutron star surface and accelerated at the intrabinary shock and/or within the pulsar wind, we model the very high-energy gamma-ray and neutrino emissions ($0.1-10^3$~TeV) produced through interactions with the companion wind and the companion star. We first calculate the high-energy emissions using an optimistic combination of parameters to maximize the gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes. We find that, for energetic spider pulsars with a spin-down power $\gtrsim 10^{35}\rm erg\, s^{-1}$ and a magnetic field of $\sim 10^{3}\, \rm G$ in the companion region, the gamma-ray emission could be detectable as point sources by CTA and LHAASO, while the neutrino emission could be detectable by the future TRIDENT detector. Finally, we build a synthetic population of these systems, compute the cumulative neutrino flux expected from spider pulsars, and compare it with the Galactic neutrino diffuse emission measured by IceCube. We find that, under realistic assumptions on the fraction of the spin-down power converted into protons, the contribution of spiders to the diffuse Galactic neutrino flux is negligible.
#### The power of binaries on stripped-envelope supernovae across metallicity: uniform progenitor parameter space and persistently low ejecta masses, but subtype diversity

 - **Abstract**
 Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) originate from massive stars that lose their envelopes through binary interactions or stellar winds. The connection between SESN subtypes and their progenitors remains poorly understood, as does the influence of initial mass, binarity, explodability, and metallicity on their evolutionary pathways, relative rates, ejecta masses, and progenitor ages. Here, we investigate these properties across a wide metallicity range (0.01-2 $Z_{\odot}$) using POSYDON, a state-of-the-art population synthesis code that incorporates detailed single- and binary-star model grids. We find that the common-envelope channel contributes less than 6% of SESNe, since unstable mass transfer is found less frequent than previously thought and rarely leads to CE survival when envelope binding energies are computed from detailed stellar models. The secondary channel accounts for less than 11%, while the vast majority of SESNe originate from primary stars in binaries undergoing stable mass-transfer episodes. These interactions maintain a largely metallicity-independent SESN parameter space, making the overall SESN rate almost insensitive to metallicity. In contrast, subtype fractions exhibit strong metallicity dependence, though their exact values remain affected by classification thresholds. The age distributions and therefore the progenitor masses of different SESN types also vary significantly with metallicity, revealing metallicity-dependent trends that can be tested observationally. Predicted SESN ejecta masses remain nearly constant across metallicity, in contrast to single-star models, and fall within observed ranges. Future transient surveys, combined with statistical environmental studies that constrain metallicity dependence, will provide decisive tests of these predictions and of the dominant role of binary interactions in shaping SESNe.
