#### Hybrid Approaches for Black Hole Spin Estimation: From Classical Spectroscopy to Physics-Informed Machine Learning

 - **Abstract**
 The measurement of black hole spin is considered one of the key problems in relativistic astrophysics. Existing methods, such as continuum fitting, X-ray reflection spectroscopy, and quasi-periodic oscillation analysis, suffer from limitations in accuracy, interpretability, and scalability. In this work, a hybrid approach is proposed in which theoretical models based on the Teukolsky formalism are integrated with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). A PINN model is developed to solve the linearized spin problem in the scalar case, with physical constraints directly embedded into the training process. Annotated data are not required; instead, the model is trained using the differential operator and boundary conditions as supervision. It is demonstrated that the PINN converges reliably, with residual loss values below 10 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) on the order of $10^{-7}$. Benchmarking results indicate that the proposed method outperforms both classical and data-driven machine learning approaches in terms of AUC and sensitivity, while also exhibiting superior interpretability, generalizability, and adherence to physical principles, with moderate computational cost. Potential extensions include integration with general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) solvers and application to real observational data. These findings support the viability of physics-based machine learning as a robust framework for accurate and interpretable black hole spin estimation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution ALMA [CII] 158 micron observations and JWST/NIRCam+MIRI imaging of MAMBO-9, a pair of optically-dark, dusty star-forming galaxies at $z=5.85$. MAMBO-9 is among the most massive, gas-rich, and actively star-forming galaxies at this epoch, when the Universe was less than 1 Gyr old. The new, 400 pc-resolution [CII] observations reveal velocity gradients in both objects; we estimate dynamical masses and find a relative mass ratio of 1:5. The kinematics of both objects suggest both rotation and strong tidal interaction, suggesting that the pair has already experienced a close encounter. Indeed, the new JWST imaging reveals a continuous bridge of moderately dust-obscured material between the two. We perform spatially-resolved SED fitting using the high-resolution ALMA+JWST imaging, finding that the majority of recent star-formation is concentrated in extremely obscured ($A_V > 10$) clouds, while the majority of rest-optical light (stellar continuum and H$\alpha$ emission) is emergent from moderate-to-highly obscured ($A_V\sim 1$-$5$) regions on the outskirts. Combining our new stellar and dynamical mass measurements with previous CO observations, we find that the mass budget of MAMBO-9 requires a CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$) of roughly unity, indicative of a highly metal-enriched ISM. Finally, we show that MAMBO-9 resides in a large overdensity spanning the PRIMER-COSMOS field, with 39 galaxies spectroscopically confirmed within $\sim 25$ cMpc. With a total baryonic mass $\sim 10^{11}\,M_\odot$, MAMBO-9 can be considered a prototype of massive galaxy formation and likely progenitor of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the lower-redshift Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the second data release (DR2) of the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxy formation, from the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, available at this http URL. DR2 includes all snapshots for most simulations, starting at z ~ 99, with all snapshot time spacings <~ 25 Myr. The Core suite -- comprising 14 Milky Way-mass galaxies, 5 SMC/LMC-mass galaxies, and 4 lower-mass galaxies -- includes 601 snapshots to z = 0. For the Core suite, we also release resimulations with physics variations: (1) dark-matter-only versions; (2) a modified ultraviolet background with later reionization at z = 7.8; (3) magnetohydrodynamics, anisotropic conduction, and viscosity in gas; and (4) a model for cosmic-ray injection, transport, and feedback (assuming a constant diffusion coefficient). The Massive Halo suite now includes 8 massive galaxies with 278 snapshots to z = 1. The High Redshift suite includes 34 simulations: in addition to the 22 simulations run to z = 5, we now include 12 additional simulations run to z = 7 and z = 9. Most simulations include catalogs of (sub)halos and galaxies at all available snapshots, and most Core simulations to z = 0 include full halo merger trees.

 - **Abstract**
 The vast majority of young stars hosting planet-forming disks exist within clustered environments, like the Orion Nebula, implying that seemingly `extreme' UV environments (10^4 G_0 and above) are not so atypical in the context of planet formation. Using thermo-chemical modeling, we explore how the temperature and chemistry within a protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star is impacted by the surrounding UV environment. The disk becomes hotter due to heating by photodissociation of molecules, photoelectric heating, H_2, and atomic processes and as a result the area in which molecules exist in the ice-phase shrinks, being pushed both downward and inward. Beyond 1AU the chemistry changes most significantly in a UV-rich background; the atmosphere becomes more H2O, OH, and atomic-rich. Hydrocarbons, however, reside primarily well within 1AU of the disk, thus their abundance and distribution is not impacted by the UV field, up to a 10^6 G0. The products of photodissociation and photochemistry are formed deeper into the disk with increasing UV background field strength beyond 1AU, impacting the chemistry near the midplane. Effectively a `reset' chemistry takes place, with an enhancement of atoms, simple molecules, and molecules in the gas-phase. Planets that form in highly irradiated regions will be exposed to a different chemical reservoir in the gas and ice-phases than that in an isolated disk, and the impact from the UV background should only be detectable in highly irradiated disks (~10^6 G_0).

 - **Abstract**
 The intense stellar irradiation of ultra-hot Jupiters results in some of the most extreme atmospheric environments in the planetary regime. On their daysides, temperatures can be sufficiently high for key atmospheric constituents to thermally dissociate into simpler molecular species and atoms. This dissociation drastically changes the atmospheric opacities and, in turn, critically alters the temperature structure, atmospheric dynamics, and day-night heat transport. To this date, however, simultaneous detections of the dissociating species and their thermally dissociation products in exoplanet atmospheres have remained rare. Here we present the simultaneous detections of H$_2$O and its thermally dissociation product OH on the dayside of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121 b based on high-resolution emission spectroscopy with the recently commissioned Near InfraRed Planet Searcher (NIRPS). We retrieve a photospheric abundance ratio of log$_{10}$(OH/H$_2$O) $= -0.15\pm{0.20}$ indicating that there is about as much OH as H$_2$O at photospheric pressures, which confirms predictions from chemical equilibrium models. We compare the dissociation on WASP-121 b with other ultra-hot Jupiters and show that a trend in agreement with equilibrium models arises. We also discuss an apparent velocity shift of $4.79^{+0.93}_{-0.97} $km s$^{-1}$ in the H$_2$O signal, which is not reproduced by current global circulation models. Finally, in addition to H$_2$O and OH, the NIRPS data reveal evidence of Fe and Mg, from which we infer a Fe/Mg ratio consistent with the solar and host star ratios. Our results demonstrate that NIRPS can be an excellent instrument to obtain simultaneous measurements of refractory and volatile molecular species, paving the way for many future studies on the atmospheric composition, chemistry, and the formation history of close-in exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 We argue that star formation in the disks of low-surface-brightness (LSB) galaxies shares a similar nature with that occurring in the far outer regions of normal-brightness spiral galaxies, such as those with the extended ultraviolet (XUV) disks. In both cases, stars are born in gravitationally stable disks with an extremely low average gas density (on kiloparsec scales), and the efficiency of this process depends on a disk brightness in a similar way. Processes which can stimulate star formation under these conditions are shortly discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) offer a unique environment for discovering and studying millisecond pulsars. In this paper, we present a multi-epoch search and detailed timing analysis of millisecond pulsars in the GC M2, using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope. We have discovered two new binary millisecond pulsars in M2, designated M2F and M2G, respectively. We provide measurements of the emission properties of all known pulsars in M2, including their polarization profiles, rotation measures, flux densities, scintillation characteristics, and so forth. In particular, we report the first rotation measure at the distance and direction of this cluster. Additionally, we report the first phase-coherent timing solutions for the M2 pulsars. From our Bayesian timing analysis, we have measured their spin and orbital parameters with high precision, including the advance of periastron for M2A and M2E indicating total system masses of 1.75(13) and 1.80(5) solar masses respectively. Using archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope, we have identified an optical counterpart of M2C, which is likely the white dwarf companion of the pulsar. By combining results from optical and radio observations, we have reconstructed the binary evolution track of this system and estimated the cooling age of the companion to be approximately 10\,Myr, making it the youngest white dwarf in any known GC binary pulsars. Furthermore, using the spin period derivatives of M2 pulsars, we have investigated the gravitational potential of the cluster and found that our results strongly support the latest central-stellar-velocity dispersion measurement in M2.

 - **Abstract**
 We identify a sample of 324 red and 273 blue face-on spiral galaxies selected from 115 low-redshift (0.014 < z < 0.18) galaxy clusters imaged with CFHT+MegaCam in u- and r-band, KPNO 0.9-meter 2TkA and MOSAIC 8K camera in B and Rc, and images and catalogs extracted from the WINGS survey. Multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy were obtained by cross-matching sources with SDSS, GALEX, and WISE datasets. Our main results suggest that up to 45% of optically red spirals are dusty compared to blue spiral galaxies based on infrared observations. The presence of dust can obscure star formation and hence lead to red spirals being misclassified as passive systems. Approximately half of the red spirals do not show evidence of a large abundance of dust, hence are optically red due to passive evolution. Support for the passive nature of these red spirals is provided by SDSS emission line data based on the Dn(4000) spectral index, EW(H-alpha), EW(H-delta), and [O III] 5007 A luminosity, and on a comparison of the star formation rate and the specific star formation rate with cluster blue spirals. Red spirals are an important link in the evolution of galaxies in the high-density cluster environment and play a key role in determining the physical mechanisms that are responsible for transforming blue star-forming galaxies into red spiral systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Many sub-Neptune and super-Earth exoplanets are expected to develop metal-enriched atmospheres due to atmospheric loss processes such as photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. Thermochemical equilibrium calculations predict that at high metallicity and a temperature range of 300-700 K, CO2 becomes the dominant carbon species, and graphite may be the thermodynamically favored condensate under low-pressure conditions. Building on prior laboratory findings that such environments yield organic haze rather than graphite, we measured the transmittance spectra of organic haze analogues and graphite samples, and computed their optical constants across the measured wavelength range from 0.4 to 25 {\mu}m. The organic haze exhibits strong vibrational absorption bands, notably at 3.0, 4.5, and 6.0 {\mu}m, while graphite shows featureless broadband absorption. The derived optical constants of haze and graphite provide the first dataset for organic haze analogues formed in CO2-rich atmospheres and offer improved applicability over prior graphite data derived from bulk reflectance or ellipsometry. We implemented these optical constants into the Virga and PICASO cloud and radiative transfer models to simulate transit spectra for GJ 1214b. The synthetic spectra with organic hazes reproduce the muted spectral features in the NIR observed by Hubble and general trends observed by JWST for GJ 1214b, while graphite models yield flat spectra across the observed wavelengths. This suggests haze features may serve as observational markers of carbon-rich atmospheres, whereas graphite's opacity could lead to radius overestimation, offering a possible explanation for super-puff exoplanets. Our work supplies essential optical to infrared data for interpreting observations of CO2-rich exoplanet atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents the first extended comparison of cosmic filaments identified in SDSS DR10 observations ($z < 0.05$) and the IllustrisTNG300-1 $\Lambda$CDM simulation ($z = 0$), utilizing the novel GrAviPaSt filament-finder method. The analyses are performed on both macro- and micro-filaments, each characterized by their length, thickness, and contrast in mass density. In addition to total sample comparisons, two subcategories of micro-filaments, GG (linking galaxy groups) and CC (linking galaxy clusters), are introduced to further analyze discrepancies between the $\Lambda$CDM model and observation. While $\Lambda$CDM produces extended macro-filaments, such structures are largely absent in SDSS, and where present, they exhibit higher densities than their simulated counterparts. Micro-filaments also show notable density discrepancies: at fixed length and thickness, observational filaments are significantly denser than those in the simulation. Employing radial density profiles reveal that micro-filaments in the $\Lambda$CDM simulation exhibit higher contrasts in mass density relative to the background compared to their observational counterparts. Notably, CC type micro-filaments displayed enhanced density contrasts over GG types in the simulation, while observational data showed the opposite trend. Furthermore, SDSS galaxies in both GG and CC micro-filaments exhibit lower specific star formation rates (sSFR) and older stellar populations, while TNG300-1 micro-filaments host more actively star-forming galaxies within the intermediate stellar mass range. These results reveal persistent discrepancies between observational data and the $\Lambda$CDM reconstruction of cosmic filaments, pointing to possible tensions in our current understanding of large-scale structures and their environmental effects on galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The cluster environment can have a significant impact on galaxy evolution. We study the impact that passage through a cluster has on stellar and ionised gas kinematics for galaxies within the Sydney-AAO Multi Integral field (SAMI) Galaxy Survey. We compute the kinematic asymmetry $v_{\rm asym}$ in the line-of-sight stellar and ionsied gas velocity maps to quantify how the cluster environment disturbs the kinematics of the stars and ionised gas. We find a significantly higher fraction of galaxies with elevated gas asymmetries in clusters compared to non-cluster environments (17$^{+2}_{-3}$\%, 26/154 vs. 11$^{+1}_{-1}$\%, 72/751), with these galaxies most likely being recent infallers passage based on their position in projected-phase-space. Compared to cluster galaxies without elevated gas asymmetries, cluster galaxies with elevated gas asymmetries have, on average, more centrally concentrated star-formation. Finally, we find the highest fraction of galaxies with elevated gas asymmetries in clusters likely to host significant substructure or be dynamically complex. Our findings are consistent with the scenario of galaxies falling into clusters, either individually or in groups, and undergoing disk-fading and a redistribution of gas, due to ram pressure stripping experienced during pericentre passage.

 - **Abstract**
 OB associations, as an intermediate stage between Galactic clusters and field stars, play an important role in understanding the star formation process, early stellar evolution, and Galactic evolution. In this work, we construct a large sample of OB stars with 6D phase space parameters ($l, b, d, V_{\rm los}, pmra ,pmdec$) by combining the distances from Bailer-Jones et al. (2021), radial velocities derived from low-resolution spectra of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), and proper motions from the \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3 (DR3). This sample includes 19,933 OB stars, most of which are located within 6\,kpc of the Sun. Using 6D phase space parameters and friends-of-friends clustering algorithm, we identify 67 OB associations and 112 OB association candidates, among them, 49 OB associations and 107 OB association candidates are newly identified. The Galactic rotation curve derived using 67 OB association members is relatively flat in the range of Galactocentric distances 7$<$$R$$<$13\,kpc. The angular rotation velocity at solar Galactocentric distance of $R_\odot$ =8.34\,kpc is $\Omega_0$ = 29.05$\pm$0.55\,km\,s$^{-1}$\,kpc$^{-1}$. The spatial distribution of the 67 OB associations indicates that they are mainly located at low Galactic latitudes and near spiral arms of the Milky Way. Additionally, we estimate the velocity dispersions and sizes of these 67 OB associations. Our results show that the velocity dispersions decrease as Galactocentric distances increase, while their sizes increase as Galactocentric distances increase.
#### No Metallicity Preference in Fast Radio Burst Host Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic radio transients of unknown origin, and studying their host galaxies could offer clues to constrain progenitor models. Among various host properties, gas-phase metallicity is a key factor influencing stellar evolution and the production of transients. We analyze the largest uniformly selected sample of FRB host galaxies to date, measuring oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H) = 8.04-8.84) for 40 hosts using consistent emission-line diagnostics. Using a volume-limited subsample, we compare the distributions of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and metallicity to a control sample of star-forming galaxies matched in the same selection criteria. We find that FRB host galaxies span a wide range in metallicity and are broadly consistent with the SFR-weighted mass-metallicity relation of the star-forming galaxy population. Contrary to the earlier claim in the literature, we find no clear lower bound on metallicity, suggesting that metallicity alone does not strictly regulate FRB production. Encouragingly, this implies FRBs can form even in low-metallicity, high-redshift galaxies, supporting their potential as probes of matter distribution across cosmic time. Additionally, we find marginal ($\sim$2$\sigma$) evidence for a -0.09 $\pm$ 0.04 dex metallicity offset from the fundamental metallicity relation, likely due to suppressed SFRs at fixed mass and metallicity rather than metal deficiency. This offset resembles that observed in local post-merger galaxies, and may reflect a post-starburst phase following galaxy interactions, where FRB progenitors formed during the starburst produce FRBs after a 100-500 Myr delay, consistent with observed delay-time distributions and favoring binary evolution channels over core-collapse supernovae.
#### Reionization in Protocluster Environments at $z>7$ with JWST/NIRSpec

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the role of high-redshift protoclusters in cosmic reionization is essential to unveiling the early stages of structure formation. Using deep imaging and spectroscopy from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) JADES Deep Survey in GOODS-South, we identify two prominent protoclusters at z>7 and investigate their environmental properties in comparison to field galaxies. Protocluster members exhibit systematically higher ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{\text{ion}}$) and inflated [OIII]/H$\beta$ ratios at fixed UV magnitude or stellar mass, likely driven by young, metal-poor stellar populations and intense star formation. Despite these properties, their Ly$\alpha$ emission is weak or absent, and they show high proximate neutral hydrogen column densities, suggesting insufficient ionizing output to maintain ionized bubbles. We also find that a strong Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE), JADES-GS-z7-LA, may lie within the same ionized region as one protocluster. Although their Lyman continuum escape fractions ($f_{\mathrm{esc}} \sim 0.1$) are comparable to those of LAEs, individual protocluster galaxies are faint ($M_{\mathrm{UV}} > -19$) and low-mass ($\log(M_*/M_\odot) \sim 8.5$). The enhanced number density within protoclusters boosts the local UV luminosity density by nearly 1 dex. The surrounding gas remains largely neutral, suggesting that reionization was highly patchy and modulated by environment. The protocluster galaxies likely host ionization-bounded nebulae with holes, suppressing Ly$\alpha$ visibility, in contrast to field galaxies that are more consistent with density-bounded nebulae.
#### Do Rocky Planets around M Stars Have Atmospheres? A Statistical Approach to the Cosmic Shoreline

 - **Abstract**
 Answering the question "do rocky exoplanets around M stars have atmospheres?" is a key science goal of the JWST mission, with 500 hours of Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) awarded to address it. Theoretically, the so-called "Cosmic Shoreline" may not hold around M stars due to their harsher XUV environment, possibly resulting in most rocky planets lacking significant atmospheres -- a hypothesis that remains to be statistically tested through judicious target selection. We identify target selection as a combinatorial optimization problem ("knapsack problem"). We develop a statistical framework to test population-level hypotheses from observations and combine a formation and evolution model, 1D-RCE atmosphere model, and genetic algorithm to simulate populations and find the optimal set of observations. We find that, firstly, if all rocky planets around M stars are indeed bare rocks, JWST can efficiently place an upper bound on the atmosphere occurrence rates to less than 1 in 8, even without optimized target selection, but further improvements to the constraint are cost-prohibitive. Secondly, if the Cosmic Shoreline hypothesis (XUV or bolometric) holds true for M stars, strong evidence ($\Delta$BIC>5) can be found within ~500 observing hours using the optimal strategy of a "wide and shallow" approach. Our statistical framework can be directly applied to upcoming observations to robustly identify the Cosmic Shoreline and to optimize target selection for determining other trends in exoplanet atmosphere observations, including those from future missions.
