 - **Abstract**
 Recent developments in AI techniques for space applications mirror the success achieved in terrestrial applications. Machine learning, which excels in data rich environments, is particularly well suited to space-based computer vision applications, such as space optical attitude sensing. Of these sensors, digital sun sensors (DSS) are one of the most common and important sensors for spacecraft attitude determination. The main challenge in using the DSS for attitude estimation are sensor errors, which limit the overall achievable estimation accuracy. However, the traditional sun sensor calibration process is costly, slow, labor-intensive and inefficient. These limitations motivate the use of AI techniques to enable more accurate and efficient DSS calibration. The objective of this work is to develop an end-to-end predictive calibration methodology for digital sun sensors to solve 2-axis state estimates utilizing a sparse submanifold convolutional neural network (SSCNN). We find that the proposed framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance on synthetic data with a mean accuracy of 0.005° for the two sun angle estimates. Furthermore, the model is highly capable of implicitly learning complex noise patterns and handling mixed noise types, thereby greatly improving the model robustness and accuracy to real-world applications. The main contributions of this work are: (1) the first application (to our knowledge) of a CNN regression model to the problem of DSS predictive calibration, (2) the introduction of a fused end-to-end training approach for DSS calibration, (3) the creation of a publicly available physics-informed synthetic dataset and simulation for DSS training images, and (4) the evaluation of the performance of the deep learning approach for various mask configurations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of Pegasus V and Pisces VII, along with a re-analysis of the archival imaging of Pegasus W, and Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) neutral gas (HI) observations of all three. These three ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) are all within the Local Group in the approximate direction of M31. The VLA observations place stringent upper limits on their HI content, with all having $M_\mathrm{HI} < 10^4\;\mathrm{M_\odot}$. As the red giant branches of these UFDs are sparsely populated, we determined distances from the HST photometry of horizontal branch (HB) stars in comparison to a fiducial HB population (from M92), with all three falling in the range 0.7-1 Mpc. Using a new Python-based star formation history (SFH) fitting code (based on StarFISH), we derive SFHs of all three UFDs. As found previously, the best fit SFH for Pegasus W includes significant star formation well beyond the end of reionization, while the SFHs calculated for Pegasus V and Pisces VII are consistent with them having quenched shortly after reionization. These findings for the latter two objects indicate that, like those in the vicinity of the Milky Way, lower mass UFDs in the vicinity of M31 likely quenched at early times.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation and evolution of galaxies are intricately linked to the baryon cycle, which fuels star formation while shaping chemical abundances within galaxies. Investigating the relationship between star formation and metallicity for large samples of galaxies requires expensive IFU surveys or sophisticated tools to analyze grism data. Here we analyze JWST NIRISS slitless grism data using Sleuth, a tool that forward models and infers spatially resolved physical properties from grism data, including observations from JWST NIRISS/NIRCam and future grism data like that from the Roman Space Telescope. Sleuth enables extraction of high-quality emission line maps from slitless spectra, overcoming contamination and spatially varying stellar populations, which previously limited such studies. Utilizing Sleuth with data from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS), we investigated the relationship between metallicity and star formation in the star-forming clumps of galaxies at 0.6 < z < 1.35. We analyzed a sample of 20 galaxies, extracted high-quality emission line maps with Sleuth, and analyzed, in detail, the spatially resolved properties of star-forming clumps. Using $H\alpha$, [SII], and [SIII] emission line maps, we examined the spatially resolved metallicities, ionization, and star formation rates of our sample. Our findings reveal that these star-forming clumps show lower metallicities ($\sim$ 0.1 dex) than their surrounding galactic environments, indicating a metallicity dilution of 20 $\%$ within the clumps' gas. Our analysis indicates that these clumps exhibit intensified star formation and reduced metallicity, likely due to the inflow of metal-poor gas. These clumps illustrate the dynamic relationship between star formation and chemical enrichment within galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars in the Milky Way disk exhibit a clear separation into two chemically distinct populations based on their [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios. This $\alpha$-bimodality is not a universal feature of simulated disk galaxies and may point to a unique evolutionary history. A popular explanation is the two-infall scenario, which postulates that two periods of substantial accretion rates dominate the assembly history of the Galaxy. Thanks to recent advances in stellar age measurements, we can now compare this model to more direct measurements of the Galaxy's evolutionary timescales across the disk. We run multi-zone galactic chemical evolution models with a two-infall-driven star formation history and compare the results against abundance patterns from APOGEE DR17, supplemented with stellar ages estimated through multiple methods. Although the two-infall scenario offers a natural explanation for the $\alpha$-bimodality, it struggles to explain several features of the age--abundance structure in the disk. First, our models generically predict a massive and long-lasting dilution event, but the data show that stellar metallicity is remarkably constant across much of the lifetime of the disk. This apparent age-independence places considerable restrictions upon the two-infall parameter space. Second, most local metal-rich stars in APOGEE have intermediate ages, yet our models predict these stars should either be very old or very young. Some of these issues can be mitigated, but not completely resolved, by pre-enriching the accreted gas to low metallicity. These restrictions also place limits on the role of merger events in shaping the chemical evolution of the thin disk.
#### HST Observations of the CV Propeller LAMOST J024048.51+195226.9

 - **Abstract**
 We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) FUV spectra and light curves of the magnetic cataclysmic variable (CV) LAMOST J024048.51+195226.9 (J0240), the second known CV propeller. The five consecutive HST orbits span a full 7.34 hour binary orbital period. We detect a 24.939 $\pm$ 0.006 s FUV modulation, confirming that J0240 contains the fastest spinning white dwarf (WD) in a CV. A high N V/C IV emission line ratio is considered an indicator of a recent episode of thermal time-scale mass transfer. The observed ratio in J0240 is higher than seen in typical magnetic CVs, but far less than observed in the only other confirmed propeller, AE Aquarii (AE Aqr). We also find that J0240 is significantly less luminous than AE Aqr during both low- and high-flux states. Around orbital phase 0.5, the Si IV emission line displays a P-Cygni absorption profile likely related to the gas accelerated in the propeller. We derive new mass-dependent temperature limits for the surface temperature of the WD of T $\leq$ 11,000-15,000 K. This temperature is low enough to allow for WD core crystallization, which may be linked to magnetism in WDs, particularly those in CVs.
#### Disks no more: the morphology of low-mass simulated galaxies in FIREbox

 - **Abstract**
 We study the morphology of hundreds of simulated central galaxies in the stellar mass range $M_\star=10^{7.5} \rm - 10^{11}~$\msun\, from the FIREbox cosmological volume. We demonstrate that FIREbox is able to predict a wide variety of morphologies, spanning from disk-dominated objects to spheroidal galaxies supported by stellar velocity dispersion. However, the simulations predict a strong relation between morphology (degree of rotational support) and stellar mass: galaxies comparable to the Milky Way are often disk-dominated while the presence of stellar disks mostly vanishes for dwarfs with $M_\star <10^9 ~$\msun. This defines a ``morphology transition'' regime for galaxies with $10^9 <M_\star/\rm{M_\odot}< 10^{10}$ in which disks become increasingly common, but below which disks are rare. We show that burstiness in the star formation history and the deepening of the gravitational potential strongly correlate in our simulations with this transition regime, with disks forming in objects with lower levels of burstiness in the last $\sim 6$ Gyr and halos with mass $\sim 10^{11} ~ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ and above. While observations support a transition towards thicker disks in the regime of dwarfs, our results are in partial disagreement with observations of at least some largely rotationally supported gas disks in dwarfs with $M_\star < 10^9$\msun. This study highlights dwarf morphology as a fundamental benchmark for testing future galaxy formation models.

 - **Abstract**
 The morphology and kinematics of atomic Hydrogen (HI) gas in galaxies are influenced by both local and large scale cosmic environments. Differences in galaxy environment and interactions can leave distinct signatures in HI asymmetry, offering insight into environmental effects on galaxy evolution. We investigate the role of environment on HI asymmetries in galaxies located in two contrasting structures: the Ursa Major (UMa) group and the Perseus Pisces (PP) filament. We analyze HI 21cm imaging from the WSRT and the VLA, homogenized in resolution for fair comparison. Asymmetries in global profiles and column density maps are measured using criteria established in arXiv:2205.00675 and compared to those of mock galaxies presented in the same study. The PP volume hosts a higher fraction of galaxies with asymmetric global HI profiles (33%) compared to UMa (9%). Likewise, 46% of PP galaxies have morphological HI asymmetries above 0.5 at a threshold of 15 x 10^19 cm^-2, compared to 13% in UMa. The greater column density sensitivity of the UMa data enables detection of lopsided features and asymmetry measurement down to 5 x 10^19 cm^-2. We also identify simulated galaxies with unphysical asymmetries likely caused by unrealistic feedback. In both volumes, stellar and HI morphological asymmetries are uncorrelated. Global profile and morphological asymmetries are also found to be uncorrelated, consistent with previous results.

 - **Abstract**
 Beyond deepening our understanding of the formation, growth, and evolution of supermassive black holes, it is crucial to uncover the role of feeding and feedback processes from growing black holes (i.e., active galactic nucleus; AGN) in shaping the cosmic ecosystem. Such studies include understanding the dynamics of gas flows in the interstellar (ISM), circumgalactic (CGM), intracluster (ICM), and intergalactic media (IGM). As the output of a sub-group in Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) AGN Working Group, this Science Case Development Document (SCDD) proposes to use future HWO observations to solve the following questions. Which mechanism is dominant in triggering inflows/outflows through feedback? How is AGN activity triggered, and is it associated with circumnuclear star formation and what is the overall effect of AGN feedback on star formation (SF)? In AGN feedback, which mode is more influential and does AGN feedback operate similarly or differently in the local universe and at high redshift? To answer these questions, this SCDD proposes to use potential HWO observations as follows. Resolve and characterize the spatial distribution of ionized and cold/warm molecular gas, especially those in inflows/outflows; Explore the spatial coupling and potential stratification of multi-phase inflows/outflows on different physical scales and their resolved and global correlations with AGN and/or SF activities; Investigate whether corresponding outflows/jets induce shocks and/or fluctuations that trigger or suppress the formation of molecular clouds and hence new stars. Specifically, HWO's capabilities will enable us to achieve the above scientific goals while existing facilities lack the required combination of high-throughput ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) integral field unit (IFU) capabilities with simultaneously sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity.

 - **Abstract**
 With excellent spectral and angular resolutions and, especially, sensitivity, the JWST allows us to observe infrared emission lines that were previously inaccessible or barely accessible. These emission lines are promising for evaluating the physical conditions in different galaxies. Based on {\sc MAPPINGS V} photoionization models, we systematically analyze the dependence of over 20 mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission lines covered by the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard JWST on the physical conditions of different galactic environments, in particular narrow line regions (NLRs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that mid-IR emission lines of highly ionized argon (i.e., [Ar~{\small V}]7.90,13.10) and neon (i.e., [Ne~{\small V}]14.32,24.32, [Ne~{\small VI}]7.65) are effective in diagnosing the physical conditions in AGN. We accordingly propose new prescriptions to constrain the ionization parameter ($U$), peak energy of the AGN spectrum ($E_{\rm peak}$), metallicity ($\rm 12+log (O/H)$), and gas pressure ($P/k$) in AGN. These new calibrations are applied to the central regions of six Seyfert galaxies included in the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS) as a proof of concept. We also discuss the similarity and difference in the calibrations of these diagnostics in AGN of different luminosities, highlighting the impact of hard X-ray emission and particularly radiative shocks, as well as the different diagnostics in star-forming regions. Finally, we propose diagnostic diagrams involving [Ar~{\small V}]7.90 and [Ne~{\small VI}]7.65 to demonstrate the feasibility of using the results of this study to distinguish galactic regions governed by different excitation sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic millisecond-duration signals which encode otherwise unattainable information on the plasma which permeates our Universe, providing insights into magnetic fields and gas distributions. Here we report the discovery of FRB 20240304B originating at redshift 2.148 +/- 0.001 corresponding to just 3 billion years after the Big Bang. FRB 2024030 was detected with the MeerKAT radio telescope and localized to a low-mass, clumpy, star forming galaxy using the James Webb Space Telescope. This discovery doubles the redshift reach of localized FRBs and probes ionized baryons across ~80% of cosmic history. Its sightline, intersecting the Virgo Cluster and a foreground group, reveals magnetic field complexity over many gigaparsec scales. Our observations establish FRB activity during the peak of cosmic star formation and demonstrate that FRBs can probe galaxy formation during the most active era in cosmic time.
#### The multi-faceted variability of HD 192639: Stochastic behaviour, regularities, and an exceptional mass-ejection event

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic and photometric variability is widespread among O-type supergiants. It is linked to various phenomena affecting the star and its circumstellar environment, thereby providing direct information concerning them. To investigate such connections, we decided to revisit the prototypical O7.5 Iabf supergiant HD 192639. High-cadence spectroscopic monitoring was performed simultaneously with intensive space-borne photometric observations. The data were analysed with several methods to characterise the variability. Besides the usual stochastic, low-frequency photometric variability, our observations reveal the presence of recurrent - but transient - modulations on a timescale of about five days. The same signal is present in the spectroscopic data and was already seen two decades ago. This stability suggests that this timescale corresponds to the stellar rotation. Furthermore, our observations unveil, for the first time, an unusually strong dimming event in the light curve associated with absorption and emission changes in H I and He I lines. This unprecedented trough corresponds to an episodic ejection of a rather large amount of mass (its column density being comparable to that of the steady wind). While rare, such an event could hint at an overlooked aspect of mass loss in massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The increasing availability of high-quality optical and near-infrared spectroscopic data, as well as advances in modelling techniques, have greatly expanded the scientific potential of spectroscopic studies. However, the software tools needed to fully exploit this potential often remain fragmented across multiple specialised packages, requiring scripting skills and manual integration to handle complex workflows. In this paper we present SPAN (SPectral ANalysis), a cross-platform, Python-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) software that unifies the essential tools for modern spectral analysis within a single, user-friendly environment. While SPAN can be used with a variety of spectroscopic targets, its primary focus is the analysis of unresolved galaxy spectra. SPAN allows users to extract 1D spectra from FITS images and datacubes, perform spectral processing (e.g. Doppler correction, continuum modelling, denoising), and carry out detailed analyses, including line-strength measurements, stellar and gas kinematics, and stellar population studies, using both built-in routines and the widely adopted pPXF algorithm for full spectral fitting. It runs natively on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android, and is fully task-driven, requiring no prior coding experience. We validate SPAN by comparing its output with existing pipelines and literature studies. By offering a flexible, accessible, and well integrated environment, SPAN simplifies and accelerates the spectral analysis workflow, while maintaining scientific accuracy.
#### Effect of magnetic field inclination on black hole jet power and particle acceleration

 - **Abstract**
 Rotating black holes are known to launch relativistic jets and accelerate particles provided they accrete a magnetized plasma. However, it remains unclear how the global magnetic field orientation affects the jet powering efficiency. Here, we propose the first kinetic study of a collisionless plasma around a Kerr black hole that is embedded in a magnetic field inclined with respect to the black hole's spin axis. Using three-dimensional general-relativistic particle-in-cell simulations, we show that while oblique magnetic field configurations significantly reduce the jet power, particle acceleration remains highly efficient regardless. This suggests that black holes producing a weak jet could still be bright sources of nonthermal radiation and cosmic rays.

 - **Abstract**
 A sample of objects with steep and ultra-steep spectra was prepared from radio sources of the Cold experiment surveys conducted on the RATAN-600 radio telescope. It formed the basis for the Big Trio program for searching for distant radio galaxies. With the advent of high-sensitivity, high-angular-resolution radio sky surveys, as well as deep optical and infrared surveys, it became possible to conduct additional studies of the sample. We refined the morphology and spectra of continuous radio emissions from radio galaxies. A detailed study of the morphological features of the sample sources revealed that 4 of the sample sources are formed by close radio sources with a distance of about 60 kpc between the parent galaxies. 8% of the radio sources demonstrate a restart of activity in the radio range, 20% of the sources are in an environment that leads to the deformation of the lobes, 11% are young sources and 2% are fading. A high percentage of sources with a variability index greater than 3 is associated with a large difference in the angular resolution of the compared TXS and VCSS surveys, as well as an underestimated flux density for some double sources in the latter survey. Comparison of spectral indices obtained from old and new data showed that in the studied sample the share of sources with steep spectra has significantly decreased. Most likely, this is due to the addition of low-frequency GLEAM data, although for some radio sources a possible evolution of the continuum spectrum over an interval of several decades is not excluded -- a shift towards low frequencies.

 The space-based CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) mission aims to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed at developing new CubeSat missions. As part of CUSP's Phase B study, which began in December 2024 and will last one year, we present the current development status of the design solutions adopted for the mission's most critical multi-physics design drivers. These solutions have been formulated and applied to demonstrate compliance with system requirements at both the spacecraft and platform levels. In particular, we describe the mechanical design of each structural component, the results of static, dynamic finite element analyses, and a proposal for topological optimization of the interface between the platform and payload and some fixture for test, and the preliminary environmental testing campaign (e.g., vibration, shock) that will be carried out on a mechanical demonstrator.
#### Spectroscopic Confirmation: Fast rotators in the young clusters NGC 1856 and NGC 1953

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a spectroscopic investigation of two Large Magellanic Cloud globular clusters, NGC 1953 and NGC 1856. Both clusters have similar ages (250 and 300 Myr, respectively). Spectra were recorded with the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System located on the Magellan-Clay 6.5m telescope. Spectra were visually inspected to assess the presence of stellar H$\alpha$ emission lines attributed to B stars rotating close to breakup velocity (Be stars). High fractions of Be stars in the cluster typically indicate the presence of a large population of fast rotating stars, predicted by some models to explain the observed split and extended main sequence. There are numerous Be star candidates in NGC 1856, exhibiting weak but broad H$\alpha$ emission. However, only one such target was detected in NGC 1953. This stark contrast between the observed populations for NGC 1856 and NGC 1953 may suggest that cluster density plays a key role in determining the fraction of Be stars. These results provide essential constraints for the different scenarios attempting to explain the bimodal distribution of rotational velocities and the multiple populations of stars observed in globular clusters. The impact of stellar radial velocity and nebular emission on photometric measures is assessed through simulations relying on the spectra. These simulations suggest that photometric studies can under-estimate the fraction of H$\alpha$ emitters in a cluster, in particular for stars with relatively weak emission features. The results also show that nebular emission has minimal impact on the photometric H$\alpha$ excesses.
