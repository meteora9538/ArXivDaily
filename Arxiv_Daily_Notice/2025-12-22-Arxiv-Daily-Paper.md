 - **Abstract**
 We present new constraints on the Mass -- Metallicity (MZR) and Fundamental Metallicity Relations (FMR) using a sample of 34 galaxies at $1.38\leq~z\leq~3.5$ (median $z=2.28$). These galaxies have direct $T_e$ measurements from [O\sc{iii}]4363Å~and/or [O\sc{ii}]7320,7331Å~auroral emission lines detected with \textit{JWST}/NIRSpec as part of the AURORA survey. The detection of both oxygen auroral lines allows for dual-zone direct $T_e$ measurements and expands the dynamic range in $12+\log\mathrm{(O/H)}$ (7.68 to 8.65 dex), stellar mass ($10^{8}$ to $10^{10.4}$ M$_\odot$), and star-formation rate ($1$ to $100$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) compared to previous direct $T_e$ studies of the high-redshift MZR and FMR. We characterize the $z\sim2$ MZR and find a slope of $0.27\pm0.04$ and normalization of $12+\log\mathrm{(O/H)} = 8.44\pm0.04$ at $10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ with an intrinsic scatter of 0.10 dex, consistent with past strong-line MZR measurements. Comparisons with $z\sim2$ predictions from six simulations reveal that none reproduce our observed MZR normalization evolution between $z\sim0$ and $z\sim2$. This discrepancy suggests current models do not fully capture the chemical enrichment and feedback processes occurring at cosmic noon. However, all 34 galaxies are on or above the star-forming main sequence such that our sample may be biased towards lower $12+\log\mathrm{(O/H)}$ if the FMR persists at $z\sim2$. Correcting for this selection effect would increase O/H by $\approx0.1$ dex at 10$^{9.3}$ M$_\odot$ (the median mass of our sample) bringing our MZR into better agreement with that of \texttt{TNG}. Lastly, we find our $z\sim2.3$ sample is consistent with the $z\sim0$ FMR within 0.1 dex in O/H, indicating that the smooth secular mechanisms regulating chemical enrichment, star formation, stellar mass, and outflows were in place at cosmic noon.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic Middle Ages, spanning the last 8-10 Gyr of the Universe, is a critical period in which massive early-formed systems coexist with global star formation quenching in less massive galaxies, yet galaxies experience further dynamical, morphological and chemical evolution. Understanding the relative role of internal drivers and of interaction with the evolving large-scale structures remains a highly complex and unsettled issue. To make transformative progress on these questions we must characterize the physical and kinematic properties (integrated and spatially resolved) of stellar populations in galaxies, fossil record of their past star formation and assembly histories, together with gas properties, across a wide range of masses and environmental scales, over this critical cosmic epoch. Volume-representative samples of 10^6 galaxies down to 10^9 solar masses are essential to fully trace the complex interplay between physical processes and to physically connect progenitor and descendant galaxy populations. This demands a deep and extensive survey with high signal-to-noise, medium-resolution, rest-frame optical spectroscopy. Current and planned facilities in the 2020-2030s cannot simultaneously achieve the required sample size, spectral quality, mass limit, and spatial coverage. A dedicated large-aperture spectroscopic facility with wide-area high-multiplex MOS and large field-of-view IFU is needed to provide transformative insights into the physical mechanisms regulating star formation and galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 A deep understanding of the life-cycle of galaxies, particularly those of high mass, requires clarifying the mechanisms that regulate star formation (SF) and its abrupt shutdown (quenching), often capable of stopping SF rates of hundreds of solar masses per year. What initially triggers quenching, and what sustains the quiescent state thereafter, especially given the frequent presence of large gas reservoirs or even massive gas inflows, are unsolved key issues. Ultimately, the crucial connection between the galaxy life-cycle and the surrounding Intergalactic (IGM) and Circumgalactic (CGM) Medium remains largely unclear. Addressing these issues requires studying star formation, chemical enrichment, and quenching homogeneously up to high redshift. The upcoming AO-assisted Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), will deliver sharper and deeper data than the JWST. SHARP is a concept study for a near-IR (0.95-2.45 mu) spectrograph designed to fully exploit the capabilities of ELT. Designed for multi-object slit spectroscopy and multi-Integral Field spectroscopy, SHARP points to achieve angular resolutions (~30 mas) far superior to NIRSpec at JWST(100 mas) to decipher and reconstruct the life-cycle oa galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation in the chemically ancient, dynamically heated Galactic thick disc remains poorly constrained, owing to the expectation that its low solid reservoirs, short disc lifetimes, and harsh irradiation environments inhibit efficient assembly of planetary bodies. However, an increasing number of confirmed thick disc planet hosts now challenge this view, indicating that planetary formation and survival in the early Milky Way may have been more resilient -- and more diverse -- than standard disc-evolution models suggest. Here we present a homogeneous characterisation of 38 exoplanetary systems orbiting bona fide thick disc stars, combining new detections with a systematic reassessment of archival systems. High-precision radial velocities and space-based transit photometry, combined with uniform high-resolution spectroscopy, yield self-consistent stellar and planetary parameters, and thick disc membership is secured via joint chemical and kinematic criteria. Among these systems, we identify two remarkably low-density, inflated planets -- TOI-1927 b and TOI-2643 b -- representing the first puffy planets known to orbit thick disc stars, and an outcome that is highly unexpected in metal-poor environments, thereby challenging current models of atmospheric retention and thermal inflation at low metallicity. This consolidated sample establishes a new empirical baseline for understanding how planetary architectures emerge under the depleted, short-lived discs characteristic of the early Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Due to their high equilibrium temperatures ($T_{eq}$ $>$ 2000 K), ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are the best characterized exoplanets to date. However, many questions about their formation, evolution, and atmospheres remain unanswered. Phase curve observations can reveal answers to these questions by constraining multiple atmospheric properties including circulation, albedo, and chemistry. To this end, we simulate and forecast a survey of UHJ atmospheres via phase curve observations with the upcoming $\textit{Twinkle}$ mission. $\textit{Twinkle}$ is a spectroscopic satellite covering 0.5--4.5 micron with a spectral resolving power of R $\sim$ 50--70. Using a physically motivated model, we simulate white-light photometric phase curve observations for 14 UHJs in $\textit{Twinkle's}$ field of regard. We project that $\textit{Twinkle}$ will be able to detect all phase curve signals in our survey. Additionally, we simulate spectroscopic phase curves for the UHJ, WASP-189b. From our simulated spectroscopic phase curves, we generate mock phase-resolved emission spectra. Previously detected UHJ molecules (e.g. H$_2$O, CO and CO$_2$) produce notable features in the resulting spectra, allowing for detailed atmospheric characterization to study the 3D structure of UHJ atmospheric chemistry and dynamics. For planets with hotspot phase offsets, $\textit{Twinkle}$ will be capable of detecting them both in the optical and infrared wavelength ranges. This future survey would represent the first UHJ phase curve survey with simultaneous coverage in optical and infrared wavelengths and will provide new constraints and reveal intriguing trends in these extreme environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The high magnetic fields and rapid spins of young pulsars associated with supernova remnants, such as the Crab and the Vela, established the standard pulsar model in which massive stellar explosions produce rapidly rotating, radio-luminous neutron stars. Central Compact Objects (CCOs), identified in X-rays at the centers of other remnants, challenged this view, as decades of searches yielded no radio detections. Here we show that the prototypical young CCO 1E 1207.4-5209 is in fact a faint radio pulsar rotating at the 0.4s X-ray period. Analysis of its polarization indicates that the radio beam intersects our line of sight near the magnetic pole, affirming its radio faintness' being intrinsic. Once its supernova remnant dissipates, this source would be misidentified as an apparently gigayear-old pulsar. The CCO's low radio flux density may explain why many supernova remnants lack detectable radio pulsars and suggests a hidden population of young, slowly rotating neutron stars.
#### Uncovering the population of compact binary mergers and their formation pathways with gravitational waves through the Einstein Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 Ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories have transformed our view of compact-object mergers, yet their reach still limits a comprehensive reconstruction of the processes that generate these systems. Only next-generation observatories, with order-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity and access to lower frequencies, will be capable of radically extending this detection horizon. GW observations will make it possible to detect the complete population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts of $z \simeq 100$. This capability will deliver an unprecedented map of merger events across cosmic time and enable precise reconstruction of their mass and spin distributions, while for several thousand events the signal-to-noise ratio will surpass 100, enabling precision physics of BHs and neutron stars (NSs). The access to lower frequencies will also open the intermediate-mass window, detecting systems of order $\sim 10^3 M_\odot$, potentially in coordination with multi-band observations from LISA. At higher redshifts, where Population III stars have so far remained beyond reach - even for the James Webb Space Telescope - GW observations by next-generation detectors will routinely provide observations of BH mergers thought to originate from these primordial stellar populations. Such measurements are expected to play a central role in clarifying the early assembly of supermassive black holes. A single detection of a binary BH system at $z \gtrsim 30$, or of a compact object with sub-solar mass and no tidal deformability, would constitute strong evidence for the existence of primordial black holes. Such a discovery would have profound consequences for our understanding of dark matter and the early Universe. Ultimately, the GW observations will become revolutionary for identifying the physical channels responsible for compact binary formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Ly$\alpha$ blobs (LABs) are large, spatially extended Ly$\alpha$-emitting objects whose nature remains unclear. Their statistical properties such as number densities and luminosity functions are still uncertain because of small sample sizes and large cosmic variance. The One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey, with its large volume, offers an opportunity to overcome these limitations. We describe our LAB selection method and present 112 new LABs in the 9 deg$^2$ E-COSMOS field. We begin with the conventional LAB selection approach, cross-matching LAEs with extended Ly$\alpha$ sources, yielding 89 LAB candidates. To obtain a more complete LAB sample, we introduce a new selection pipeline that models all galaxies detected in deep broadband imaging, subtracts them from the narrowband image, and then directly detects extended Ly$\alpha$ emission. This method successfully identifies 23 additional low-surface-brightness LABs which could otherwise be missed by the conventional method. The number density of ODIN LABs near an ODIN protocluster ($n=7.5\times10^{-5}$ cMpc$^{-3}$) is comparable to that found in the SSA22 proto-cluster and is four times higher than the average across the field. The cumulative Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function within the protocluster regions is similar to that measured for the LABs in the SSA22 proto-cluster, suggesting a large excess of luminous LABs relative to the average field. These findings suggest the Ly$\alpha$ luminosities and number densities of LABs are environment-dependent. ODIN will provide an expansive LAB and protocluster samples across six additional fields and two more redshifts, allowing us to investigate the nature of LABs in relation to their environments.
#### Constraining black hole spin in PG 1535+547 amidst complex multi-layered absorption

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectroscopic analysis of XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of the 'complex' NLS1 PG 1535+547 at redshift $z=0.038$. These observations span three epochs: 2002 and 2006 with XMM-Newton alone, covering the $0.3-10$ keV energy range, and a coordinated XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observation in 2016, covering the $0.3-60$ keV energy range. The X-ray spectra across all epochs exhibit both neutral and ionized absorption, along with reflection features from the accretion disc, including a prominent Compton hump in the broadband data. Notably, the spectral shape varies across epochs. Our analysis suggests this variability is attributed to changes in both line-of-sight absorption and the intrinsic emission from PG 1535+547. The source is obscured by multiple layers of partially and/or fully covering neutral and ionized absorbers, with neutral column densities ranging from undetectable levels in the least obscured phase to $\sim0.3-5\times10^{23}\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ in the most obscured phase. A clear warm absorber is revealed during the least obscured phase. The continuum remains fairly consistent ($\Gamma\approx 2.2\pm0.1$) during the first two observations, followed by a substantial flux decrease (by a factor of $\sim7$ in the $2-10$ keV band) in 2016 compared to 2006. The 2016 data indicates the source is in a reflection-dominated state during this epoch, with a reflection fraction of $R>7$ and an X-ray source located at a height $\leq 1.72r_g$. Simultaneous fitting of the multi-epoch data suggests a rapidly rotating black hole with a spin parameter, $a>0.99$. These findings imply that strong light-bending effects may account for the observed continuum flux reduction.
#### Across the Universe: GW231123 as a magnified and diffracted black hole merger

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17631

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123 appears as the most massive binary black hole (BBH) ever observed by the LIGO interferometers with total mass $190-265 M_\odot$. A high observed mass can be explained by the combination of cosmological redshift and gravitational magnification if the source is aligned with a gravitational lens, such as a galaxy. Small-scale objects such as stars and remnants diffract the signal, distorting the wavefront and providing additional lensing signatures. Here we present an analysis of GW231123 combining for the first time the effects of diffraction by a small-scale lens and gravitational magnification by an external potential, modelled as an embedded point-mass lens (PL), finding an intriguing case for the lensing hypothesis. Lensing is favoured by the data, with a false alarm probability of the observed Bayes factors bounded below $<1\%$, or $\sim 2.6 \sigma$ confidence level. Including lensing lowers the total source mass of GW231123 to $100-180 M_\odot$, closer to BBHs reported so far, and also removes discrepancies between different waveform approximants and the need for high component spins. We reconstruct all source and lens properties, including the microlens mass $190-850 M_\odot$, its offset, the magnitude of the external gravitational potential and its orientation. The embedded PL analysis leads to a lighter microlens compared to the isolated PL. Within our assumptions, the reconstruction is complete up to an ambiguity between the distance and projected density (mass-sheet degeneracy). Assuming a single galaxy as the macroscopic lens allows us to infer the total amplification of the signal, placing the event at redshift $0.7-2$, and predict the probability $~55\%$ of forming an additional detectable image due to strong lensing by the macrolens. We discuss the implications of our findings on the source and nature of the microlens, including a possible dark matter origin.
#### Interpreting the strong clustering of ultra-diffuse galaxies by halo spin bias

 - **Abstract**
 We use the IllustrisTNG300-ODM simulation to investigate the spin bias of low-mass halos and its connection to the strong clustering of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) reported by Zhang et al. (2025). By comparing two halo spin definitions-one using only bound particles ($\lambda_{\rm b}$) and another including unbound particles ($\lambda_{\rm a}$)-we demonstrate that the spin bias of low-mass halos critically depends on the definition. While $\lambda_{\rm a}$ yields stronger clustering for higher-spin halos at all masses, $\lambda_{\rm b}$ produces an inverted trend below $M_{\rm h}\sim 10^{11} \rm M_{\odot}/h$. This discrepancy is driven by a subset of halos in high-density environments that have large $\lambda_{\rm a}$ but small $\lambda_{\rm b}$. Using an empirical model implemented in SDSS-like mocks, we link the stellar surface-mass-density ($\Sigma_\ast$) of a galaxy to $\lambda_{\rm a}$ of its host halo and find an anti-correlation that more diffuse dwarfs tend to reside in higher-spin halos. The model naturally reproduces the observed strong clustering of UDGs within the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework without invoking exotic assumptions such as self-interacting dark matter. The high fraction of unbound particles in UDG hosts likely originates from tidal fields in dense regions, an effect particularly significant for low-mass halos. We discuss how the angular momentum of a halo represented by $\lambda_{\rm a}$ may be transferred to the gas to affect size and surface density of the galaxy that forms in the halo.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields are critical at many scales to galactic dynamics and structure, including multiphase pressure balance, dust processing, and star formation. Dynamo action determines their dynamical structure and strength. Simulations of combined large- and small-scale dynamos have successfully developed mean fields with strength and topology consistent with observations but with turbulent fields much weaker than observed, while simulations of small-scale dynamos with parameters relevant to the interstellar medium yield turbulent fields an order of magnitude below the values observed or expected theoretically. We use the Pencil Code accelerated on GPUs with Astaroth to perform high-resolution simulations of a supernova-driven galactic dynamo including heating and cooling in a periodic domain. Our models show that the strength of the turbulent field produced by the small-scale dynamo approaches an asymptote at only modest magnetic Prandtl numbers. This allows us to use these models to suggest the essential characteristics of this constituent of the magnetic field for inclusion in global galactic models. The asymptotic limit occurs already at magnetic Prandtl number of only a few hundred, many orders of magnitude below physical values in the the interstellar medium and consistent with previous findings for isothermal compressible flows.
