 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission is widely used to trace the distribution of molecular gas in the interstellar medium (ISM), exhibiting a tight correlation with CO(2-1) emission across nearby galaxies. Using PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-ALMA data, we identify localized regions where this correlation fails, with CO flux exceeding that predicted from 7.7$\mu$m PAH emission by more than an order of magnitude. These outlier regions are found in 20 out of 70 galaxies and are mostly located in galaxy centers and bars, without signs of massive star formation. We explore two scenarios to explain the elevated CO-to-PAH ratios, which can either be due to suppressed PAH emission or enhanced CO emissivity. We examine PAH emission in other bands (3.3$\mu$m and 11.3$\mu$m) and the dust continuum dominated bands (10$\mu$m and 21$\mu$m), finding consistently high CO-to-PAH (or CO-to-dust continuum) emission ratios, suggesting that 7.7$\mu$m PAH emission is not particularly suppressed. In some outlier regions, PAH size distributions and spectral energy distribution of the illuminating radiation differ slightly compared to nearby control regions with normal CO-to-PAH ratios, though without a consistent trend. We find that the outlier regions generally show higher CO velocity dispersions ($\Delta v_{\mathrm{CO}}$). This increase in $\Delta v_{\mathrm{CO}}$ may lower CO optical depth and raise its emissivity for a given gas mass. Our results favor a scenario where shear along the bar lanes and shocks at the tips of the bar elevate CO emissivity, leading to the breakdown of the CO-PAH correlation.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) drive powerful, multiphase outflows that are thought to play a key role in galaxy evolution. The hot, shocked phase of these outflows ($T \gtrsim 10^{6} \rm{\ K}$) is expected to dominate the energy content, but is challenging to observe due to its long cooling time and low emissivity. The cool phase ($T \lesssim 10^{4} \rm{\ K}$) is easier to detect observationally, but it traces a less energetic outflow component. In prior simulations of the interaction between an energy-driven AGN outflow and a clumpy ISM, we found that mixing between hot wind and cool ISM clouds produces a new, highly radiative, phase at $T \approx 10^{6-7} \rm{\ K}$ which fuels the formation of a long-lived ($\geq 5\ \rm{Myr}$) cool outflow. We investigate the X-ray emission generated by thermal Bremsstrahlung and high-ionisation metal line emission in this mixing phase, finding that it could contribute significantly to the X-ray output of the outflow. This mixing-induced X-ray emission is strongest in the part of the outflow propagating equatorially through the disc, and is extended on scales of $D\simeq 3-4\ \rm{kpc}$. For quasar luminosities of $L_{\rm{AGN}}\simeq 10^{45-46}\rm{\ erg\ s^{-1}}$, the resulting X-ray luminosity is equivalent to that expected from star formation rates $\rm{SFR}\simeq 10-200\ \rm{M_\odot\ yr^{-1}}$, showing that it could be an important source of soft X-rays in AGN host galaxies. Our results suggest that this extended emission could be resolvable in local quasars ($z\lesssim 0.11$) using high spatial-resolution X-ray observatories such as Chandra, or proposed missions such as AXIS and Lynx.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the VST-COSMOS survey to identify, via their optical broadband variability, 30 AGN in nearby (z<0.4) dwarf (10^8 MSun < M < 10^10 MSun) galaxies. VST-COSMOS offers a 1 deg^2 survey footprint, a single visit depth of 24.6 mag and 68 r-band visits spanning an eleven-year temporal baseline. Compared to a control sample matched in stellar mass and redshift, the dwarf AGN population shows an elevated fraction of early-type galaxies but a similar fraction of interacting objects, suggesting that interactions do not play a significant role in triggering these AGN. Dwarf AGN hosts do not show strong differences in their distances to nodes, filaments and massive galaxies compared to the controls, which indicates that AGN triggering, at least in this sample, is not strongly correlated with environment. Finally, by combining the true number of galaxies, the detectability of AGN and the measured numbers of variable sources in dwarf and massive (M > 10^10 MSun) galaxies, we estimate the relative frequency of AGN in these two mass regimes. Our results suggest that the incidence of AGN in dwarfs and massive galaxies is similar (within less than a factor of 2 of each other), with some evidence that the AGN fraction increases with stellar mass in the dwarf population.

 - **Abstract**
 As galaxies evolve in dense cluster and protocluster environments, they interact and quench their star formation, which gradually transforms the galaxy population from star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies. This transformation is identifiable by observing galaxy colors and can be seen in the morphological transformation of late-type galaxies into early-type galaxies, which creates the morphology-density relation seen when comparing populations in clusters to co-eval field galaxies. However, high-z (z > 2) galaxy morphology studies are hindered by the high angular resolution necessary to characterize morphology. We present a study of HST WFC3 F160W observations of protoclusters from the MAMMOTH survey (BOSS1244 and BOSS1542) at z ~ 2.23 with populations of previously identified HAEs. By measuring the Sersic index of 151 HAEs, we look for the early morphological transformation of star-forming galaxies in these well-studied, large, non-virialized protoclusters, which we believe are precursors of present-day clusters. We find the morphology of the populations of star-forming protocluster galaxies does not differ from the co-eval field. However, we identify a population of clumpy, potentially merging galaxies, which could lead to an increase in the population of early-type galaxies in these structures. Additionally, in BOSS1244, which has two previously identified massive quiescent galaxies including a BCG, we find an abundance of early-type galaxies near both the BCG and two co-eval high-z quasars. Although we find a strong similarity between the morphology of field and protocluster galaxies, the population of early-type star-forming galaxies surrounding the spectroscopically confirmed quiescent BCG in BOSS1244, something not seen in BOSS1542, may point to differences in the evolutionary state of these co-eval protoclusters and be a sign of an early forming cluster core in BOSS1244.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce J-HERTz (J-PLUS Heritage Exploration of Radio Targets at $z < 5$), a new multi-wavelength catalog that combines optical narrow-band photometry from J-PLUS, infrared observations from WISE, and deep low-frequency radio data from LoTSS for nearly half a million sources across 2,100 deg$^2$ of the northern sky. Key innovations of J-HERTz include Bayesian neural network classifications for 390,000 galaxies, 31,000 quasars, and 20,000 stars, along with significantly improved photometric redshifts for 235,000 galaxies compared to previous J-PLUS DR3 and LoTSS DR2 estimates. We identify 831 candidate Galactic radio stars, which, if confirmed, would constitute a significant addition to the number of radio-emitting stars identified to date. Among radio-loud galaxies with spectroscopic observations, $\gtrsim$20% lack Seyfert or LINER signatures, indicating a substantial population of optically quiescent radio galaxies, in agreement with previous works. Spectral energy distribution fitting of their host galaxies using J-PLUS photospectra reveals systematically low specific star formation rates, consistent with quenched stellar populations. J-HERTz thus provides a powerful dataset to exploit radio-optical synergies, enabling studies that span from the origin of stellar radio emission to the AGN life cycle and the role of jet activity in shaping host galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST/MIRI observations can place photometric limits on the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) near the Galactic Centre. The stellar complex IRS 13E, a co-moving conglomerate of young and massive stars, is a prime location to study because it has been speculated to be bound by an IMBH. Assuming a standard radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and a minimum fractional variability of 10% of intrinsic luminosity, the wavelength of peak emission in the spectral energy distribution for an IMBH would lie in the mid-infrared ($\sim$ 5-25 $\mu$m), and variability would be detectable in MIRI time-series observations. Monitoring fails to detect such variable emission (other than from Sgr A*) in and around the IRS 13E complex, and upper limits on a putative IMBH's intrinsic variability on timescales of minutes to about 1 hour are $\lesssim$1 mJy at 12 $\mu$m and $\lesssim$2 mJy at 19 $\mu$m. These translate to luminosities $\lesssim 25 \times 10^{32}$ erg/s. The resulting limits on the IMBH mass and accretion rate rule out any IMBH with mass $\gtrsim 10^3$ M$_\odot$ accreting at $\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ times Eddington rate at the location of IRS 13E. Further, the observations rule out an IMBH anywhere in the central 6" $\times$ 6" region that is more massive than $\approx$ 2 $\times 10^3$ M$_\odot$ and accreting at $\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ of the Eddington rate. Assuming Bondi accretion scaled to typical RIAF-accretion efficiencies, albeit somewhat uncertain, also allows us to rule out IMBHs moving with typical velocities of about 200 km/s and masses $\gtrsim 2 \times 10^3$ M$_\odot$. These methods showcase the effectiveness of photometric variability measurements in constraining the presence of accreting black holes in Galactic centre-like environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeating soft X-ray flares associated with galactic nuclei. Several recent works have found evidence that the accretion flow in the galactic nuclei of QPEs is of recent origin, and that it is unlike canonical active galactic nuclei (AGN). A precursor tidal disruption event has been observed in a few cases. In this work we report new radio observations of the QPE host galaxy RXJ\,1301.9+2747 taken at 5.0\,GHz with the High Sensitivity Array (HSA), to complement archival 1.7\,GHz observations reported previously. Our new observations confirm the presence of a highly compact radio source in RXJ\,1301.9+2747, which is smaller than $0.9\times0.4~\mathrm{pc}$ at 5.0\,GHz. The nonsimultaneous very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) compact flux of the source is consistent with a negative spectral index, and thus is similar to the larger non-VLBI scale radio spectral index. Contrary to earlier results at 1.7\,GHz, we find the 5\,GHz emission offset from the optical Gaia position, which may be due to dust extinction in the host galaxy. In addition, there is a significant offset between the 1.7 and 5.0\,GHz data, which may result from astrophysical uncertainties in the calibration source. This sheds new light on the elusive properties of the radio-detected QPE sources. Consistent with previous results, our observations disfavor a star formation or jet-core-region origin of the radio emission. We cannot rule out a reconnection-driven scenario for the radio emission, but we favor a remnant jet or outflow scenario. This is overall in agreement with the radio properties of radio-detected QPE sources at lower angular resolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are some of the brightest explosions in the Universe representing the extremes of stellar deaths. At the upper end of their distribution is SN\,2023taz, one of the most luminous SLSNe discovered to date with a peak absolute magnitude of $M_{g,\rm{peak}}=-22.75 \pm 0.03$ and a lower limit for energy radiated of $E=2.9 \times 10^{51}$\,erg. Magnetar model fits reveal individual parameter values typical of the SLSN population, but the combination of a low $B$-field and ejecta mass with a short spin period places SN\,2023taz in a unusual region of parameter space, accounting for its extreme luminosity. The optical data around peak are consistent with a temperature of $\sim$17\,000\,K but SN\,2023taz shows a surprising deficit in the UV compared to other events in this temperature range. We find no indication of dust extinction that could plausibly explain the UV deficit. The lower level of UV flux is reminiscent of the absorption seen in lower-luminosity events like SN\,2017dwh, where Fe-group elements are responsible for the effect. However, in the case of SN\,2023taz, there is no evidence for a larger amount of Fe-group elements which could contribute to line blanketing. Comparing to SLSNe with well-observed UV spectra, an underlying temperature of $8000-9000$\,K would match the UV spectral slope, but is not consistent with the optical colour temperatures of these events. The most likely explanation is enhanced absorption by intermediate-mass elements, challenging previous findings that SLSNe exhibit similar UV absorption line equivalent widths. This highlights the need for expanded UV spectroscopic coverage of SLSNe, especially at early times, to build a framework for interpreting their diversity and to enable classification at higher redshifts where optical observations will exclusively probe rest-frame UV emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations aimed at identifying potential jet-ISM interaction sites in the vicinity of the transient black hole X-ray binaries MAXI J1348-630 and MAXI J1820+070, both of which have recently undergone an outburst, and displayed powerful large scale jets. Using this dataset, we construct molecular line emission maps. By analyzing the morphological, spectral, and kinematic properties of the detected emission, we identify a molecular structure that provides compelling evidence for a jet-driven cavity in the local environment of MAXI J1348-630 but find no significant emission in the local environment of MAXI J1820+070. We use the properties of the detected molecular emission surrounding MAXI J1348-630 to constrain the jet power, finding our results to be consistent with other independent studies of this source, and further validating the utility of astrochemistry for constraining jet energetics. Additionally, our findings provide the first assessment on the formation timescales for jet-ISM interaction regions in the transient black hole X-ray binary population.

 - **Abstract**
 Open clusters (OCs) act as key probes that can be leveraged to constrain the formation and evolution of the Milky Way (MW)'s disk, as each has a unique chemical fingerprint and well-constrained age. Significant Galactic dynamic interactions can leave imprints on the orbital properties of OCs, allowing us to use the present day properties of long-lived OCs to reconstruct the MW's dynamic history. To explore these changes, we identify OC analogs in FIRE-2 simulations of MW-mass galaxies. For this work, we focus on one particular FIRE-2 OC, which we identify as an analog to the old, subsolar, distant, and high Galactic latitude MW OC, Berkeley 20. Our simulated OC resides ~6 kpc from the galactic center and ultimately reaches a height $|Z_{\mathrm{max}}|>2$ kpc from the galactic disk, similar to Berkeley 20. We trace the simulated cluster's orbital and environmental history, identifying key perturbative episodes, including: (1) an interaction with a gas overdensity in a spiral arm that prompts an outward migration event and (2) a substantial interaction with a Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy-mass satellite that causes significant orbital modification. Our simulated OC shows significant resilience to disruption during both its outward migration and the satellite-driven heating event that causes subsequent inward migration. Ultimately, we find these two key processes -- migration and satellite heating -- are essential to include when assessing OC orbital dynamics in the era of Gaia.

 - **Abstract**
 As we enter the era of large imaging surveys such as $\textit{Roman}$, Rubin, and $\textit{Euclid}$, a deeper understanding of potential biases and selection effects in optical astronomical catalogs created with the use of ML-based methods is paramount. This work focuses on a deeper understanding of the performance and limitations of deep learning-based classifiers as tools for galaxy merger identification. We train a ResNet18 model on mock Hubble Space Telescope CANDELS images from the IllustrisTNG50 simulation. Our focus is on a more challenging classification of galaxy mergers and nonmergers at higher redshifts $1<z<1.5$, including minor mergers and lower mass galaxies down to the stellar mass of $10^8 M_\odot$. We demonstrate, for the first time, that a deep learning model, such as the one developed in this work, can successfully identify even minor and low mass mergers even at these redshifts. Our model achieves overall accuracy, purity, and completeness of 73%. We show that some galaxy mergers can only be identified from certain observation angles, leading to a potential upper limit in overall accuracy. Using Grad-CAMs and UMAPs, we more deeply examine the performance and observe a visible gradient in the latent space with stellar mass and specific star formation rate, but no visible gradient with merger mass ratio or merger stage.
#### The ALMA-QUARKS survey: Evidence of a candidate high-mass prestellar core aside a bright-rimmed cloud IRAS 18290-0924

 - **Abstract**
 Although frequently reported in observations, the definitive confirmation of high-mass prestellar cores has remained elusive, presenting a persistent challenge in star formation studies. Using two-band observational data from the 3mm ATOMS and 1.3mm QUARKS surveys, we report a high-mass prestellar core candidate, C2, located on the side of the bright-rimmed cloud IRAS 18290-0924. The C2 core identified from the 3mm continuum data of the ATOMS survey ($\sim$2 arcsecond, $\rm\sim 10000~au$ at 5.3 kpc) has a mass ranging from 27-68 $M_{\odot}$ for temperatures 10-22K within a radius of $\sim$2800 au. The highest-resolution ($\sim$0.3 arcsecond, $\rm\sim 1500 au$) observations of this source presented to date from the QUARKS survey reveal no evidence of further fragmentation. Further analysis of a total $\sim$10 GHz band width of molecular line survey does not find star-formation activity (e.g., outflows, ionized gas) associated with the core, with a few molecular lines of cold gas detected only. Additionally, virial analysis indicates the C2 core is gravitationally bound ($\alpha_{\rm vir} \sim0.1-0.3$) and thus could be undergoing collapse toward star formation. These results strongly establish a candidate for a high-mass prestellar core, contributing to the very limited number of such sources known to date.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia space telescope has transformed our understanding of random stellar encounters with the Solar System. This study examines how such perturbations influence the most eccentric comets in the Oort Cloud (OC), a thermalized reservoir of $\sim 10^{12}$ icy bodies extending from $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ AU. Recent Gaia-based analyses indicate about 20 stellar passages within 1 pc of the Sun per Myr. Using analytical estimates and direct $N$-body simulations, we quantify how these encounters modify highly eccentric orbits: individual flybys enhance comet-shower rates by factors of about 2, producing a cumulative increase of roughly 40 over a Myr. In parallel, we perform a full dynamical search through all stars with six-dimensional phase-space data in Gaia DR3 and identify a compelling candidate for a long-period stellar companion to the Sun. This star exhibits recurrent $\sim 45$ Myr perihelion passages and, in simulations, can elevate comet-shower activity by an order of magnitude. Because a perturber of this kind could also be a dispersed solar sibling, the companion hypothesis links the dynamical structure of the OC directly to the long-standing problem of identifying the Sun's birth-cluster relatives. The chemical-abundance pattern of such a star therefore becomes a critical observational test. Together, these results clarify how both stochastic encounters and potential long-period companions shape the dynamical evolution and observable output of the outermost OC, while highlighting the possibility that the OC retains a dynamical memory of the Sun's earliest stellar environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Crust-superfluid coupling plays an important role in neutron star rotation, particularly with respect to timing noise and glitches. Here, we present new timing-noise-based estimates of the crust-superfluid coupling time-scale \(\tau\) for 105 radio pulsars in the UTMOST dataset, by Kalman filtering the pulse times of arrival. The 105 objects are selected because they favor a two-component, crust-superfluid model over a one-component model with log Bayes factor \(\ln \mathfrak{B}_{\rm BF} \geq 5\). The median estimate of \(\tau\) ranges from \(10^{4.6\pm0.4}\)\,s for PSR J2241$-$5236 to \(10^{7.7^{+0.7}_{-0.4}}\)\,s for PSR J1644$-$4559 among 28 out of 105 objects with sharply peaked \(\tau\) posteriors. A hierarchical Bayesian analysis is performed on 101 out of 105 objects that are canonical (i.e.\ neither recycled nor magnetars) and reside in the populous core of the \(\Omega_{\rm c}\)-\(\dot{\Omega}_{\rm c}\) plane. It returns the population-level scaling \(\tau \propto \Omega_{\rm c}^{0.19^{+0.50}_{-0.52}} |\dot{\Omega}_{\rm c}|^{0.18^{+0.18}_{-0.19}}\), where \(\Omega_{\rm c}\) and \(\dot{\Omega}_{\rm c}\) are the angular velocity and spin-down rate of the crust respectively. The variances of the stochastic crust and superfluid torques are also estimated hierarchically, with \(Q_{\rm c} \propto \Omega_{\rm c}^{1.23^{+0.80}_{-0.75}} |\dot{\Omega}_{\rm c}|^{0.49^{+0.27}_{-0.32}}\) and \(Q_{\rm s} \propto \Omega_{\rm c}^{0.71^{+0.76}_{-0.78}} |\dot{\Omega}_{\rm c}|^{1.27^{+0.30}_{-0.28}}\) respectively. Implications for the physical origin of crust-superfluid coupling, e.g.\ through mutual friction, are discussed briefly.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic braking can drive angular momentum loss in star formation and influence disk evolution. A previous study of HH 111 VLA1 suggested a decrease in rotation velocity in a region between the infalling envelope and rotating disk. Using ALMA C$^{18}$O ($J = 2-1$) data, we analyzed the gas motion within 6000 au and found clear deviations from the simplest expectations of free-fall towards the central star with conserved angular momentum in the transition region between the envelope and disk (from $\sim$5200 to 160 au). The region can be further divided into three zones: (1) outer region with a significant decrease in infall velocity, dropping to approximately 60\% of the free-fall velocity and 70\% of conservation of angular momentum and energy; (2) middle region with a sharp drop in angular momentum and thus rotation velocity and an increase in infall velocity; and (3) inner region with rotation velocity increasing inward to connect to that of the Keplerian disk and infall velocity decreasing to zero. Comparison with non-ideal MHD simulations suggests that the reduced infall velocity in the outer region can be due to magnetic tension by the pinched magnetic field lines, the sharp drop of angular momentum in the middle region can be due to magnetic braking as the field lines pile up, and the rapid increase in rotation velocity in the inner region might result from weaker magnetic braking due to ambipolar diffusion of the field lines. The resulting dip in the rotation profile supports magnetic braking.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous observations of Titan, Pluto and Solar System gas giants along with recent observations of exoplanet atmospheres with the James Webb Space Telescope taught us that photochemical hazes are ubiquitous and form in a variety of temperature, gas composition and irradiation environments. Despite being crucial to understand their impact on observations and on the planetary radiative budget, the refractive indices of these haze particles are unknown and strongly influenced by changes in the gas phase chemistry. In this study, we perform a cross-laboratory investigation to assess the effect of the experimental set-up and gas composition on the refractive indices of Titan, Pluto and exoplanet haze analogs. We report new data in a broad spectral range from UV to far-IR (up to 200 microns) for future use in climate models and retrieval frameworks.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the transfer of mass and angular momentum in binary interactions is crucial for modelling the evolution of any interacting binary after the first mass transfer phase. We constrain the efficiency and stability of thermal timescale mass transfer in massive binary evolution using the observed population of massive interacting binaries on the Main Sequence (`Algols') in the Milky Way, Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Assuming the present-day mass of the donor star represents its initial convective core mass at Zero-Age Main Sequence, we estimate its initial mass using detailed stellar evolution models. From the initial donor mass, we calculate the range of initial accretor masses (for different mass transfer efficiencies). By imposing physical constraints on the above initial parameter ranges, we derive the mass transfer efficiency, stability and angular momentum loss that can reproduce the current properties of each Algol binary. We find that purely conservative or non-conservative mass transfer cannot explain the current mass ratio and orbital period of all massive Algols. Angular momentum conservation rules out conservative mass transfer in $\sim$28\,\% of massive Algols in the SMC. About three-quarters of all massive Algols are consistent with having undergone inefficient mass transfer ($\lesssim$\,50\,\%), while the remaining systems, mostly residing in the LMC and Milky Way, require mass transfer to have been more efficient than 25\%. The current sample of massive Algols does not require mass transfer to be efficient at the shortest orbital periods (2\,d) at any metallicity. We find evidence that mass transfer on the Main Sequence needs to be stable for initial accretor-to-donor mass ratios as unequal as $\sim 0.6$. The massive Algols in the SMC seem to have undergone less efficient mass transfer than those in the LMC and Milky Way. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 We present an efficient estimator for higher-order galaxy clustering using small groups of nearby galaxies, or multiplets. Using the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2, we identify galaxy multiplets as discrete objects and measure their cross-correlations with the general galaxy field. Our results show that the multiplets exhibit stronger clustering bias as they trace more massive dark matter halos than individual galaxies. When comparing the observed clustering statistics with the mock catalogs generated from the N-body simulation AbacusSummit, we find that the mocks underpredict multiplet clustering despite reproducing the galaxy two-point auto-correlation reasonably well. This discrepancy indicates that the standard Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model is insufficient to describe the properties of galaxy multiplets, revealing the greater constraining power of this higher-order statistic on galaxy-halo connection and the possibility that multiplets are specific to additional assembly bias. We demonstrate that incorporating secondary biases into the HOD model improves agreement with the observed multiplet statistics, specifically by allowing galaxies to preferentially occupy halos in denser environments. Our results highlight the potential of utilizing multiplet clustering, beyond traditional two-point correlation measurements, to break degeneracies in models describing the galaxy-dark matter connection.

 - **Abstract**
 The tight empirical $M-\sigma$ relation between the mass of a SMBH) and the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy bulge is often interpreted as the result of self-regulation by AGN feedback. This picture is motivated by analytical and semi-analytical models in which momentum-driven AGN winds can expel the gas once the SMBH reaches a critical mass. However, these models typically assume idealised conditions: smooth gas distributions, spherical symmetry, and very efficient cooling of the shocked AGN wind. We checked whether AGN outflows can establish the $M-\sigma$ relation in a multi-phase and turbulent galactic bulge subject to realistic radiative cooling while conserving the shocked AGN wind energy. We calculated a suite of purpose-built hydrodynamical simulations of AGN outflows in turbulent gas shells, covering a wide range of constant AGN luminosities. We tracked the outflow evolution over the course of $\geq1$~Myr. We analysed the effect of AGN outflow on the cold dense gas and SMBH feeding, estimating the luminosity threshold for removing most of the cold gas from the central regions. We find that AGNs with significantly sub-Eddington luminosities cannot suppress SMBH feeding, while luminosities exceeding $\sim 0.7$ times Eddington clear out both the diffuse hot gas and the cold clumps, consistent with the momentum-driven outflow formalism. We also show that dense gas clusters are affected almost exclusively by the AGN wind momentum, while the shocked wind energy escapes through low-density channels and inflates large bubbles of diffuse gas. Therefore, AGN wind-driven energy-conserving feedback in a turbulent multi-phase medium affects the dense gas only via the wind momentum. Thus, the momentum-driven outflow paradigm is applicable for explaining the $M-\sigma$ relation even in realistic systems.

 - **Abstract**
 This work explored the spatial distribution of C$^{17}$O, SiO, HC$_{3}$N and SO$_{2}$ molecules, as well as the energetics of outflows in G358.46$-$0.39 proto-cluster using ALMA band 7 archival data, with the aim of providing an improved understanding of its protostellar nature, gas kinematics and dynamics. G358.46$-$0.39 is previously known to consist of 4 dust continuum cores (MM1a, MM1b, MM1c and MM2). The integrated intensity map of C$^{17}$O reveals filamentary and dumbbell-shaped structures that are probably compressed gases from the expansion of the HII region MM2. The SiO emission reveals spatially overlapped blue and red outflow lobes, likely driven by an unresolved young stellar object (YSO) in MM1a. The spatial distribution of HC$_{3}$N and SO$_{2}$ molecules in MM1a shows a compact morphology, with no detectable HC$_{3}$N and SO$_{2}$ emissions in the other cores. The SO$_{2}$ emission reveals a clear velocity gradient in MM1a, as well as large velocity dispersion ($\sim$ 3\,\kms) within the inner core of MM1a, which are consistent with rotating structures. We estimated the mass, momentum and energy outflow rate, as well as other outflow parameters. The SiO outflow exhibits a different morphology compared to the $^{12}$CO outflow morphology previously observed in MM1a. The SiO and $^{12}$CO outflows are probably associated with disks of separate cores with one face-on and the other edge-on, pointing to multiplicity of YSOs in MM1a. The properties of MM1a indicate that it is a massive protostar that is actively accreting and undergoing star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic analysis of transient astrophysical events -- including supernovae (SNe), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and fast radio bursts (FRBs) -- in void and non-void galaxies within the local universe ($0.005 < z < 0.05$). Cosmic voids, defined by low galaxy densities and characterized by minimal environmental interactions, offer a natural laboratory for isolating the impact of large-scale underdensities on stellar evolution and transient production. Using multi-wavelength data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Supernova Catalogue, and high-energy space observatories, we compare transient occurrence rates and host galaxy properties across environments. We find that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are significantly more common in void galaxies, indicating that massive star formation remains active in underdense regions. In contrast, Type Ia supernovae are less frequent in voids, consistent with a scarcity of older stellar populations. Notably, we identify a short-duration GRB hosted by a void galaxy, demonstrating that compact object mergers can occur in isolated environments. Additionally, we find no FRBs associated with void galaxies. Taken together, these results show that cosmic voids exert a measurable influence on the star formation history of galaxies and hence on the production of transients.

 - **Abstract**
 We present radial trends of metallicity ([Fe/H]) and abundance ratios ([X/Fe]) for several chemical elements -- including C, N, Na, and the so-called alpha-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti) -- in the bulge of M31, out to ~0.6kpc from the center. We estimated abundances using full-spectrum fitting, full-index fitting, and line-strength analysis, in combination with different stellar population models. We first tested these techniques on mock spectra and SDSS stacked spectra of ETGs, and then applied them to high-quality long-slit spectroscopy of the M31 bulge obtained with the OSIRIS spectrograph at the GTC. We find that O, N, and Na are significantly enhanced relative to Fe across the bulge, with typical abundances >0.3~dex. In particular, N and Na show steep central enhancements, reaching ~0.5dex. C, Mg, and Si exhibit intermediate enhancements of [X/Fe]~0.2dex, with C and Mg decreasing toward the center to <~0.1dex; while Ca, and to a lesser extent Ti, closely follow Fe, with [X/Fe]<0.1dex. Applying the same analysis to SDSS stacked spectra of ETGs revealed that the abundance pattern of the M31 bulge closely resembles that of the most massive galaxies, except for N, which is significantly more enhanced (by ~0.1dex) in the bulge. For the bulk of the bulge, chemical evolution models assuming high star-formation efficiency and a short gas infall timescale reproduce the overall trends in [Fe/H] and [X/Fe]. In the central region (<~100pc), the high metallicity content of the bulge can be explained by either an IMF flatter than Salpeter at high mass, or a prolonged star formation. Additional processes, such as differential galactic winds, appear necessary to account for the observed decoupling among alpha elements and the strong central N enhancement. Our results support a scenario whereby the bulk of the M31 bulge formed during a fast and intense episode of star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The $21\,$cm signal originating from Cosmic Dawn to the Epoch of Reionisation is highly sensitive to the processes governing star formation in the early universe as well as new physics. In this work, we focus on the imprint of non-cold dark matter (DM), which impacts the formation of the smallest halos. Our goal in particular is to clarify whether near-future radio telescopes such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA), will be able to distinguish between free-streaming dark matter, specifically in the form of thermal warm DM (WDM), and collisional damping due to neutrino-DM ($\nu$DM) interactions giving rise to larger overdensities on small scales. For that purpose we first implement a mapping between the two models in terms of a cutoff scale and determine detection thresholds for the two DM models. Using Fisher matrix forecasts, we show that $\nu$DM interaction strengths down to $\sigma_{\nu{\rm DM}}\sim 3\times10^{-35}$ cm$^2$ could be probed by $21\,$cm cosmology when considering two populations of galaxies for a GeV mass DM. This would allow to either confirm or rule out a recent claimed preference for a non-zero $\nu$DM interaction in Lyman-$\alpha$ data. Furthermore, we find that HERA will not be able to distinguish between $\nu$DM and WDM. In the latter context, the threshold for detection of $\nu$DM interactions translates into WDM with mass up to $m_{\rm WDM}\sim 9$ keV that could be detected by HERA.

 - **Abstract**
 The Circinus galaxy is the nearest type-2 Seyfert galaxy, which is at a distance of 4.2 Mpc. Its environment is challenging to explore because it is located at low Galactic latitudes, behind the Galactic disc. The long-term goal is to characterise the Circinus galaxy halo and determine the presence of dwarf satellites using near-infrared data. We selected 1,542 galaxies from the VVV NIRGC within a 2-degree radius around Circinus, representing 2/3 of the virial radius. Structural parameters such as half-light radii and colours were used, and correlations were examined. A neural network was trained with 486 galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts to estimate photometric redshifts for all galaxies. Potential satellites were defined based on half-light radii compatible with the typical sizes of dwarf satellites, and combined with photometric redshifts. The galaxy properties are reliably characterised down to $K_{s}$ $\sim$ 15.5 mag, which represents about 90% completeness of detections. At the distance of Circinus, this limiting magnitude corresponds to $K_{s}$ absolute magnitude of $-12.6$ mag, which allows us to find dwarf galaxies. There are 20 galaxies with half-light radii larger than 2.45 arcsec, only 8 have photometric redshifts below 0.04. None of these galaxies is close to Circinus, which has a redshift of 0.0015. The ANNz model exhibited a high degree of accuracy in the range $0.001 < z_{phot} < 0.023$. The presence of dwarf satellites could not be confirmed with the available data in the studied region. The apparent lack of satellites may be genuine, possibly related to AGN feedback effects. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining near-infrared data and machine learning techniques to estimate photometric redshifts at low Galactic latitudes, providing useful information for future spectroscopic follow-up campaigns.
#### Unified Kraft Break at ~6500 K: A Newly Identified Single-Star Obliquity Transition Matches the Classical Rotation Break

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar obliquity transition, defined by a $\textit{T}_{\rm eff}$ cut separating aligned from misaligned hot Jupiter systems, has long been assumed to coincide with the rotational Kraft break. Yet the commonly quoted obliquity transition (6100 or 6250 K) sits a few hundred kelvin cooler than the rotational break (~6500 K), posing a fundamental inconsistency. We show this offset arises primarily from binaries/multiple-star systems, which drive the cooler stellar obliquity transition ($6105^{+123}_{-133}$ K), although the underlying cause remains ambiguous. After removing binaries and higher-order multiples, the single-star stellar obliquity transition shifts upward to $6447^{+85}_{-119}$ K, in excellent agreement with the single-star rotation break ($6510^{+97}_{-127}$ K). This revision has two immediate consequences for understanding the origin and evolution of spin-orbit misalignment. First, the upward shift reclassifies some hosts previously labeled `hot' into the cooler regime; consequently, there are very few RM measurements of non-hot-Jupiter planets around genuinely hot stars ($T_{\rm eff}\gtrsim6500\,\mathrm{K}$), and previously reported alignment trends for these classes of systems (e.g., warm Jupiters and compact multi-planet systems) lose the power to discriminate the central question: are large misalignments unique to hot-Jupiter-like planets that can be delivered by high-$e$ migration, or are hot stars intrinsically more misaligned across architectures? Second, a single-star stellar obliquity transition near $6500\,\mathrm{K}$, coincident with the rotational break, favors tidal dissipation in outer convective envelopes; as these envelopes thin with increasing $T_{\rm eff}$, inertial-wave damping and magnetic braking weaken in tandem.

 - **Abstract**
 The POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) mission incorporates an advanced data processing system (DP) to enable the detection and characterization of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and astrophysical neutrinos. The data acquisition (DAQ) system integrates inputs from the Cherenkov Camera, the Fluorescence Camera, the Radio Instrument and the X-Gamma detectors, ensuring synchronized event detection. Built upon the heritage of the EUSO-SPB2 DAQ architecture, the system has been adapted to support both the hybrid focal surface and radio instrumentation. The DP features two redundant CPUs, differential GPS receivers, and environmental monitoring capabilities, including temperature, humidity, and gyroscope-based orientation tracking. A central clock board synchronizes data collection across all instruments, ensuring precise event reconstruction. The main trigger and clock board manages trigger signals from different detectors, supporting both joint and independent data acquisition modes. These advancements enhance the mission's contribution to multi-messenger astrophysics and provide valuable insights for future space-based observatories. In this paper, we describe the system's main components and the design developed for this new mission.
