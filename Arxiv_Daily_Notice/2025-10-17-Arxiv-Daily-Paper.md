 - **Abstract**
 Ca II absorbers, characterized by dusty and metal-rich environments, provide unique insights into the interstellar medium of galaxies. However, their rarity and weak absorption features have hindered comprehensive studies. In this work, we present a novel dual CNN approach to detect Ca II absorption systems, analyzing over 100,000 quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 16. Our primary CNN identifies Ca II features, while a secondary CNN cross-verifies these detections using five Fe II absorption lines. This approach yielded 1,646 Ca II absorption systems, including 525 previously known absorbers and 1,121 new discoveries, nearly tripling the size of any previously reported catalog. Among our Ca II absorbers, 95 are found to show the 2175Å dust feature (2DA), corresponding to 22% of strong absorbers, 7% of weak absorbers, and $\sim$12% of the overall Ca II population at $0.8 < z_{\text{abs}} < 1.4$. Across the full redshift range of $0.36 < z_{\text{abs}} < 1.4$, $\sim$1.5% of Mg II absorbers host Ca II.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) scheme that enables three-dimensional simulations resolving both protostellar interiors and their surrounding accretion flows within a single framework, to clarify how a protostar evolves while interacting with the accretion flow. The method builds on an explicit M1 closure scheme with a reduced speed of light approximation (RSLA) for massively parallel computation. Our scheme introduces a complementary non-RSLA radiation component that dominates in optically thick regions. This hybrid treatment restores physical energy conservation inside protostars, which would otherwise be violated under the RSLA, while retaining the advantage of large time steps. To overcome the limitation of the conventional M1 closure in solving radiative transfer in extremely optically thick regions inside protostars and across steep optical-depth gradients near their surfaces, we incorporate the optical-depth information of neighboring cells into the radiative transfer calculation. We further evolve photon number densities in addition to radiation energy densities to reconstruct an effective local spectrum on the fly without resorting to costly multi-frequency transport. We implement this scheme in the adaptive mesh refinement code SFUMATO and verify its validity through a series of test calculations. As an application, we follow the early evolution of a massive protostar formed at high redshift, within a full cosmological context. The results reveal a continuous structure connecting the swollen protostar and its surrounding disk, which cannot be captured in conventional one-dimensional models. This explicit RHD scheme opens a path to studies of protostellar evolution and its interaction with the accretion flow in realistic three-dimensional environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Metal absorbers represent a powerful probe of galaxy feedback and reionization, as highlighted by both observational and theoretical results showing an increased abundance of low-ionised metal species at higher redshifts. The origin of such absorbers is currently largely unknown because of the low number of galaxy counterparts detected, suggesting that they might be surrounded by low-mass faint sources that fall below the detection threshold of current instruments. We use the THESAN-ZOOM radiation hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the connection between properties of neutral oxygen (OI) absorbers and galaxies within the redshift range $z = 5 - 8$. We find that the circumgalactic medium of galaxies becomes progressively ionised with cosmic time, leading to a decrease of $\approx 0.2$ in the covering fraction of neutral oxygen, while the total oxygen covering fraction remains constant. The observable absorbers ($N_{\rm OI} \gtrsim 10^{13}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$) are not confined to haloes: at $z \geq 5$ the majority ($\gtrsim 60\%$) arise beyond $R_{\rm{vir}}$, and including these systems is essential to reproduce the observed increase in absorber incidence with redshift. The simulated absorbers preferentially reside in overdensities rich in low-mass galaxies ($M_\star \leq 10^8\,\rm{M}_\odot$), explaining the scarcity of detected counterparts, while not excluding the possibility of nearby star-forming sources ($\geq 5\,\text{M}_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$) similar to those suggested by the latest ALMA observations and, at larger distances, by the JWST. These results establish OI absorbers as sensitive tracers of the evolving ionisation structure around faint galaxies to be probed by forthcoming deep spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) and their associated stellar streams are key tracers of the hierarchical assembly history of the Milky Way. $\omega$ Centauri, the most massive and chemically complex GC in the Galaxy, is widely believed to be the remnant nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy. Identifying its associated debris and that of chemically similar clusters can provide important constraints on the nature of this progenitor system. We aim to identify field stars that are chemically and kinematically linked to $\omega$ Cen and to a group of globular clusters associated with the Nephele accretion event. We analyse APOGEE DR17 data using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) in a 8-dimensional chemical space to identify field stars whose abundances match those of $\omega$ Cen. We then compute the orbital energy and angular momentum of these stars and apply a second GMM, calibrated on simulations from the e-TidalGCs project, to determine kinematic compatibility with the predicted streams of $\omega$ Cen and the associated Nephele GCs. We identify 470 stars chemically compatible with $\omega$ Cen, of which 58 are also Al-rich, consistent with second-generation stars found in GCs. Of these, 6 stars show kinematics consistent with the predicted $\omega$ Cen stream, and additional stars are linked to the tidal streams of NGC 6205, NGC 6254, NGC 6273, NGC 6656, and NGC 6809. We also find overlap in chemical and kinematic properties between Nephele stars and the Gaia Sausage-Enceladus population. Our findings indicate stellar debris linked to $\omega$ Cen and its candidate globular cluster family, consistent with a shared, now-disrupted galactic progenitor. Despite residual uncertainties from disc contamination and limited sky coverage, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of combined chemical and dynamical analyses in uncovering relics of past accretion events in the inner Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) merger remnant are a cheap alternative to 3D simulations. To maintain realism for secular timescales, simulations must avoid accumulated errors from drifts in conserved quantities and artificial heating, and they must model turbulent transport in a way that remains plausible throughout the evolution. It is also crucial to avoid numerical artifacts due to the polar coordinate axis singularity. Methods that behave well near the axis often break flux-conservative form of the hydrodynamic equations, resulting in significant drifts in conserved quantities. We present a flux-conservative scheme that maintains smoothness near the axis without sacrificing conservative formulation of the equations or incurring drifts in conserved global quantities. We compare the numerical performance of different treatments of the hydrodynamic equations when evolving a hypermassive neutron star resembling the remnant of a BNS merger. These simulations demonstrate that the new scheme combines the axis smoothness of non-conservative methods with the mass and angular momentum conservation of other conservative methods on $\sim$ $10^2$ ms timescales of viscous and neutrino-driven evolution. Because fluid profiles remain smooth in the remnant interior, it is possible to remove artificial heating by evolving the entropy density. We show how physical heating and cooling terms can be easily calculated from source terms of the conservative evolution variables and demonstrate our implementation. Finally, we discuss and implement improvements to the effective viscosity scheme to better model the effect of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities as the remnant evolves.
#### A formation mechanism for narrow rings around minor bodies

 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery of narrow rings around minor bodies has raised many questions regarding their origin and current dynamics. Sharp ring boundaries seem indicative of shepherding moonlets, but none have been found. All rings lie close to spin-orbit resonances (SORs) with the central body, particularly the 1/3, even though it is not clear how these may be related. Furthermore, in at least one case the location of the ring is exterior to the Roche radius, adding to the striking differences with respect to giant planets. We study the dynamical evolution of a particle disk around a minor body, perturbed by the non-spherical component of the gravity field, particle collisions, and spin changes of the central mass linked to angular momentum conservation. By varying key parameters, we search for cases where the combined effects may lead to resonance capture and orbital configurations similar to those that have been observed. We performed N-body simulations of massless particles orbiting a central spherical body with a co-rotating mass anomaly. Collisions were modeled by adopting a simple radial damping force. Angular momentum conservation links the body spin to the disk orbital evolution. Since the gravitational effect of the test particles is neglected, this back-reaction is introduced externally assuming ad hoc spin-down rates and disk mass. Interaction between non-sphericity and collisions leads to the formation of a narrow ring that slowly recedes from the central mass. Spin-down of the minor planet shifts the SORs outward, enabling resonant capture. For suitable parameters, a portion -or all- of the initial disk can become trapped in the 1/3 SOR with the mass anomaly, in dynamically stable low-eccentricity orbits. Although the required disk mass is high ($\ge 1\%$ of the central body), long-term collisional erosion could reduce it to values that are consistent with observed ringlets.

 - **Abstract**
 Gyrochronology, a method for dating aged field stars ($\gtrsim$ a few Gyr) based on their rotation rate, has recently been shown to fail for many stars older than the sun. The explanation most often put forth is that a shutdown or mode change in the stellar dynamo leads to a sharp decrease in angular momentum loss in magnetized coronal winds. In this paper, we explore an alternate possibility, namely a collapse of the wind itself through a reduction of coronal heating. We show that in the low coronal temperature ($T_0$) limit, even at solar-like low rotation rates ($\Omega$) and coronal magnetic field strength ($B_{r0}$), magnetocentrifugal effects are important and preclude expression of the mass and angular momentum loss rates as power-laws of $T_0$ or $\Omega$ when $T_0$ drops below $\simeq 1.5\,$MK. Mass loss is found to scale linearly with power input into the wind at all coronal temperatures. Introducing an ad hoc power law relationship $T_0\propto B_{r0}^\sigma$ while retaining the ``standard'' dynamo relationship $B_{r0}\propto\Omega$, we show that reproducing the observed break in gyrochronology requires an exponent $\sigma\gtrsim 1.5$, with which is associated a drop by over 3 orders of magnitude in power input into the quiet corona. This appears physically unrealistic, given current observations of chromospheric and coronal non-thermal emission in aged solar-type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Several radio telescopes have been planned or proposed to be deployed on the Lunar farside in the coming years. These will observe the unexplored ultra-long wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum from the lunar farside's unique radio-quiet and ionosphere-free environment. One such lunar radio array is the NASA-funded concept - the Farside Array for Radio Science Investigations of the Dark Ages and Exoplanets (FARSIDE). FARSIDE will operate over 100~kHz to 40~MHz with 128 spatially non-co-located orthogonal pairs of antenna nodes distributed over a 12 X 12 km area in a four-arm spiral configuration. Being on the lunar farside, this radio interferometer will be deployed by tele-operated rovers. The rover deployment mode could lead to a phase offset between each of the two orthogonally polarised antenna elements in the array, which are typically co-located. In this paper, we quantify the effects of such antenna phase offsets on the polarisation response and imaging performance of the lunar radio array. Modelling and analysing the FARSIDE dipole beams with and without offset, we find the latter leads to additional leakages into Stokes U and V corresponding to Muller matrix terms of M2(0,1,2,3) and M3(0,1,2,3). Using a custom simulation pipeline to incorporate all four Stokes beams of spatially co-located and non-co-located dipoles, we produce visibilities and simulated images for the GLEAM (GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA) sky model through the FARSIDE array. We find that for a pure Stokes I input sky, the output image maximum Stokes V/I flux ratio for the offset case has increased to 2.5% versus 0.05% for the co-located case. The additional Stokes V needs to be corrected since the detection of Electron Cyclotron Maser (ECM) emissions from exoplanets requires high-fidelity Stokes V measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Star-forming activity in the host galaxies of high-redshift quasars is crucial to understanding the connection between supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity and galaxy evolution. While most existing studies are biased toward luminous quasars, we conduct carbon monoxide (CO) observations of 17 gravitationally lensed quasars that have four images using the IRAM 30m telescope to investigate the molecular gas content of moderate- to low-luminosity quasars. CO emissions are detected in five out of 17 quasars, corresponding to a detection rate of about 30\%. Analysis of their star formation activity reveals that these quasars live in gas-rich environments but exhibit weaker starbursts and lower star formation efficiencies compared to other luminous high-redshift quasars. In addition, the CO spectral line energy distributions of the two quasars (SDSS J0924+0219, SDSS J1330+1810) are also consistent with mild star formation instead of extreme starbursts. These results suggest that these lensed quasars reside in weaker starburst environments.
#### Is GW231123 a hierarchical merger?

 - **Abstract**
 The binary black hole merger GW231123 is both the most massive gravitational-wave event observed and has the highest component spins measured to date. The dimensionless spins of the more massive (primary) and less massive (secondary) black holes are measured to be $\chi_1 = 0.90^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $\chi_2 = 0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$ ($90\%$ credible intervals), respectively. Its large mass and extremal spins are challenging to explain through standard binary stellar physics, though a flurry of hypothetical scenarios have been proposed. Hierarchical assembly -- i.e., mergers of black holes that are themselves formed from previous generations of mergers -- is generally a promising way to explain massive and rapidly spinning black holes. Here, we investigate the possibility that both GW231123 was assembled hierarchically in a dense star cluster as the merger of two second-generation black holes. Taking the inferred spin values at face value, we find that it is possible, though unlikely ($p\lesssim 1\%$), that a compact binary with both component spins like GW231123 could form in a cluster from hierarchical assembly.

 - **Abstract**
 The International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) SETI Committee has long provided guiding principles for responding to a potential detection of a SETI signal. The foundational Declaration of Principles Concerning Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence, first formulated in 1989, has been widely recognised by the international scientific community. A supplemental set of draft protocols addressing the possibility of a reply to an extraterrestrial signal was prepared in 1995 by the IAA SETI Permanent Committee, with both documents presented in a position paper to the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in 2000. In keeping with the evolving landscape of SETI research, the IAA Declaration of Principles was streamlined and updated in 2010. Recognising the need for continued adaptation, the IAA SETI Committee established a Task Group in 2022 to re-examine the protocols in light of recent advances in search methodologies, the expansion of international participation in SETI, and the increasing complexity of the global information environment. The Group recognises the living document nature of the protocols, which will require ongoing refinement to remain relevant and effective in a rapidly changing world. A draft revised Declaration of Principles was presented at the IAC 2024 in Milan, and initial feedback was received from the community, particularly members of the IAA SETI Committee. Since then, we have continued to seek broader community input in a structured process, refining the proposed updates based on further discussions and consultations. A Revised Declaration of Principles, is presented here.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale outflows driven by AGNs are an important element of galaxy evolution. Detailed analysis of their properties allows us to probe the activity history of the galactic nucleus and, potentially, other properties of the host galaxy. A recent paper presents detailed radial velocity profiles of outflows in ten AGN host galaxies and shows a common trend of approximately constant velocity in the centre followed by rapid acceleration outside $R_{\rm tr} \sim 1 - 3$ kpc. We show that this is a consequence of the AGN-driven outflows clearing the gaseous bulges of the host galaxies and beginning to expand into a region of negligible gas density. We used a 1D semi-analytical code to calculate outflow propagation in each of the ten galaxies, assuming a constant AGN luminosity and an isothermal bulge density profile, with a finite bulge radius, and leaving the gas fraction and total mass of the bulge as free parameters. We also considered the effect of different gas density profiles, variations in bulge velocity dispersion, AGN luminosity, and the effect of outflow fragmentation. Our simplest model can fit six outflow profiles essentially perfectly, while another can be fit if the bulge gas density profile is shallower than isothermal. A shallower density profile also improves the fit in the central regions of the remaining three outflows, but they accelerate faster than our models predict; this could be evidence of significant gas cooling and star formation that reduce the total mass of outflowing gas. We conclude that a simple AGN-driven wind feedback model can explain the detailed velocity profiles of real outflows in local AGN hosts. The free parameters of our model have values that fall well within reasonable ranges. This suggests that the simple scenario we envisioned is close to the true conditions governing the general trends of large-scale outflow expansion.
#### Detection of spin-modulated circular polarisation and radial velocity variations in the long period Intermediate Polar 1RXS J080114.6-462324

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric study of the intermediate polar (IP) 1RXS J080114.6-462324, using observations from the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) 1.0-m and 1.9-m telescopes and the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), complemented by archival TESS photometry. Photometric and photo-polarimetric data reveal a coherent modulation at the white dwarf (WD) spin period. TESS confirms periodicities of 1307.517 s (spin) and 11.803 h (orbital). Photopolarimetric and circular spectropolarimetric measurements show circular polarisation reaching ~+5%, modulated with the WD spin period, consistent with cyclotron emission from an accreting magnetic pole. Time-resolved optical spectra display prominent Balmer (H$\gamma$, H$\beta$, and H$\alpha$) and He\textsc{ii} $\lambda$4686 emission features and additional He\textsc{i} emissions, all exhibiting minimal radial-velocity variations. We detect red-shifted absorption dips adjacent to the He\textsc{ii} and H$\beta$ lines, modulated at the WD spin period; periodogram analysis of the emission lines also yields spin modulation. These observations indicate that the system is a disc-fed, low-inclination IP. The combination of circular polarisation and spin-modulated absorption by infalling accretion curtain material supports this classification. Its comparatively long orbital period among IPs and the detection of polarised emission render 1RXS J080114.6-462324 an appealing candidate for evolutionary studies, potentially offering insight into how magnetic accretion systems evolve toward synchronism at longer orbital periods.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: Studying the dynamical evolution of young clusters is crucial for a more general understanding of the star formation process. Methods: We took spectra of >600 candidate pre-main sequence (PMS) stars in several nearby young clusters (NGC 2264 N & S, Collinder 95, and Collinder 359) using MMT/Hectospec. These spectra were analyzed for H{\alpha} emission and lithium absorption, features indicative of low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) still in their PMS evolution. We complemented these samples with YSOs identified via Gaia DR3 variability. In conjunction with Gaia astrometry, these data enable an analysis of cluster structure, kinematics and ages. In particular, we searched for halos of YSOs around our targets to test models of young cluster dynamical evolution. Results: For the NGC 2264 N & S cluster pair we identified 354 YSOs, while for Collinder 95 and 359 we identified 130 and 7 YSOs, respectively. We calculate kinematic "traceback ages" for YSOs in these clusters, which we compare to isochronal ages estimated using several sets of stellar evolution models. We find for NGC 2264 N & S that kinematic ages are generally smaller than their isochronal ages, which may indicate these systems remained bound for a few Myr before their current state of expansion. On the other hand, kinematic ages for Collinder 95 are often significantly larger than isochronal ages, which implies many of these YSOs did not originate from a central, dense region, leading to overestimated kinematic ages. Conclusions: We conclude that NGC 2264 N & S clusters likely formed as initially bound and compact systems, but have been gradually evaporating as cluster members become unbound, forming halos of unbound YSOs surrounding the cluster cores. We conclude that Collinder 95 likely formed initially sparse and substructured and has been dispersing since gas expulsion.
#### Mergers lighting the early Universe: enhanced star formation, AGN triggering, and Ly$α$ emission in close pairs at $z=3-9$

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers and interactions are often invoked to explain enhanced star formation, black hole growth, and mass build-up of galaxies at later cosmic times, but their effect is poorly understood at high redshift ($z>2$). We use JADES data to analyse a mass-complete sample of 2095 galaxies at $z=3-9$ with ${\rm log}(M_\star/{\rm M_\odot}) = [8, 10]$, identifying major merger pairs (projected separation of $5-100$ pkpc, mass ratio $\geq 1/4$) using a probabilistic method. To look for signatures of enhancement in multiple physical properties, we carefully build a control sample of non-pairs that are simultaneously matched in redshift, stellar mass, isolation, and environment to the pair sample. We find a moderate enhancement in specific star formation rate (sSFR) of $1.12 \pm 0.05$ at separations $\lesssim 20$ kpc, which is weakly detectable out to $\sim50$ kpc. We find that at longer averaging timescales (50-100 Myr) the sSFR is more affected by interactions and environment, whereas at shorter timescales (5-10 Myr) it is dominated by internal feedback and burstiness. By averaging star formation histories, we find two distinct populations: pre-first passage/coalescence (monotonically rising SFR) and post-pericentre pairs (earlier peak in SFR). Finally, we find no significant excess of AGN in pairs, suggesting galaxy interactions are not effectively triggering black hole activity at separations $>5$ kpc. Similarly, we also do not detect an excess in the fraction of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters in pairs, implying that at the probed separations, galaxy interactions are not efficient at enhancing Lyman-$\alpha$ photon production and escape, which may only become important at the smallest scales.

 - **Abstract**
 A VLT/MUSE population synthesis study of metallicities in the nuclear star-forming rings of four disk galaxies (NGC 613, NGC 1097, NGC 3351, NGC 7552) is presented. Disentangling the spectral contributions of young and old stellar populations, we find a large spread of ages and metallicities of the old stars in the nuclear rings. This indicates a persistent infall of metal-poor gas and ongoing episodic star formation over many gigayears. The young stars have metallicities a factor two to three higher than solar in all galaxies except NGC 3351, where the range is from half to twice solar. Previously reported detections of extremely metal poor regions at young stellar age on the rings of these four galaxies are a methodological artifact of the average over all stars, young and old. In addition, it is important to include contributions of very young stars ($<6$ Myr) in this environment. For each of the four galaxies, the extinction maps generated through our population synthesis analysis provide support for the infall scenario. They reveal dust lanes along the leading edges of the stellar bars, indicating the flow of interstellar material towards the circumnuclear zone. Prominent stellar clusters show little extinction, most likely because of the onset of stellar winds. Inside and on the nuclear rings, regions that are largely free of extinction are detected.

 Strong gravitational lensing provides a powerful tool to directly infer the dark matter (DM) subhalo mass function (SHMF) in lens galaxies. However, comparing observationally inferred SHMFs to theoretical predictions remains challenging, as the predicted SHMF can vary significantly between galaxies - even within the same cosmological model - due to differences in the properties and environment of individual galaxies. We present a machine learning framework to infer the galaxy-specific predicted SHMF from galaxy images, conditioned on the assumed inverse warm DM particle mass $M^{-1}_{\rm DM}$. To train the model, we use 1024 high-resolution hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations from the DREAMS suite. Mock observations are generated using Synthesizer, excluding gas particle contributions, and SHMFs are computed with the Rockstar halo finder. Our neural network takes as input both the galaxy images and the inverse DM mass. This method enables scalable, image-based predictions for the theoretical DM SHMFs of individual galaxies, facilitating direct comparisons with observational measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf galaxies, due to their shallow gravitational potentials, provide critical environments for studying feedback mechanisms from star formation and its impacts on dwarf galaxy evolution. In particular, radio continuum (RC) observations offer valuable insights into cosmic ray dynamics, which play a significant role in shaping these processes. This study investigates the detectability and spectral characteristics of RC emission in a sample of 15 dwarf galaxies (11 gas-rich, star forming dwarfs and 4 blue compact dwarfs) spanning a broad range of stellar masses and star formation histories. Using multi-band RC data (L/S-, C-, and X-band) from the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we analyse the physical conditions responsible for RC emission and explore the dominant emission mechanisms within these systems. RC emission is detected in 11 out of the 15 galaxies. Our results indicate that RC emission correlates strongly with star formation rate, far-infrared, and stellar mass, while dynamic parameters such as HI and rotational velocity exhibit no significant correlation with RC detectability. Spectral analysis reveals that the RC spectral energy distribution in these galaxies frequently deviate from a simple power-law behavior, instead displaying curvature that suggests more complex underlying physical processes. Statistical model comparison confirms that a single power-law model is inadequate to capture the observed spectral shapes, emphasising the necessity of more sophisticated approaches. Additionally, the observed radio-far-infrared correlation indicates that cosmic ray electrons in lower-mass dwarf galaxies cool more rapidly than they can escape (e.g. via galactic winds), resulting in a measurable RC deficit.

 - **Abstract**
 M dwarfs have long been prime targets in the search for habitable exoplanets, owing to their abundance in the galaxy and the relative ease of detecting Earth-sized worlds within their narrower habitable zones. Yet, these low-mass stars can emit high-energy radiation that may gradually erode planetary atmospheres, raising concerns about long-term habitability. TOI-700, a relatively quiescent M dwarf that hosts four known planets, stands out due to its Earth-sized TOI-700 d in the star's habitable zone. Here, we assess whether a habitable environment can be sustained on TOI-700 d by analyzing different UV flux levels and atmospheric pressures. We focus on two atmospheric scenarios - one analogous to the Archean Earth and another representing a modern Earth-like environment - using a 1D photochemistry-climate model. Our results indicate that all simulated cases can maintain temperatures compatible with liquid water on the surface. However, the dominant photochemical pathways differ substantially with UV levels: under low-UV conditions, haze formation in the Archean-like atmosphere provides the main UV shielding, whereas under intensified UV, ozone production in the modern-like atmospheres can protect the surface from harmful doses. Interestingly, although haze can impede the detection of certain biosignatures, such as CH4, CO2 and O2, it also enhances the overall atmospheric signal by increasing scattering and transit depth, potentially aiding in revealing the presence of an atmosphere. These findings underscore the dual role of hazes as both a challenge for biosignature detection and a potential protection of surface habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy enables dynamical mass measurements for typical star-forming galaxies only a billion years after the Big Bang. We model the H$\alpha$ morpho-kinematics of 163 galaxies at redshift $z\approx4$-6 from FRESCO and CONGRESS (with JADES imaging), using the $\texttt{geko}$ code, and infer rotational velocities and dispersions within $r_{\rm e}$. Our sample spans $\log M_{\star}\approx7$-10 and $\log M_{\rm dyn}\approx9$-11. Gas masses are estimated via scaling relations, yielding baryonic masses and dark-matter (DM) fractions $f_{\rm DM}(r<r_{\rm e})$ within the H$\alpha$ half-light radius. We find high median fractions of $\langle f_{\rm gas}\rangle=0.77$ and $\langle f_{\rm DM}\rangle=0.73$, where $f_{\rm gas}$ is measured with respect to the baryonic mass and $f_{\rm DM}$ with respect to the DM+baryonic mass. About two-thirds of systems are DM-dominated within $r_{\rm e}\sim0.5-1$ kpc. Both $f_{\rm gas}$ and $f_{\rm DM}$ decrease with stellar mass, consistent with simulations. The stellar Tully-Fisher relation shows a tentative offset to higher $v_{\rm circ}$ at fixed $M_{\star}$ and substantial intrinsic scatter, suggesting that the relation is only beginning to emerge at $z\sim5$. We measure a negative correlation between $f_{\rm DM}$ and baryonic surface density $\Sigma_{\rm bar}$, weaker but broadly consistent with trends at cosmic noon and at $z\sim0$. Qualitatively comparing with modified NFW profiles coupled to an empirical stellar-to-halo mass relation suggests that the lowest $f_{\rm DM}$ ($\lesssim0.4$) require cored inner DM profiles, while the highest fractions favour cuspier profiles, potentially reflecting adiabatic contraction. Overall, the elevated $f_{\rm gas}$ and $f_{\rm DM}$ at $z\gtrsim4$ are compatible with progenitors of baryon-dominated systems at $z\sim2$ and naturally anticipate overmassive black holes at fixed $M_{\star}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the possibility that inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of cosmic microwave background photons by $\sim$GeV cosmic rays (CRs) injected by the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) in cool core (CC) clusters produces a non-negligible continuum-like X-ray signal that is easily misinterpreted as intracluster medium (ICM) thermal bremsstrahlung continuum. This is particularly relevant to the cooling flow problem--the lack of star formation relative to X-ray-inferred ICM cooling rates. Using ZwCl 3146, a relaxed CC system at $z = 0.291$, we compare pressure profiles derived via X-rays and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. While SZ measurements probe only thermal ICM electrons, additional CR-IC emission would appear to boost the X-ray-inferred pressure. Relative to unity, we measure a $\simeq30\%$ decrement in $P_{SZ}/P_X$ within 100 kpc of the ZwCl 3146 center at a statistical significance of $\simeq 3.3\sigma$, consistent with predicted deficits from CR-IC contamination in reasonable models of central AGN-driven CR injection. X-ray spectral fits of a two-component model with thermal ICM and CR-IC emission are consistent with CR-IC as the cause of this deficit. We test alternative explanations and systematics that could drive such a decrement, with the leading order systematics associated with halo triaxiality. Collectively, these systematics are unlikely to produce a $P_{SZ}/P_X$ decrement $\gtrsim10\%$. While our results establish that non-negligible CR-IC emission is plausible in ZwCl 3146, we stress that more detailed studies of larger cluster samples are required to robustly assess whether CR-IC is relevant to the cooling flow problem.

 - **Abstract**
 The deuterium to hydrogen ratio in water ice in a planetary body carries important information on the history of water processing and delivery in the protostellar nebula. For a giant planet satellite, the D/H ratio is also affected by the processes and temperatures of the circumplanetary or circumstellar environment in which the satellites formed. Here we present robust JWST spectroscopic detections of the 4.14 $\mu$m O-D stretch absorption line (analogous to the 3 $\mu$m water O-H stretch) on the mid-sized Saturnian satellites and use these detections to infer a D/H ratio on each satellite. Within the limitations of the technique, we find that all of the satellites are consistent with having a D/H ratio of about $1.5 \times$ Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW), which is about an order of magnitude higher than the value of the atmosphere of Saturn. A much higher previously reported D/H ratio for Phoebe is ruled out at the 10$\sigma$ level, and a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 2.3 $\times$ VSMOW is obtained. The elevated D/H ratios demonstrate that the solid planetesimals and pebbles that built the satellites never sublimed and re-equilibrated with the gaseous circumplanetary disk. The similarity of the D/H measurements across all satellites suggest that the D/H ratio of water ice in the vicinity of Saturn at the time of satellite formation was also approximately 1.5 $\times$ VSMOW.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have revealed a surprisingly large fraction of hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe) interacting with dense confined circumstellar material (CSM), whose origin is heavily debated. Exploiting our recent implementation of a sophisticated radiation transport scheme in the moving-mesh code AREPO, we perform full-sphere 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of red supergiant envelopes. For $10\, M_\odot$ and $20\, M_\odot$ core-carbon-burning stars, we find that large-amplitude radial pulsations lift the surface material of density $10^{-14}$-$10^{-12}\; \mathrm{g\; cm^{-3}}$ to the circumstellar environment up to $3\times10^{14}$ cm, consistent with the inferred density for the interacting SN 2013fs. There, radiation acts on dust to drive highly anisotropic outflows of $10^{-6}$-$10^{-5}\, M_\odot\, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. The total CSM masses for both simulations are $\sim 0.01\, M_\odot$. Due to convection, the CSM density structure has order-of-magnitude angular variations, dominated by large-scale asymmetries. We suggest that (1) the CSM around the progenitor is bound material instead of a widely-assumed steady wind, (2) highly aspherical CSM is common and can be created by surface convection rather than only from binary interactions, and (3) 3D effects need to be incorporated in 1D SN modeling, potentially via effective clumping. Based on our simulations, we propose a 1D analytical CSM model to be directly used for SN observable modeling. We predict that progenitor pulsations (seen in SN 2023ixf) and highly-confined CSM (seen in SN 2013fs) should be common among most hydrogen-rich SNe. This can be tested with progenitor monitoring using Rubin Observatory and near-future high-cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT and UVEX.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm signal is a powerful probe of the early Universe's thermal history and could provide a unique avenue for constraining exotic physics. Previous studies have forecasted stringent constraints on energy injections from exotic sources that heat, excite, and ionize the background gas and thereby modify the 21-cm signal. In this work, we quantify the substantial impact that astrophysical uncertainties have on the projected sensitivity to exotic energy injection. In particular, there are significant uncertainties in the minimum star-forming dark matter halo mass, the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, and the X-ray emission, whose values characterize the fiducial astrophysical model when projecting bounds. As a case study, we investigate the energy injection of accreting primordial black holes of mass $\sim 1~M_\odot-10^3~M_\odot$, also taking into account uncertainties in the accretion model. We show that, depending on the chosen fiducial model and accretion uncertainties, the sensitivity of future 21-cm data could constrain the abundance of primordial black holes to be either slightly stronger, or significantly weaker, than current limits from the Cosmic Microwave Background.

 - **Abstract**
 GRB 230307A is one of the brightest long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) ever detected, yet its progenitor remains uncertain due to the variety of plausible astrophysical scenarios. In this work, we investigate four possible progenitors for GRB 230307A: a binary neutron star (BNS), a neutron star--white dwarf (NS--WD) system, a neutron star--black hole (NS--BH) merger, and a tidal disruption event (TDE) involving a white dwarf and a supermassive black hole. Additionally, we explore three distinct central engine models powering the kilonova associated with the BNS: radioactive decay of $r$-process nuclei in a two-component ejecta model, a magnetar-driven model including magnetic dipole spin-down, and a combined model of magnetar spin-down with ${}^{56}$Ni radioactive decay. We perform Bayesian multi-wavelength light-curve analyses using physically motivated models and priors, and evaluate model performance through Bayes factors and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) scores. Our results show a statistical preference for a BNS or NS--WD progenitor producing a kilonova powered by a magnetar and ${}^{56}$Ni decay, characterized by a ${}^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim4\times10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$ and an ejecta mass of $0.06\,M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, under the assumption of a BNS origin within this model, we infer binary component masses of $m_{1} = 1.81^{+0.46}_{-0.61}\,M_{\odot}$ and $m_{2} = 1.61^{+0.65}_{-0.41}\,M_{\odot}$, with a dimensionless tidal deformability of $\tilde{\Lambda} = 471^{+318}_{-395}$. From the component mass posteriors, we infer that the observed offset can be explained by a natal kick as long as the systemic velocity is nearly aligned with the pre-kick orbital motion. In this case, the required kick velocity (co-moving frame) and binary separation range within $v'_{\mathrm{k}}\sim100$--$150~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, and $a_0\sim2$--$3~R_{\odot}$, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 For the first time, we show in MHD simulations with cosmological initial conditions that bi-lobed gamma-ray outflows similar to the Fermi bubbles can form from star formation and supernova feedback, without involvement from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We use simulations run with full MHD and dynamical, on-the-fly multi-species cosmic ray transport in MeV-TeV energy bins to model gamma-ray emission in Milky Way-mass spiral galaxies from neutral pion decay, relativistic non-thermal Bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton scattering. We find that these gamma-ray outflows are present in all three Milky-Way mass simulated galaxies. The amplitude, shape, and the composition of the gamma-ray spectrum of these bubbles fluctuates over time, with lepton-dominated and hadron-dominated phases. Spectra in which there is O(1) more gamma-ray flux from inverse Compton scattering than neutral pion decay are a good fit to the measured Fermi-LAT spectrum. Additionally, these simulations predict multi-wavelength features in soft x-rays and synchrotron radio, potentially providing new observational signatures that can connect the circumgalactic medium to cosmic ray physics and activity in the galactic center.
