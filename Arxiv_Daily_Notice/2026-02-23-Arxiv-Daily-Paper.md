 - **Abstract**
 Young massive clusters (YMCs) provide favorable environments for frequent stellar collisions, potentially leading to the formation of very massive stars (VMSs) and seeds of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We investigate the role of repeated stellar collisions in YMCs using TITANS, a new suite of 18 direct $N$-body simulations. Our models span cluster masses $10^5 - 10^6\,\rm M_\odot$, half-mass densities $\rho_{\rm h}=100 - 10^5\,\rm M_\odot\,pc^{-3}$, and include high primordial binary fractions, consistent with observations of massive stars in young clusters. Overall, our simulations assume cluster properties that are typical of YMCs in the low-redshift Universe. We find that repeated stellar collisions are efficient only in the densest clusters with short relaxation times and are absent in systems with $\rho_{\rm h}<500\,\rm M_\odot\,pc^{-3}$ and $t_{\rm rh}>1.3\,\rm Gyr$. Rapid mass segregation allows massive stars to sink to the cluster center, merge, and undergo subsequent collisions, even in clusters with long core-collapse times. However, collision chains are typically triggered by primordial binary mergers and usually involve only two collisions. In our simulations, only three VMSs form through repeated collisions and reach $m_*>330\,\rm M_\odot$, while most VMSs have $m_*<300\,\rm M_\odot$ and form through primordial binary mergers. None constitute viable IMBH seeds, as their helium cores fall in the (pulsational) pair-instability regime. We form five IMBHs from stellar collisions involving stars at different evolutionary stages, while the dominant channel is the merger of stellar-mass black holes, producing twelve IMBHs. For properties typical of local YMCs, stellar collision chains are therefore inefficient in producing IMBHs more massive than $140\,\rm M_\odot$, as most collisionally formed VMSs attain masses that fall in the pair-instability regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation within filaments may arise due to the growth of cores according to linear perturbation theory. This implies a minimum core separation, as shorter modes would not be able to grow. While many observations agree with core separations by theoretical predictions, some observations also show star forming cores which lie closer together than the minimum wavelength given by perturbation theory. We explore whether non-linear effects during the late stages of core growth can explain the discrepancy between theory and observations. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the Ramses code to follow the evolution of initial perturbations within filaments and compare the measured growth rates to expectations from theoretical models. Non-linear evolution sets in as soon as the core mass reaches a value where the gravitational potential is not any longer dominated by the cylindrical potential of the filament but by the spherical potential of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. Consequently, core collapse is not triggered by the loss of hydrostatic stability of the filament but by the loss of hydrostatic stability of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. As the core is embedded in the filament, the maximum core mass is given by the pressure within the filament which results in a constant line-mass threshold for core collapse. As core collapse is triggered as soon as overdensities reach a certain line-mass, cores which form as large line-mass perturbations during filament formation can go into direct collapse even if their separation is closer than predicted by linear perturbation theory. Therefore, our result can explain the discrepancy between theory and observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Many post-starburst galaxies at $z\sim0.7$ have been shown to retain substantial molecular gas reservoirs yet host low ongoing star formation, suggesting that the remaining gas may be inefficient at forming stars during the early post-burst phase. We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO(5-4) observations of nine gas-rich post-starburst galaxies at $z\sim0.7$ from the Studying Quenching in Intermediate-z Galaxies: Gas, angu$\vec{L}$ar momentum, and Evolution (SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E) survey, providing a view of the molecular gas excitation in these systems. Combined with existing CO(2-1) data, we detect CO(5-4) in 8/9 targets and find that most have moderate CO excitation with $r_{52}\equiv L'_{\rm CO(5-4)}/L'_{\rm CO(2-1)}\approx0.1-0.3$. These systems show no clear trend between $r_{52}$ and either total or surface-density of star formation. Specifically, all objects have $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}} \sim 0.01-1\ \text{M}_\odot\ \text{yr}^{-1}\ \text{kpc}^{-2}$, consistent with compact, modest star formation, even when allowing for buried activity, as these galaxies decline from their peak. One object J1448+1010, which has clear optical, mid-infrared, and radio indicators of an active galactic nucleus, is an outlier with $r_{52}\approx0.6$; its elevated excitation likely requires significant non-stellar heating, with a contribution from potentially obscured star formation. Together, most gas-rich SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E post-starbursts have moderately excited molecular gas alongside little to modest star-forming activity, indicating that the remaining gas hosts relatively suppressed star formation efficiencies instead of strong buried starburst activity.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutral gas outflows play a crucial role in the baryon cycle of galaxies, their properties provide key insights into the transition from star formation to quiescence. In this work, we investigate the neutral gas outflow of 23 massive ($M_\star = 10^{10.1-11.6}\,\rm M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z=2.82--4.61, selected from the JWST NIRSpec (R~1000) and NIRCam program DeepDive. We trace the neutral gas outflows using the NaI Doublet absorption lines and detect excess NaI D in 13/23 (57%) targets, of which 7/23 (30%) show blueshifted absorption with velocity offsets $|{\Delta}v|$ >~ 150 km/s. The z ~ 3.5 targets have ${\Delta}v$ similar to those of their local counterparts; they are also equivalent when compared in SFR--${\Delta}v$ space. We derive mass outflow rates and identify the most extreme neutral gas outflow rate $\log(\dot M_{\rm out} / \mathrm{M_\odot \, yr}^{-1})=2.68\pm0.27$ beyond the local Universe, coincident with an X-ray AGN. For all NaI D detected systems, the inferred mass outflow rate can, in principle, suppress ongoing star formation; however, the outflows are unlikely to escape their hosts, suggesting recycling on relatively short timescales (~3--180 Myr), depending on the assumed potential and launching radius. All NaI D detected targets occupy the LI(N)ER region of the BPT diagram and/or are X-ray detected, but we find no strong correlation between ongoing AGN and the neutral outflow: 2/4 broad-line/X-ray AGNs are NaI D undetected -- yet, the outflows can be powered by fossil/episodic AGNs, and one broad-line target shows a possible P-Cygni profile that indicates strong outflows. As neutral outflows alone are not able to permanently quench star formation by removing gas in our sample at z ~ 3.5, the presence of gas cycling in and out of massive passive systems may instead be the signature of feedback-regulated quenching-maintenance processes.

 - **Abstract**
 To gain deeper insights into galaxy evolution and the mechanisms driving transitions between different galaxy morphologies, we analyse the connection between star formation rate and stellar mass for 231 galaxies spanning Hubble types E1-Sdm from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Spectroscopy Area survey using three complementary classification schemes. The Hubble classification provides structural information, the circular velocity curve classification$-$based on principal component analysis$-$ traces the total gravitational potential, and the Quenching classification$-$derived from H$_{\alpha}$ equivalent width maps$-$indicates the spatial extent of quenched regions relative to star-forming areas. We find a clear separation of galaxy populations on the star formation rate-stellar mass plane. Late-type spirals with slow-rising circular velocity curves, represented by star-forming and quiescent-nuclear-ring galaxies, dominate the blue cloud. Early-type spirals with flat or round-peaked circular velocity curves belonging to centrally quiescent or mixed class populate the green valley, representing a transitional stage. Elliptical and lenticular galaxies with round- or sharp-peaked circular velocity curves from nearly retired or fully retired QSs reside on the red sequence. Furthermore, our results indicate that the morphological groups Sc-Scd, Sd-Sdm, and E1-E3 are characterized by a unique set of QSs and circular velocity curves, while galaxies with morphologies such as Sa-Sbc spread over multiple QSs and circular velocity curves. The distribution of the classification classes shows a tight link between galaxy structure, gravitational potential, and suppression of star-formation in the galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 To date, there has been significant interest in globular cluster (GC)-rich ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) and the evidence that they have formed via an unexpected, ``failed galaxy'' formation pathway. The majority of the evidence for ``failed galaxy'' UDGs originates from spectroscopic observations targeting passive GC-rich UDGs, with a focus on those residing in galaxy clusters. In this work, we study the gas-rich, GC-rich group UDG MATLAS-42 and derive its stellar population properties using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager. We measure a redshift for the galaxy ($V_{\rm R, \star}=2433\pm8$~km s$^{-1}$), confirming the previous assumptions that it is both part of the NGC~502 group and has an associated HI-reservoir ($V_{\rm R,HI}=2423\pm 15$~km s$^{-1}$). We measure integrated stellar populations and find the galaxy to be both young (mass-weighted age $=3.2^{+2.6}_{-1.5}$Gyr) and of average-to-low metallicity ($[M/H]=-1.19^{+0.42}_{-0.30}$ dex). When considering these properties in the context of the galaxy's formation, we note it likely does not follow the ``failed galaxy'' formation pathway commonly attributed to GC-rich, cluster UDGs, as it has experienced recent star formation. At most it started failed, however, it has recently rejuvenated its star formation. Finally, we build a toy model of the passive evolution of this galaxy, finding that its relative GC-richness (i.e., $M_{\rm GC}/M_\star$) will likely decrease with time as GCs slowly evaporate/disrupt to contribute to the stellar mass of the galaxy. Due to this, we hypothesise that it is likely not a low redshift analogue of the progenitor to a ``failed galaxy'' UDGs.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers play a crucial role in shaping the morphology, the star formation, and the mass growth of galaxies across cosmic time. While mergers have been extensively investigated in the local Universe, the evolution of their frequency and physical properties in the early Universe has yet to be fully understood. We investigate the role of mergers in a large spectroscopic sample of 1233 galaxies in the range 5<z<14 with good detection (S/N-pixel > 3) in JWST imaging, covering six different extragalactic fields. We identify mergers from rest-frame optical disturbances in F444W, using a combination of Gini, M-20, and Asymmetry parameters. We find a morphological merger fraction f_m that does not strongly evolve with redshift from z=0 to z ~ 8. The average f_m of our primary major merger condition (Gini+0.14xM-20 > 0.33, A>0.35) is ~ 5 %, which increases to ~13 % for major+minor merger tracers. Accounting for the evolving observability timescale of each tracer, we find that the merger rate is strongly increasing from z=1 to 7 by more than 1 dex, averaging ~ 2 merger/galaxy/Gyr at 5<z<10 for major mergers (in agreement with photometric pair studies), and a factor of 3 higher for minor+major mergers. We also perform SED modeling using available HST+JWST photometry to infer stellar masses and SFRs, using a non parametric star-formation history. We find that mergers at z > 5 have a significant impact, although significantly lower than at z<1, on the SFR of galaxies. When averaged over 10 Myr (comparable to the observability timescale of morphological disturbances), their SFRs are a factor of 1.7 higher than a mass and redshift matched sample of non-mergers, suggesting that mergers trigger new star-formation through short-lived powerful bursty episodes. Despite this, mergers contribute only by 5% - 10% to the mass build-up of galaxies in the redshift range explored.

 - **Abstract**
 In the past two decades, the observed large-scale magnetic field of the active M dwarf star AD Leo has evolved from strongly to mildly negative, raising a suspicion that it might switch polarity. Although magnetic field reversals are observed every 11 years for the Sun, such reversals are poorly understood for M dwarfs. Further, no reversals have been observed for fast-rotating M dwarfs. We examine the properties of AD Leo's large-scale magnetic field and investigate how its evolution affects the space weather environment. We analysed spectropolarimetric data collected by ESPaDOnS and SPIRou in late-2022 and early-2023. With the optical and near-infrared data we computed the longitudinal magnetic field, and with the near-infrared data reconstructed the large-scale magnetic field using Zeeman-Doppler imaging. Using five magnetograms, from 2019 to 2023, we simulated three-dimensional Alfven wave-driven stellar winds using the space weather code SWMF. Although we see an evolution of the large-scale magnetic field of AD Leo, we find no polarity reversal. Rather, we see a restoration of the field to a simpler configuration with consistently negative values for the longitudinal magnetic field strength. Our new large-scale field reconstruction for AD Leo is characterised by a highly axisymmetric, poloidal-dipolar field with an increased mean large-scale field strength. SWMF simulations find the stellar mass loss rates to be, on average, an order of magnitude greater than that of the Sun. Additionally, we find that the habitable zone resides beyond the Alfven surface. Hypothetical magnetised habitable zone planets (with planetary field strengths greater than 0.34 G) would likely be shielded from the incident wind and atmospheric erosion would be negligible. Further, we find variable conditions across each epoch due to the evolving axisymmetry of the stellar large-scale magnetic field.
#### A Photometric and Spectroscopic investigation of 11 TESS eclipsing contact binaries

 - **Abstract**
 By cross-matching the eclipsing binary catalog provided by Prsa et al. (2022) with LAMOST medium resolution spectra, we obtained 11 targets. Combining light and radial velocity curves analysis, we have derived accurate physical parameters for these 11 targets. The results indicate that there are 3 deep contact binaries, 3 moderate ones, and 5 shallow ones. Among them, 3 targets exhibit the O'Connell effect, which is attributed to the presence of star-spot on the component's surface. One target is a low-mass ratio deep contact binary and may be contact binary merging candidates. The evolutionary status of these 11 targets was studied using the mass-luminosity and mass-radius relation diagrams. Based on the O-C (Observed minus Calculated) analysis of 10 targets, we found that the orbital periods of 5 contact binaries show a long-term decreasing trend, likely due to the combined effects of mass transfer between the two components and loss of angular momentum. Meanwhile, the orbital periods of the other 4 stars are continuously increasing, which is attributed to mass transfer. Besides, the O-C curves of 3 targets show clear periodic changes, which might result from the Applegate mechanism or the light travel time effect.

 - **Abstract**
 Ionised regions around OB-type stars are formed at an early stage of their evolution and are important to investigate the formation process of these objects. However, so far only few observations of their physical structure and interaction with the parental molecular cloud have been made. The high resolution and sensitivity of new instruments such as ALMA and the upgraded VLA allow us to fill this gap in our knowledge. We investigate the well known core-halo ultracompact HII region G31.41+0.31 and the surrounding molecular clump with the aim to determine the density and temperature of both the ionised and neutral gas, and possibly obtain a 3D picture of their spacial distribution. We take advantage of the full-band frequency coverage at 3 mm obtained with ALMA for the GUAPOS project to image the emission of a plethora of hydrogen recombination lines towards the G31.41+0.31 HII region as well as several molecular transitions which are tracers of medium-density ($\sim$$10^4$--$10^6$ cm$^{-3}$) gas. The line data are complemented by continuum measurements obtained with the VLA at 1 cm and 7 mm. By fitting these lines also using a model that takes into account non-LTE effects we can investigate the density and temperature structure and the velocity field of the region. Our findings, based on a model fit accounting for non-LTE effects, indicate that the electron temperature of the HII region is mostly spanning a range between 5000 and 6000 K, while the density varies between 2500 and 7500 cm$^{-3}$. All in all, the distribution of these parameters as well as the corresponding velocity field hint at a cometary shaped HII region expanding away from the observer to the NW. The molecular gas appears to be still infalling towards the peak of the UC HII region, and its density and temperature are consistent with pressure confinement of the ionised gas to the SE.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep radio surveys are now producing catalogues with millions of radio sources. Radio sources can have complex morphologies that depend both on the production mechanisms and the local environment. Recently, an unusual class of circular radio sources have been identified that were named "odd radio circles" (ORC). They have sizes of about 1', a circular/elliptical shape and appear edge brightened. Subsequent observations have suggested that this class may comprise a variety of sources. Despite various attempts to explain these sources, their origin remains unclear. The main goal of this work is to increase the number of known ORCs and derive common characteristics that can help identify the origin of these sources. We searched the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data release 3 (DR3) at 144 MHz for ORCs using a combination of parameter filtering on catalogue entries and visual inspection. We then identified possible optical counterparts and derived information such as redshift, physical size, and spectral index using further radio data at 54 and 1400 MHz. We isolated 18 sources with ORC structures. Four of these are double headed ORCs (ORCs with two rings), and two are new discoveries. We also found 5 new single headed ORCs and 9 candidate ORCs. With this work we significantly expanded the population of known ORCs. Our findings confirms that ORCs are a rare and heterogenous population of radio sources. We confirm the association with large ellipticals in most cases and we note a relation between the ORCs physical size and their integrated spectral index with small ORCs avoiding steep spectra.
#### Linear filament and nested cluster evolution tomography (LANCET) I. Capture the evolution of dense gas in 14-parsec filament G316.8

 - **Abstract**
 A dynamic view of mass assembly is essential for understanding the formation of massive stars and clusters. Interpreting evolutionary diagnostics from Galactic-wide surveys, however, requires careful control of distance and environmental variations. The G316.8 filament provides an ideal laboratory: a 14-pc nearly linear structure composed of three contiguous subregions with comparable molecular gas reservoirs (~10,000 $M_\odot$ each) but spanning a clear evolutionary sequence from an infrared dark cloud (young) through a massive young stellar object (intermediate) to an HII region (evolved). As part of the Linear filament and nested cluster evolution tomography (LANCET) project, we mapped the full filament with the Atacama Compact Array at 1.3 mm, achieving 0.08 pc resolution over 17.1 pc$^2$. Combined with Herschel and APEX/ArTéMiS data, we derived high-resolution temperature and column-density maps. We quantify structural evolution using dense-fragment statistics, column-density PDFs, and $\Delta$-variance analysis. From young to evolved regions, the maximum fragment mass increases from 8 to 490 $M_\odot$, while the dense-gas mass fraction ($>0.5$ g cm$^{-2}$) rises from 0.4% to 9.6%. The N-PDF develops a secondary power-law tail and the $\Delta$-variance slope becomes progressively shallower, indicating ongoing assembly of dense sub-parsec structures. Our further ALMA 12m continuum and spectral line data will extend this dynamic scenarios down to 800 AU scale.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous numerical simulations have shown that cold clumps can form within hot accretion flows, offering insights into the detailed processes of the state transition in black hole X-ray binaries. However, the evolution of the cold clumps has not been investigated in detail yet. In this paper, we conduct hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the evolution of the cold clumps. In addition to previous result that when the accretion rate is high enough the cold clumps emerge within the hot accretion flow, we found that instead of directly moving toward to the black hole, the clumps moves outward when they initially form. The reason should be the combination of viscous torque and the condensation of hot gas from larger radii, which lead to the slightly super-Keplerian angular momentum of the clumps. After reaching the equilibrium position, the clumps begin to fragment at the inner edge with each fragment moving inward sequentially. Generally, the azimuthal movement of the clumps are quasi-Keplerian, being closer to the outer detached Keplerian cold disk rather than the surrounding sub-Keplerian hot accretion flow, which agrees well with the semi-analytical results for weak coupling case in Wang et al. (2012).
