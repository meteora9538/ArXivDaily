 - **Abstract**
 The caustic skeleton model is a mathematically rigorous framework for studying the formation history of the emerging cosmic web from the caustics in the underlying dark matter flow. In a series of two papers, we use constrained N-body simulations to investigate the different cosmic web environments. For the current study, we focus on the cosmic walls. We derive the conditions of the centres of proto-walls and analyse their evolution with N-body simulations. Next, we investigate the statistical properties of Zel'dovich pancakes by studying the number density of the cosmic wall centres in scale space and, for the first time, we calculate the Lagrangian-space volume of cosmic walls. Finally, we infer the mean density and velocity fields and the distribution of haloes around cosmic walls with a suite of physically realistic dark-matter-only simulations. We compare the cosmic walls obtained with the caustic skeleton framework with previously proposed saddle point conditions on the primordial potential and density perturbation.

 - **Abstract**
 It is often understood that supernova (SN) feedback in galaxies is responsible for regulating star formation and generating gaseous outflows. However, a detailed look at their effect on the local interstellar medium (ISM) on small mass scales in simulations shows that these processes proceed in clearly distinct channels. We demonstrate this finding in two independent simulations with solar-mass resolution, LYRA and RIGEL, of an isolated dwarf galaxy. Focusing on the immediate environment surrounding SNe, our findings suggest that the large-scale effect of a given SN on the galaxy is best predicted by its immediate local density. Outflows are driven by SNe in diffuse regions expanding to their cooling radii on large (\sim kpc) scales, while dense star-forming regions are disrupted in a localized (\sim pc) manner. However, these separate feedback channels are only distinguishable at very high numerical resolutions capable of following scales <<10^3 \msun. On larger scales, ISM densities are greatly mis-estimated, and differences between local environments of SNe become severely washed out. We demonstrate the practical implications of this effect by comparing with a mid-resolution simulation (Mptcl. \sim 200 \msun) of the same dwarf using the SMUGGLE model. The coarse-resolution simulation cannot self-consistently determine whether a given SN is responsible for generating outflows or suppressing star formation, suggesting that emergent galaxy physics such as star formation regulation through hot-phase outflows is fundamentally unresolvable by subgrid stellar feedback models, without appealing directly to simulations with highly resolved ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a fast and robust analytic framework for predicting surface brightness (SB) of emission lines in galactic winds as a function of radius up to $\sim 100$ kpc out in the circum-galactic medium. We model multi-phase structure in galactic winds by capturing emission from both the volume-filling hot phase (T $\sim 10^{6-7}$ K) and turbulent radiative mixing layers that host intermediate temperature gas at the boundaries of cold clouds (T $\sim 10^4$ K). Our multi-phase framework makes significantly different predictions of emission signatures compared to traditional single-phase models. We emphasize how ram pressure equilibrium between the cold clouds and hot wind in supersonic outflows, non-equilibrium ionization effects, and energy budgets other than mechanical energy from core-collapse supernovae affect our SB predictions and allow us to better match OVI observations in the literature. Our framework reveals that the optimal galactic wind properties that facilitate OVI emission observations above a detection limit of $\sim 10^{-18} \ \rm{erg \ s^{-1} \ cm^{-2} \ arcsec^{-2}}$ are star formation rate surface density $1 \lesssim \dot{\Sigma}_{\ast} \lesssim 20 \ M_{\odot}\ \rm{yr^{-1}\ kpc^{-2}}$, hot phase mass loading factor $\eta_{\rm M,hot} \sim 0.2 - 0.4$, and thermalization efficiency factor $\eta_{\rm E} \gtrsim 0.8$. These findings are consistent with existing observations and can help inform future target selections.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN), star formation (SF), and galaxy interactions can drive turbulence in the gas of the ISM, which in turn plays a role in the SF within galaxies. The impact on molecular gas is of particular importance, as it serves as the primary fuel for SF. Our goal is to investigate the origin of turbulence and the emission of molecular gas, as well as low- and intermediate-ionization gas, in the inner few kpc of both AGN hosts and SF galaxies. We use JWST MIRI/MRS observations of a sample consisting of 54 galaxies at z<0.1. We present fluxes of the H2 S(5)6.9091, [Ar II]6.9853, [FeII]5.3403, and [Ar III]8.9914 lines, along with velocity dispersion from W80. For galaxies with coronal emission, [Mg V]5.6098 is also included. Line ratios are compared to photoionization and shock models to explore the origin of the gas emission. AGNs exhibit broader emission lines than SFGs, with the largest velocity dispersions observed in radio-strong (RS) AGNs. H2 gas is less turbulent compared to ionized gas, while coronal gas presents higher velocity dispersions. The W80 values for the ionized gas exhibits a decrease from the nucleus out to radii of approximately 0.5--1 kpc, followed by an outward increase up to 2-3 kpc. In contrast, the H2 line widths generally display increasing profiles with distance from the center. Correlations W80 and line ratios such as H2 S(5)/[ArII] and [FeII]/[ArII] indicate that the most turbulent gas is associated with shocks, enhancing H2 and [FeII] emissions. We speculate that these shocked gas regions are produced by AGN outflows and jet-cloud interactions in AGN-dominated sources, while in SFGs, they may be created by stellar winds and mergers. This shock-induced gas heating may be an important mechanism of AGN (or stellar) feedback, preventing the gas from cooling and forming new stars.
#### Analysis of the plane of satellites around Milky Way-like galaxies in $Λ$CDM cosmology

 - **Abstract**
 It has been suggested that the Plane of Satellites (PoS) phenomenon may imply a tension with current $\Lambda$CDM cosmology since a Milky-Way (MW)-like PoS is very rare in simulations. In this study, we analyze a large sample of satellite systems of MW-like galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulations. We analyze their spatial aspect ratio, orbital pole dispersion, Gini coefficient, radial distribution, and bulk satellite velocity relative to the host galaxy. These are compared to the observed Milky~Way PoS. We identified galaxy samples in two mass ranges ($0.1 - 0.8 \times 10^{12} $ M$_\odot$ and $0.8 - 3.0 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$). We find for both mass ranges that only $\sim$ 1 percent of MW-like galaxies contain a PoS similar to that of the MW. Nevertheless, these outliers occur naturally in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We analyze the formation, environment, and evolution of the PoS for nine systems that are most MW-like. We suggest that a PoS can form from one or more of at least five different processes. A massive Magellanic~Cloud (MC)-like satellite is found in 1/3 of the systems and probably plays an important role in the PoS formation. We find a tendency for about half of the satellites to have recently arrived at $z < 0.5$, indicating that a MW-like PoS is a recent and transient phenomenon. We also find that a spin up of the angular momentum amplitude of the most massive satellites is an indicator of the recent in-fall of the PoS satellites.

 - **Abstract**
 Global search and optimization of long-duration, low-thrust spacecraft trajectories with the indirect method is challenging due to a complex solution space and the difficulty of generating good initial guesses for the costate variables. This is particularly true in multibody environments. Given data that reveals a partial Pareto optimal front, it is desirable to find a flexible manner in which the Pareto front can be completed and fronts for related trajectory problems can be found. In this work we use conditional diffusion models to represent the distribution of candidate optimal trajectory solutions. We then introduce into this framework the novel approach of using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms with self-supervised fine-tuning to achieve the aforementioned goals. Specifically, a random walk Metropolis algorithm is employed to propose new data that can be used to fine-tune the diffusion model using a reward-weighted training based on efficient evaluations of constraint violations and missions objective functions. The framework removes the need for separate focused and often tedious data generation phases. Numerical experiments are presented for two problems demonstrating the ability to improve sample quality and explicitly target Pareto optimality based on the theory of Markov chains. The first problem does so for a transfer in the Jupiter-Europa circular restricted three-body problem, where the MCMC approach completes a partial Pareto front. The second problem demonstrates how a dense and superior Pareto front can be generated by the MCMC self-supervised fine-tuning method for a Saturn-Titan transfer starting from the Jupiter-Europa case versus a separate dedicated global search.
#### The origin of the galaxy size-stellar metallicity relation: A semi-analytical perspective

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar metallicity encodes the integrated effects of gas inflow, star formation, and feedback-driven outflow, yet its connection to galaxy structure remains poorly understood. Using SDSS-IV MaNGA, we present the direct observational evidence that, at fixed stellar mass, smaller central galaxies are systematically more metal-rich, with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient reaching $R_{\rm s}\approx -0.4$. The semi-analytical model L-GALAXIES reproduces this anti-correlation, albeit with a stronger amplitude ($R_{\rm s}\approx -0.8$). Within this framework, the trend cannot be explained by differences in gravitational potential depth or star formation history. Instead, smaller galaxies attain higher stellar metallicities because their elevated star formation efficiencies accelerate chemical enrichment, and, at fixed stellar mass, they inhabit less massive haloes, which makes their recycled inflows more metal-rich. The gas-regulator model demonstrates that star formation efficiency affects stellar metallicity when the system has not long remained in equilibrium, which is shown to be the case for central galaxies with $M_{\rm star}\lesssim 10^{10.5}\rm M_\odot$ in both L-GALAXIES and observation. The model also suggests a testable signature that, at fixed stellar mass, larger or lower-metallicity galaxies should inhabit more massive haloes than their smaller and higher-metallicity counterparts, providing a direct and testable imprint of the galaxy size-stellar metallicity relation on the galaxy-halo connection.

 - **Abstract**
 We present mid-infrared spectroscopic observations of intermediate- to high-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) in the low-metallicity star-forming region NGC 346 located within the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We conduct these integral-field-unit observations with the Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectroscopy instrument on board JWST. The brightest and most active star-forming region in the SMC, NGC 346 has a metallicity of $\sim$1/5 $Z_{\odot}$, analogous to the era when star formation in the early Universe ($z$$\simeq$2) peaked. We discuss the emission and absorption features present in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of five YSOs with coverage from 4.9-27.9$\mu$m and three other sources with partial spectral coverage. Via SED model-fitting, we estimate their parameters, finding masses ranging from 2.9-18.0 M$_{\odot}$. These targets show dusty silicates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ices of CO$_2$, CO, H$_2$O and CH$_3$OH in their protostellar envelopes. We measure emission from H$_2$ and atomic fine-structure lines, suggesting the presence of protostellar jets and outflows. We detect H I lines indicating ongoing accretion and estimate accretion rates for each source which range from 2.50x10$^{-6}$-2.23x10$^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ based on H I (7-6) line emission. We present evidence for a $\sim$30,000AU protostellar jet traced by fine-structure, H I and H$_2$ emission about the YSO Y535, the first detection of a resolved protostellar outflow in the SMC, and the most distant yet detected.

 - **Abstract**
 Most M dwarfs show higher chromospheric activity, often exceeding solar levels. Characterizing stellar activity is essential, particularly since these stars are prime targets in the search for habitable exoplanets. We investigate the stellar activity of active M dwarfs using TESS photometry combined with spectroscopic observations. We explore relations between flare occurrence rate (FOR), flare energies, rotation period, starspot filling factor, and chromospheric indicators. We also examine correlations between flare amplitude, duration, and cumulative flare frequency distributions to probe the mechanisms behind magnetic activity. We find that FOR is flat across spectral types M0-M4 but declines for cooler M dwarfs. Rapid rotators ($P_{\rm rot} < 1$ day) display significantly higher FOR and flare activity. M dwarfs with higher FOR tend to have lower flare amplitudes, suggesting that frequent flares are generally less energetic. For stars with 0.15--0.76 $M_\odot$, the median $L_{H\alpha}/L_{\rm bol}$ varies by a factor of 2.5 across mass bins of 0.1 $M_\odot$, while $\Delta$EW decreases by 92\%. The cumulative flare frequency distributions show a decrease in the power-law slope from M0 to M5, with $\alpha$ ranging from 1.68 to 1.95. Our results indicate a transition in stellar activity near M4, where stronger H$\alpha$ emission coincides with higher FOR. We confirm that chromospheric and flare activity follow a power-law relation, highlighting the interplay between magnetic fields and flaring in M dwarfs. We also find that fast rotators sustain frequent flaring through strong dynamos, and that highly active stars dissipate magnetic energy via numerous low-energy flares rather than rare high-energy ones.
#### Ultra-strong MgII absorbers trace both inflowing and outflowing gas: insights from dual down-the-barrel and quasar sightlines

 - **Abstract**
 We present Keck/LRIS spectroscopy of seven isolated galaxy--quasar pairs at $0.4 \leq z \leq 0.6$, each exhibiting ultra-strong MgII absorption ($W_{r,2796} \geq 3$ Å), probing both down-the-barrel and transverse gas flows. Down-the-barrel galaxy spectra reveal outflows in three galaxies ($v = 19$ to $311$ km s$^{-1}$) and inflows in five ($v = 61$ to $361$ km s$^{-1}$), including one system showing inflows and outflows simultaneously. All galaxies with detected inflows are below the star-forming main sequence, suggesting that they might be actively replenishing their gas reservoirs. Outflows have a mean covering fraction of $C_{f, \rm out}=0.5$, whereas inflows show a lower average of $C_{f, \rm in}=0.3$. Mass flow rates span $\dot{M}_{\rm in} = 0.01-1.18$ $M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for inflows and $\dot{M}_{\rm out} = 0.23-1.03$ $M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for outflows, yielding mass loading factors below unity and implying these galaxies cannot sustain their current level of star-formation rates. These results are based on the T $\sim 10^4$ K photoionised gas phase traced by MgII; additional accreting/outflowing material in other gas phases may also be present, but remains undetected in this study. Quasar sightlines consistently show redshifted inflow components and blueshifted outflow components, demonstrating that ultra-strong MgII absorbers trace baryon cycling out to impact parameters of $D = 15$ -- 31 kpc. Moreover, the unexpectedly high prevalence of inflows suggests that ultra-strong MgII absorbers offer a powerful strategy for future surveys to systematically map inflow and outflow cycles across cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-lensing (SL) represents a powerful technique for detecting compact objects in binary systems through gravitational microlensing effects, when a compact companion transits in front of its luminous partner. We present the first comprehensive study of SL probability within globular cluster (GC) environments, utilizing synthetic stellar populations from MOCCA simulations to predict detection rates for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Our analysis incorporates finite-size lens effects for white dwarf (WD) lenses and the specific observational characteristics of the ELT/MICADO instrument. We find that present-day GCs contain 1-50 SL sources with magnifications $\mu_\mathrm{sl} > 1+10^{-8}$, strongly dependent on initial binary fraction, with systems dominated by WD lenses paired with low-mass main-sequence companions. The predicted populations exhibit characteristic bimodal magnitude distributions with peaks at $m \approx 24$ and 32 mag at 10 kpc distance, and typical Einstein ring crossing times of $\tau_\mathrm{eff} \sim 2$ hours. ELT observations should achieve detection efficiency of 0.015-10 sources in $\sim150$ nearby GC after a year of observations depending on distance and survey strategy, with nearby clusters ($D \lesssim 10$ kpc) offering the highest yields. Multi-year monitoring campaigns with daily cadence provide order-of-magnitude improvements over single observations through enhanced photometric precision and increased detection probability. Our results demonstrate that coordinated ELT surveys of Galactic GCs represent a viable approach for probing hidden binary populations and compact object demographics in dense stellar environments, with comprehensive programs potentially yielding up to 10-100 well-characterized SL sources after first 5 years of observations suitable for statistical studies of binary evolution in extreme environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova (SN) explosions interacting with dense circumstellar medium are considered to be very promising sites for efficient cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration and subsequent emission of neutral-pion-decay gamma rays. These environments share similarities with already detected gamma-ray novae, but with much greater available energy content, so it is important to characterize their emission in the very-high-energy range. We present the results of H.E.S.S. observations of one such candidate source - SN 2024ggi, located in NGC 3621 at a distance of 7.24 Mpc. A total of 30 hours of data, gathered throughout a month of post-explosion observations, provide flux upper limits that are used to constrain source parameters, offering meaningful insights for theoretical predictions. We exclude bright gamma-ray emission in the first day after explosion, and later upper limits are consistent with wind densities derived from optical observations.
#### A $z\simeq0.4$ Little Red Dot analog: An Extended Starburst with an Overmassive Black hole

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most remarkable discoveries of JWST is a population of compact, red sources at z > 4, commonly referred to as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Spectroscopic identifications reported that most LRDs are active galactic nuclei (AGNs), which are preferentially found around z~6 and could imply a key phase in the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) in the early universe. Photometric surveys at lower redshift have recently been carried out to trace their evolution across cosmic time, and a small number of LRDs have been spectroscopically identified at both Cosmic Noon and in the local universe. Here we report the discovery of one of the lowest-z analogs of LRDs, J204837.26-002437.2 (hereafter J2048) at z = 0.4332, using new Gemini-N/GMOS IFU observations combined with archival multi-band photometric SED data. The GMOS data reveal extended blue emission from starburst with a star formation rate of 400 Msun yr-1, together with an extended, highly fast ionized outflow. This is the first spectroscopic confirmation of extended host emission and outflow in an LRD-like galaxy, providing a unique laboratory for understanding the nature of their high-redshift counterparts. Moreover, J2048 would host an extremely overmassive BH with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.6, with the BH mass and host stellar mass estimated to be 10^10.2 and 10^10.4 Msun, respectively. We discuss the origin and evolutionary fate of J2048, and the implications that such low-z analogs have for interpreting the properties of high-z LRDs.

 - **Abstract**
 IC 443 is a well-known supernova remnant that stands out due to its interaction with a dense molecular cloud, creating a complex environment where shocks can efficiently accelerate particles to high energies. This makes it a key target for investigating the mechanisms of cosmic-ray acceleration and gamma-ray production, particularly in the context of supernova remnants as potential sources of PeV cosmic rays. This work presents a first analysis of the region as observed by H.E.S.S.. We detect extended very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from IC 443, consistent with previous observations by VERITAS and MAGIC. A multi-wavelength comparison incorporating data from Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, and VERITAS strongly supports a hadronic origin of the observed emission, and highlights the presence of relativistic protons interacting with the surrounding molecular cloud. These findings reinforce the role of IC 443 as a key laboratory for studying supernova remnants as cosmic-ray accelerators and their interaction with their surrounding mediums.

 - **Abstract**
 Low metallicity stellar populations are very abundant in the Universe, either as the remnants of the past history of the Milky Way or similar spiral galaxies, or the young low metallicity stellar populations that are being observed in the local dwarf galaxies or in the high-z objects with low metal content recently found with JWST. Our goal is to develop new high-spectral-resolution models tailored for low-metallicity environments and apply them to analyse stellar population data, particularly in cases where a significant portion of the stellar content exhibits low metallicity. Methods. We used the state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis code HR-pyPopStar with available stellar libraries to create a new set of models focused on low metallicity stellar populations. We have compared the new spectral energy distributions with the previous models of HR-pyPopStar for solar metallicity. Once we verified that the spectra, except for the oldest ages that show some differences in the molecular bands of the TiO and G band, are similar, we reanalysed the high resolution data from the globular cluster M 15 by finding a better estimate of its age and metallicity. Finally, we analysed a subsample of mostly star-forming dwarf galaxies from the MaNGA survey we found similar stellar mass-mean stellar metallicity weighted by light to other studies that studied star forming dwarf galaxies and slightly higher mean stellar metallicity than the other works that analysed all types of dwarf galaxies at the same time, but are within error bars.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of refractory molecules in massive star-forming regions provides a means of probing the innermost regions of disks around massive stars. These detections also make it possible to explore the chemical composition of refractories through gas-phase observations. In this regard, identifying refractory compounds containing sulfur could reveal potential connections between sulfur and refractories, as well as help determine the sulfur budget in these extreme environments. We find convincing evidence of a reliable detection of CaS, and tentative detections of KS and KSH in the disk G351.77-mm1. These are the first ever identifications of these species in the interstellar medium. The CaS, KS, and KSH column densities are about 3 orders of magnitude lower than those of the abundant sulfur compounds SO$_2$, CH$_3$SH and SiS, proving that these species are not the major reservoir of sulfur at the spatial scales probed by our observations. Higher angular resolution observations at different wavelengths are required to confirm these detections, which are of paramount importance to gain insights into the formation of gas-phase refractory molecules.

 - **Abstract**
 M31, as the largest galaxy in the Local Group, is of significant importance for the study of stellar formation and evolution. Based on the data of 5,859 targets observed in M31 by Gu et al (\citeyear{2024ApJS..273....9G}), we selected 30 contact binaries by visual inspection for further study. Using the PHOEBE software and employing Bayesian optimization and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, we determined the physical parameters of these 30 systems. The results show that 10 systems exhibit the O'Connell effect, which is well explained by introducing a dark spot on the primary star. 11 systems have mass ratios below 0.15, classifying them as extremely low mass ratio contact binaries, making them promising candidates for binary mergers. Six systems have primary star temperatures exceeding 10,000 K, classifying them as early-type contact binaries. The absolute physical parameters reveal that two contact binary systems contain massive stellar components, which may eventually evolve into compact binary star systems. To compare the effects of different galactic environments on the evolution of contact binaries, we constructed evolutionary diagrams for these 30 targets and for contact binaries in the Milky Way. The results show that, at the same mass, our targets have larger radii, higher luminosities, and lower orbital angular momenta than contact binaries in the Milky Way, indicating that they are at more advanced evolutionary stages. This may be attributed to the higher metallicity in M31 compared to the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We study solar differential rotation (DR) for solar cycle No. 19 (1954-1964) by tracing sunspot groups on the sunspot drawings of Kanzelhoehe Observatory for Solar and Environmental Research (KSO). Our aim is to extend previous DR analysis from the KSO data (1964-2016) to the years prior to 1964 to create a catalog of sunspot group positions and DR parameters from KSO sunspot drawings and white light images. Synodic angular rotation velocities were first determined using the daily shift (DS) and robust linear least-squares fit (rLSQ) methods, then converted to sidereal velocities, and used to derive solar DR parameters. We compare the DR parameters obtained from different sources and analyse the north-south asymmetry of rotation for solar cycle No. 19. It has been shown that our results for the equatorial rotation velocity (parameter A) and the gradient of DR (parameter B) coincide with earlier results from the KSO data (performed with a different method), as well as with results from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KoSO) and the Yunnan Observatories (YNAO). In contrast, the values of parameter A from three different earlier studies based on the Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR) exhibit statistically significant differences when compared to the values of parameter A derived from KSO, KoSO and YNAO. These findings suggest that the GPR data have the largest inconsistency compared to the other three data sources, highlighting the need for further analysis to identify the causes of these discrepancies. The analysis of the north-south asymmetry in the solar rotation profile using two different methods shows that the DR parameters of the hemispheres coincide, indicating a rotational symmetry around the equator. This is consistent with previous results from KSO and YNAO data. However, all sources indicate slightly higher equatorial rotation velocities in the southern hemisphere.

 - **Abstract**
 The persistence of radiative signatures in giant radio galaxies remains a frontier topic of research, with contemporary telescopes revealing intricate features that require investigation. This study aims to examine the emission characteristics of simulated GRGs, and correlate them with their underlying 3D dynamical properties. Sky-projected continuum and polarization maps at 1 GHz were computed from five 3D-RMHD simulations by integrating the synthesized emissivity data along the line of sight, with the integration path chosen to reflect the GRG evolution in the sky plane. The emissivities were derived from these RMHD simulations, featuring FR-I and FR-II jets injected from different locations of the large-scale environment. The jet-cocoon morphologies are strongly shaped by the triaxiality of the environment, resulting in features like wings and asymmetric cocoons, thereby making morphology a crucial indicator of GRG formation mechanisms. The decollimation of the bulk flow in GRG jets gives rise to intricate cocoon features, most notably filamentary structures-magnetically dominated threads with lifespans of a few Myr. High-jet-power cases frequently display enhanced emission zones at mid-cocoon distances (alongside warmspots around the jet-head), contradicting the interpretations of the GRG as a restarting source. In such cases, examining the lateral intensity variation of the cocoon may reveal the source's state, with a gradual decrease in emission suggesting a low-active stage. This study highlights that applying a simple radio power-jet power relation to a statistical GRG sample is unfeasible, as it depends on growth conditions of individual GRGs. Effects such as inverse-Compton CMB cooling and matter entrainment significantly impact the long-term emission persistence of GRGs. The diminishing fractional polarization with GRG evolution reflects increasing turbulence in the cocoon.

 - **Abstract**
 In addition to the radio continuum emission of the thin galactic disk, vertically extended emission is ubiquitous in starforming disk galaxies. This halo emission can represent an important fraction of the total emission of the galaxy The cosmic ray electrons (CRe) responsible for the radio continuum emission are produced within the thin disk and transported into the halo. We made an attempt to reconstruct the radial properties of radio continuum halos in nearly edge-on galaxies where the star formation rate (SFR) distribution can be deprojected and the vertical radio continuum emission is well distinct from the disk emission. The deprojected SFR distribution is convolved with a Gaussian kernel to take CRe diffusion within the galactic disk into account and a vertical profile of the radio continuum emissivity is added to the disk emission. The three-dimensional emission distribution is then projected on the sky and compared to VLA radio continuum observations at 20 and 6 cm. We found that overall the halo emission contains information on the underlying distribution of the star formation rate. The majority of our galaxies show flaring radio continuum halos. Except for one galaxy, our Virgo galaxies follow the trend of increasing effective height with increasing radio continuum size found by the CHANG-ES collaboration. We confirm that radio continuum halos can represent a significant fraction of the total radio continuum emission of a starforming spiral galaxy. At 20 cm and 6 cm between 30 and 70 of the total radio continuum emission originate in the halo. We propose a halo classification based on the height ratio and SI between 20 and 6cm. If we interpret the vertical structures of the large-scale magnetic field within the disk-halo and halo types as a sign of a galactic outflow or wind, all galaxies except one most probably harbor an advection-dominated halo.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding galaxy evolution is key to explaining the structures we observe in the present-day Universe. Counterrotating stellar disks (CRDs), i.e. co-spatial stellar disks rotating with opposite angular momentum, have been proposed as signatures of past accretion events. Therefore, they constitute potentially valuable tracers of galactic assembly. We aim to investigate the properties, formation, and significance of CRDs in a sample of Milky Way mass galaxies using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. We select 260 central late-type galaxies (i.e. $M_{\rm tot} \approx 10^{12}$, $D/T>0.5$, $N_{\rm star}>10^5$). For each galaxy, we measure the circularity of its stellar particles and define the CRD by considering all particles with circularity $\epsilon < -0.7$, which are located within the spatial extension of the main disk. We then characterize the mass fraction, spatial extent, and star formation history of the CRDs. Out of the 260 galaxies, we find that 26 host significant CRDs (i.e. contributing at least 1\% of the total stellar mass of the disk). This means that CRDs are rare, consistent with the results from observations. We also find that the most of the CRDs are compact (i.e. 88\%), in-situ dominated (i.e.73\%), and exhibit bursty SFHs whose peaks often coincide with external perturbations. This means that external perturbations are able to catalyze star formation, even when a majority of the CRD's star population is in-situ. Finally, we find that a variety of formation pathways can lead to CRDs, including interaction-induced in-situ bursts and smooth accretion of misaligned gas. Overall, our results suggest that CRDs are rare but diverse in origin. In most cases, their formation is linked to the accretion of retrograde gas, either through mergers or environmental inflow, suggesting that these structures are sensitive tracers of the galaxy's past accretion history.

 - **Abstract**
 The equipartition model is widely used to estimate magnetic field strength from synchrotron intensity in radio galaxies, yet the validity of its underlying assumptions remains uncertain. Using an Arepo simulation which incorporates a two-moment cosmic ray (CR) transport scheme and a multiphase interstellar medium, we compare magnetic fields inferred from synthetic synchrotron emission maps with the true fields in the simulation. Starting from the derivation of the equipartition formula, we find that the deviation between the equipartition magnetic field and the true magnetic field depends only weakly on the ratio of the magnetic to the CR energy density. In practice, for both face-on and edge-on projections, the equipartition model slightly overestimates the total synchrotron-weighted magnetic field with mean offsets of 32% (0.17 dex) and 36% (0.2 dex), even though the energy equipartition does not hold locally. Beyond these average offsets, a clear trend emerges in edge-on projections that the model underestimates the field in the disk and overestimates it in the halo. Our results demonstrate that the validity of the equipartition model depends only weakly on the strict fulfillment of energy equipartition, and that the equipartition model remains a practical method for estimating magnetic field strengths in face-on projection maps based on our CR-magnetohydrodynamics simulation.
